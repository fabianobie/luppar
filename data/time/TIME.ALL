THE ALLIES AFTER NASSAU IN DECEMBER 1960, THE U.S . FIRST

PROPOSED TO HELP NATO DEVELOP ITS OWN NUCLEAR STRIKE FORCE . BUT EUROPE

MADE NO ATTEMPT TO DEVISE A PLAN . LAST WEEK, AS THEY STUDIED THE

NASSAU ACCORD BETWEEN PRESIDENT KENNEDY AND PRIME MINISTER MACMILLAN,

EUROPEANS SAW EMERGING THE FIRST OUTLINES OF THE NUCLEAR NATO THAT THE

U.S . WANTS AND WILL SUPPORT . IT ALL SPRANG FROM THE ANGLO-U.S .

CRISIS OVER CANCELLATION OF THE BUG-RIDDEN SKYBOLT MISSILE, AND THE

U.S . OFFER TO SUPPLY BRITAIN AND FRANCE WITH THE PROVED POLARIS (TIME,

DEC . 28) . THE ONE ALLIED LEADER WHO UNRESERVEDLY WELCOMED THE POLARIS

OFFER WAS HAROLD MACMILLAN, WHO BY THUS KEEPING A SEPARATE NUCLEAR

DETERRENT FOR BRITAIN HAD SAVED HIS OWN NECK . BACK FROM NASSAU, THE

PRIME MINISTER BEAMED THAT BRITAIN NOW HAD A WEAPON THAT " WILL LAST A

GENERATION . THE TERMS ARE VERY GOOD . " MANY OTHER BRITONS WERE NOT SO

SURE . THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT WILL SHOULDER NONE OF THE $800 MILLION

DEVELOPMENT COST OF POLARIS, IT HAS ALREADY POURED $28 MILLION INTO

SKYBOLT AND WILL HAVE TO SPEND PERHAPS $1 BILLION MORE FOR A FLEET OF

MISSILE-PACKING SUBMARINES . AT BEST, THE BRITISH WILL NOT BE ABLE TO

DESIGN, BUILD AND PROVE ITS NUCLEAR FLEET BEFORE 1970, THREE YEARS

AFTER BRITAIN'S BOMBER FORCE HAS PRESUMABLY BECOME OBSOLETE . THEN WHAT

? TORY BACKBENCHERS ARE LOUDLY SKEPTICAL OF WHAT THEY CALL " THE

SMALL TYPE " IN THE NASSAU PACT, WHICH STIPULATES THAT BRITAIN'S

POLARIS SUBMARINE FLEET, EXCEPT WHEN " SUPREME NATIONAL INTERESTS "

INTERVENE, MUST BE COMMITTED TO A TRULY MULTILATERAL NATO FORCE . DOES

THAT MEAN THAT BRITAIN WILL EVENTUALLY HAVE NO STRIKE FORCE OF ITS OWN

? WHO WILL DECIDE WHEN OR WHETHER NATIONAL INTERESTS JUSTIFY

WITHDRAWAL OF SUBMARINES FROM NATO, PARTICULARLY IF THOSE NATIONAL

INTERESTS CONFLICT WITH U.S . POLICY ? THE BIGGEST QUESTION OF ALL IS

WHETHER FRANCE'S INCLUSION IN THE OFFER WAS A DELIBERATE PLOY BY JACK

KENNEDY TO END OR AT LEAST DOWNGRADE BRITAIN'S PRIZED " SPECIAL

RELATIONSHIP " WITH THE U.S . THE CARTOONISTS WENT EVEN FARTHER . THEY

NOT ONLY SHOWED SUPERMAC JUMPING TO SUPERJACK'S COMMANDS, BUT DE GAULLE

AND ADENAUER AS WELL . AS EDITH SAID . THE FRENCH, WHO GOT NO HELP FROM

THE U.S . IN DEVELOPING THEIR FORCE DE FRAPPE, WERE QUICK TO CROW THAT

BRITAIN'S VAUNTED TIES WITH THE U.S . HAD BROUGHT IT NOTHING BUT

HUMILIATION . BY CONTRAST, BRAGGED FRENCH OFFICIALS, THE SKYBOLT FIASCO

ONLY VINDICATED FRANCE'S DECISION TO DEVELOP ITS OWN BOMBS AND DELIVERY

SYSTEMS . THUS, THOUGH CHARLES DE GAULLE PROMISED TO " REFLECT " ON THE

POLARIS OFFER, THERE WAS LITTLE LIKELIHOOD THAT HE WOULD ACCEPT ANY

OFFER THAT WOULD SUBJECT A FRENCH FORCE TO ALLIED CONTROL . IT IS DE

GAULLE'S UNSWERVING CONVICTION THAT IF THE RUSSIANS WERE ACTUALLY TO

INVADE WESTERN EUROPE, NO NATION THAT WAS NOT DIRECTLY ATTACKED MEANING

THE U.S . WOULD INVITE NUCLEAR DEVASTATION BY HELPING ITS ALLIES . THUS

UNLIKE BRITAIN'S BOMBER FORCE, WHICH ALL ALONG HAS BEEN PLEDGED TO "

THE WESTERN STRATEGIC DETERRENT, " FRANCE'S FORCE DE FRAPPE WILL BE

RESPONSIBLE ONLY FOR FRANCE'S DEFENSE . AT THE SAME TIME, DE GAULLE HAS

LONG ARGUED THAT THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE COULD BE RUN MOST EFFICIENTLY BY

A TRIUMVIRATE THAT WOULD INCLUDE FRANCE AS AN EQUAL OF THE U.S . AND

BRITAIN . THIS IS ONE OF HIS MAJOR, IF UNSPOKEN, CONDITIONS FOR BRITISH

MEMBERSHIP IN THE COMMON MARKET ; AND DE GAULLE SUGGESTED POINTEDLY TO

MACMILLAN THAT IT WOULD HELP IF BRITAIN WERE TO SHARE ITS ADVANCED

MISSILE TECHNOLOGY WITH FRANCE . WHEN MACMILLAN REPLIED NONCOMMITTALLY

THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO DISCUSS THIS WITH KENNEDY, DE GAULLE TOLD HIS

GUEST WITH HAUTEUR THAT FRANCE IN THAT CASE COULD DO NOTHING TO EASE

BRITAIN'S ENTRY INTO EUROPE . GO-IT-ALONE GRANDEUR . KONRAD ADENAUER,

ON THE OTHER HAND, IS FEARFUL THAT DE GAULLE WILL SNAP UP THE POLARIS

OFFER AND IN THIS WAY ACHIEVE HIS GOAL OF A THREE-NATION NATO

DIRECTORATE . THOUGH HIS GOVERNMENT VOWED IN 1954 NOT TO MANUFACTURE

NUCLEAR WEAPONS, ADENAUER HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY APPREHENSIVE THAT

WITHOUT THEM, AND WITH NO SAY IN THEIR USE, WEST GERMANY WILL BE

RELEGATED TO SECOND-CLASS CITIZENSHIP IN THE ALLIANCE . LAST WEEK AN

OFFICIAL BULLETIN EVEN REVIVED THE OLD, BITTER CRY THAT U.S . PLEAS FOR

GREATER RELIANCE ON CONVENTIONAL FORCES ARE AIMED AT RAISING GERMAN "

CANNON FODDER " FOR U.S . " ATOMIC KNIGHTS . " A FROSTY LETTER FROM THE

CHANCELLOR TO PRESIDENT KENNEDY SUGGESTED THAT GERMANY, WHICH ALREADY

SUPPLIES ALMOST 50 PER CENT OF NATO GROUND STRENGTH, DOES NOT INTEND TO

RAISE ANY MORE DIVISIONS FOR CONVENTIONAL WARFARE . YET U.S . STRATEGIC

PLANNERS REASON THAT THE ONLY CREDIBLE DETERRENT TO SOVIET ATTACK IS A

STRONG ARMY ON THE GROUND, BACKED BY THE VAST U.S . NUCLEAR ARSENAL .

FACT IS, THE BRITISH AND FRENCH NUCLEAR WEAPONS COULD NEVER BE USED

INDEPENDENTLY OF THE U.S . AGAINST RUSSIA WITHOUT INVITING DEVASTATING

SOVIET RETALIATION . AFTER ALL THEIR EFFORTS, THE BRITISH AND FRENCH

WILL HAVE MANAGED TO CREATE A NUCLEAR CAPACITY THAT REPRESENTS ONLY 4

PER CENT OF U.S . NUCLEAR POWER . " IT IS JUST A DAMNED NUISANCE, "

SAID A STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL LAST WEEK . " IT MEANS NOTHING

MILITARILY EXCEPT THAT WE WILL BE EXPECTED TO BAIL OUT THE FIRST

COUNTRY THAT THROWS THE FIRST PEA AT THE RUSSIANS OR ANYONE ELSE . "

CHARLES DE GAULLE COULD HARDLY BE EXPECTED TO AGREE, AT LEAST UNTIL HIS

FORCE DE FRAPPE BECOMES OBSOLETE . FOR BRITAIN AND GERMANY, THE

MULTILATERAL DETERRENT MAKES IMMEDIATE SENSE . EVENTUALLY, FRANCE, TOO,

MAY WELL FIND A NATO-CONTROLLED POLARIS FLEET, OR ITS POSSIBLE

SUCCESSOR, A EUROPEAN MINUTEMAN ARSENAL, THE ONLY ANSWER TO THE

SPIRALING COST AND DIMINISHING VALUE OF GO-IT-ALONE GRANDEUR .

RUSSIA WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE ? IT WAS IN 1954 THAT NIKITA

KHRUSHCHEV LAUNCHED HIS GRANDIOSE " VIRGIN LANDS " GAMBLE . PART OF THE

PLAN WAS TO PLOW UP 32 MILLION ACRES OF MARGINAL LAND IN KAZAKHSTAN,

AND SETTLE IT WITH COMMUNIST " PIONEERS, " WHO WERE TO PLANT AND

PRODUCE HUGE QUANTITIES OF DESPERATELY NEEDED GRAIN WITHIN TWO YEARS .

NIKITA'S SCHEME FLOPPED . THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH RAINFALL, AND THE

PIONEERS DID NOT TAKE TO TRACTOR LIFE ON THE BLEAK FRONTIER . EXCEPT

FOR 1958, EACH HARVEST HAS BEEN LOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS YEAR'S . WORST

YEAR OF ALL WAS 1962, WHEN THE VIRGIN LANDS DELIVERED ONLY HALF THEIR

QUOTAS . NATURALLY, KHRUSHCHEV TAKES NONE OF THE BLAME FOR THE FIASCO .

THREE YEARS AGO HE FOUND A SCAPEGOAT IN KAZAKHSTAN PARTY BOSS NIKOLAI

BELYAEV, FIRED HIM FOR HIS " ERRORS . " LAST WEEK BELYAEV'S SUCCESSOR,

DINMUKHAMED KUNAEV, WAS SIMILARLY BOUNCED FOR " LAPSES " IN HIS WORK .

FOR GOOD MEASURE, MOSCOW ALSO PURGED THE FORMER PREMIER OF THE

TERRITORY FROM THE LOCAL PARTY'S CENTRAL COMMITTEE . IT WAS PERHAPS NO

COINCIDENCE THAT NIKOLAI IGNATOV, 61, A ONETIME KHRUSHCHEV CRONY, LAST

WEEK ABRUPTLY LEFT HIS POST AS A SOVIET DEPUTY PREMIER AFTER ONLY NINE

MONTHS ON THE JOB . FARM EXPERT IGNATOV HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO BE BOSS

OF A SPECIAL COMMITTEE TO BOOST FOOD PRODUCTION .

BERLIN ONE LAST RUN HANS WEIDNER HAD BEEN HOPING FOR MONTHS TO

ESCAPE DRAB EAST GERMANY AND MAKE HIS WAY TO THE WEST . THE ODDS WERE

AGAINST HIM, FOR WEIDNER, 40, WAS A CRIPPLE ON CRUTCHES WHO LIVED IN

THE VILLAGE OF NEUGERSDORF, 115 MILES SOUTHEAST OF THE FRONTIER OF

FREEDOM BUT HANS WEIDNER DID HAVE ONE MAJOR ASSET, THE BUS THAT

HE OPERATED FOR THE LOCAL COMMUNIST REGIME . IT WAS AN UGLY THING, AND

ANCIENT . ITS CHASSIS CREAKED, AND THE ENGINE COUGHED ; A

CREAM-COLORED COAT OF PAINT COULD NOT DISGUISE THE WELTS AND BRUISES OF

TWO DECADES OF CHUGGING SERVICE . IN FACT, THE BUS WAS READY FOR THE

JUNK PILE WHEN WEIDNER DECIDED TO PRESS IT INTO SERVICE FOR ONE LAST

RUN . SHARP BLADES . THE HAZARDS WOULD BE GREAT ON THE JOURNEY TO THE

BORDER ; SO WEIDNER SIGNED UP A FELLOW VILLAGER, JURGEN WAGNER, 22, TO

TAKE THE WHEEL . EIGHT DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS, THE PAIR BEGAN THE

FEVERISH PREPARATIONS IN WEIDNER'S GARAGE . FIRST WEIDNER AND WAGNER

ATTACHED A HEAVY SNOWPLOW TO THE FRONT OF THE BUS, NOT TO PLOW SNOW,

BUT TO SCOOP AWAY THE HEAVY OBSTACLES THEY KNEW AWAITED THEM AT

ROADBLOCKS AHEAD . TO ALL SIX LUGS ON EACH FRONT WHEEL THEY BOLTED

SHARP BLADES OF THE TOUGHEST STEEL, AFFIXED SO THAT THE WHIRLING EDGES

WOULD CHOP BARBED WIRE TO BITS . THEN THEY WEDGED ONE-QUARTER-INCH

SECTIONS OF STEEL PLATE INSIDE THE BUS TO STOP BULLETS . AT LAST ALL

WAS READY . ON CHRISTMAS EVE, WEIDNER AND WAGNER PILED THEIR WIVES AND

FOUR CHILDREN ABOARD, NOT FORGETTING THREE TONS OF HOUSEHOLD BELONGINGS

. FOR ADDED PROTECTION THE PLOTTERS SHOVELED A TON OF COAL AND POTATOES

INTO THE BACK OF THE BUS . THEN THEY CHUGGED OFF NORTH TOWARD BERLIN

ALONG BACK ROADS TO ESCAPE COMMUNIST PATROLS . JUST BEFORE THEY REACHED

THE WALL, THEY PLANNED TO SWING WEST IN ORDER TO ENTER THE EAST-WEST

AUTOBAHN LEADING TO THE U.S . SECTOR OF THE CITY . EN ROUTE, THE

RADIATOR FROZE IN THE SUBZERO WEATHER . THAT FIXED, THEY WERE ONLY A

FEW MILES FARTHER WHEN A TIRE BLEW OUT . THE KIDS WERE CRYING AND THE

WIVES SHIVERING WITH COLD AND PANIC WHEN, AT LAST, THEY ARRIVED AT

DREWITZ, THE MOST HEAVILY GUARDED CHECKPOINT ON THE ENTIRE AUTOBAHN TO

BERLIN . IT WAS NO TIME TO STOP AND RECONSIDER . FLYING POTATOES . "

WAH-AH, WAH-AH, " SHRIEKED THE POLICE-TYPE KLAXONS THAT WEIDNER HAD

THOUGHTFULLY INSTALLED IN ADVANCE . THE COMMUNIST GUARDS OBEDIENTLY

RAISED THE FIRST OF THREE BARRIERS . BUT WHAT WAS A BUS DOING ON

EMERGENCY DUTY ? SUDDENLY THE SHOOTING BEGAN TOO LATE . WAGNER, AT 40

M.P.H., WAS ALREADY CRASHING THROUGH THE SECOND BARRIER 100 YARDS

AHEAD, THEN THE THIRD, ONLY 20 YARDS AWAY . ITS WINDSHIELD SMASHED, ITS

PASSENGERS SHAKEN, ITS CARGO OF COAL AND POTATOES IN EVERY CORNER OF

THE CAB, THE OLD BUS FINALLY LURCHED TO A STOP A FEW MILES DOWN THE

ROAD WHERE THE COMMUNISTS NO LONGER MATTERED AT THE U.S . CHECKPOINT, A

FOOT OR TWO INSIDE WEST BERLIN .

THEY FIRST SPOTTED THE TEACHER, ONE RUDOLF FRIEDMAN, AS HE MUTTERED

UNCOMPLIMENTARY REMARKS ABOUT SOCIALIST REALISM WHILE STROLLING THROUGH

LENINGRAD'S RUSSIAN MUSEUM . A WELL-DRESSED U.S . TOURIST APPROACHED

FRIEDMAN REPRODUCTIONS OF AVANT-GARDE PAINTINGS FROM AMERICA . THE

PICTURE FRIEDMAN LIKED BEST, SAID THE COPS INDIGNANTLY, WAS A " CHAOS

OF BLACK, RED AND BLUE SPLOTCHES CAPTIONED I NEED YOU TONIGHT . " SOON,

THE CONGO ROUND 3 ? THE SOUND OF

CHRISTMAS IN KATANGA PROVINCE WAS THE THUNK OF MORTAR SHELLS AND THE

RATTLE OF MACHINE GUNS . AFTER AN UNEASY TWELVE-MONTH TRUCE BETWEEN U.N

. FORCES AND THE TROOPS OF KATANGA'S SECESSIONIST MOISE TSHOMBE, A FEW

MINOR INCIDENTS GOT OUT OF HAND, AND FOR THE THIRD TIME SINCE SEPTEMBER

1961 THE PROVINCE WAS IN TURMOIL . BLUE-HELMETED U.N . SOLDIERS SWARMED

THROUGH ELISABETHVILLE, SEIZED ROADBLOCKS ON THE HIGHWAYS . SWEDISH U.N

. SAAB JETS SWOOPED LOW OVER KATANGA'S AIRFIELD AT KOLWEZI, DESTROYING

FOUR PLANES ON THE GROUND AND SETTING OIL TANKS ABLAZE . IN THE FIRST

SKIRMISHES, SEVEN U.N . SOLDIERS WERE DEAD . THE FIGHTING BEGAN WITH

WHAT ELISABETHVILLE RESIDENTS CALL " L'AFFAIRE SIMBA " A REFERENCE TO

SIMBA BEER, THE LOCAL BREW THAT BOTH SIDES GUZZLED ON AND OFF DUTY . AS

THE U.N . TOLD IT, BOOZED-UP KATANGESE GENDARMES SUDDENLY OPENED FIRE

ON A DETACHMENT OF ETHIOPIAN U.N . TROOPS IN SUBURBAN LUBUMBASHI . AS

TSHOMBE DESCRIBED MATTERS, A FEW TIPSY ETHIOPIANS STARTED THE SHOOTING

BY SCRAMBLING ATOP A 200-FT . SLAG HEAP OUTSIDE THE BIG UNION MINIERE

PLANT AND TAKING POTSHOTS AT THE KATANGESE . FIREWORKS NEXT . IN ANY

CASE, KATANGESE SOLDIERS AT A GOLF COURSE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF

ELISABETHVILLE TOOK THE OCCASION TO SHOOT DOWN AN UNARMED U.N .

HELICOPTER MOVING OVERHEAD . THEY STONED THE SIX SURVIVING CREWMEN,

PUMMELED THEM WITH RIFLE BUTTS ; A 23-YEAR-OLD SIKH LIEUTENANT, WHO

LAY HELPLESS WITH A MACHINE GUN SLUG IN THE ABDOMEN, DIED UNATTENDED IN

THREE HOURS . INDIAN BRIGADIER REGINALD NORONHA, COMMANDER OF U.N .

TROOPS IN KATANGA'S CAPITAL, WAS FURIOUS THIS IS THE LAST TIME, HE SAID

. " NEXT TIME THERE ARE GOING TO BE FIREWORKS . " NORONHA DID NOT HAVE

LONG TO WAIT . THREE DAYS LATER AN ETHIOPIAN GUARD FIRED A WARNING SHOT

AT A KATANGESE SOLDIER WHO WAS APPROACHING HIS POST . UNHURT, THE

KATANGESE ROLLED DOWN A HILL IN SEARCH OF COVER, BUT HIS COMRADES

THOUGHT HE HAD BEEN HIT AND OPENED FIRE . SOON U.N . POSITIONS AROUND

THE CITY WERE UNDER ATTACK . TSHOMBE " AGREED " TO A CEASE-FIRE, BUT

HIS 20,000 MEN KEPT RIGHT ON FIGHTING . " THEY ARE MAD, " SAID A RED

CROSS OFFICIAL WHO SAW THEM RAMPAGING THROUGH A TOWNSHIP, FIRING AT

ANYTHING THAT MOVED . " THEY ARE KILLING THEIR OWN MEN . " THE U.N .

CLAIMED TSHOMBE HAD LOST CONTROL OF HIS MEN WHICH GAVE IT AN EXCUSE TO

STRIKE BACK . FROM MANHATTAN U.N . HEADQUARTERS, ORDERS WERE FLASHED TO

THE 12,000-MAN U.N . FORCE IN KATANGA : " TAKE ALL NECESSARY ACTION IN

SELF-DEFENSE AND TO RESTORE ORDER . " SPEARHEADED BY 5,700 TOUGH,

BITTER GURKHAS, THE U.N . FORCE METHODICALLY SWEPT DISORGANIZED

KATANGESE TROOPS FROM THEIR GUARDPOSTS ON THE ROAD TO NORTHERN RHODESIA

. POWER LINES FELL IN THE FRAY, LEAVING SHABBY LITTLE ELISABETHVILLE

(POP . 180,000) WITHOUT LIGHT, WATER OR PHONES .

SPEARS & ARROWS . NORONHA DEMANDED ONCE MORE

THAT TSHOMBE CALL A CEASEFIRE, WARNED THAT UNLESS HE COMPLIED IN 30

MINUTES, " A GENERAL WAR WILL BEGIN . " TSHOMBE REJECTED THE ULTIMATUM,

AND THE U.N . WENT OVER TO AN ALL-OUT AIR AND GROUND OFFENSIVE . THE

INDIAN BRIGADE STORMED AND CAPTURED THE HEADQUARTERS OF KATANGA'S

GENDARMERIE AT KARAVIA, A MILE FROM ELISABETHVILLE, WITH LITTLE

RESISTANCE . ANOTHER COLUMN OF TROOPS ADVANCED NORTHWEST TOWARD

JADOTVILLE, IN THE HEART OF THE COPPER BELT THAT GIVES TSHOMBE $40

MILLION A YEAR IN REVENUES . U.N . FORCES ANNOUNCED THAT THEY HAD TAKEN

OVER ELISABETHVILLE'S POST OFFICE, RADIO STATION AND RAILWAY DEPOT AND

HAD OCCUPIED TSHOMBE'S PALACE . AT THE HEIGHT OF THE SHOOTING, TSHOMBE

VANISHED INTO HIDING, BUT HE WAS NOT CALLING IT QUITS . " EVERYWHERE,

THE U.N . AND ITS TROOPS WILL BE FOUGHT WITH TRAPS, WITH POISONED

ARROWS AND SPEARS, " HE SAID IN AN ANGRY STATEMENT THROUGH ONE OF HIS

AIDES . " WE WILL RESIST BY ALL MEANS, INCLUDING THE TOTAL DESTRUCTION

OF ALL OUR ECONOMIC POTENTIAL . " WAS THIS THE FINAL SHOWDOWN IN THE

U.N.'S 2F-YEAR ATTEMPT TO END KATANGA'S SECESSION FROM THE CONGO ?

U.N . SPOKESMEN INSISTED THAT IT WAS NOT, BUT SECRETARY-GENERAL U THANT

SAYS HE IS CONVINCED THAT UNLESS TSHOMBE IS SUBDUED SOON, PREMIER

CYRILLE ADOULA'S CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IN LEOPOLDVILLE WILL COLLAPSE . THE

U.S . AGREES, AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT RECENTLY HAS BEEN TALKING UP THE

IMMINENT DANGER OF A LEFTIST, SOVIET-BACKED TAKEOVER IN LEOPOLDVILLE .

BUT THE BRITISH, WHO SEE KATANGA AS A STABLE BUFFER FOR THE RHODESIAS,

WARNED AGAINST THE " FUTILITY OF TRYING TO IMPOSE A POLITICAL

SETTLEMENT BY FORCE . " THE FRENCH, WHO, LIKE THE BRITISH, HAVE HEAVY

TUNISIA DOUBLE JEOPARDY AS A DEDICATED TUNISIAN NATIONALIST,

PRESIDENT HABIB BOURGUIBA, 59, IS A POPULAR HERO TO MOST OF THE

MILLIONS WHO HAVE FOLLOWED HIM SINCE INDEPENDENCE WAS WON IN 1956 . BUT

BOURGUIBA ALSO HAS HIS DEADLY ENEMIES . LAST WEEK A DETERMINED GROUP OF

THE LATTER ALMOST SUCCEEDED IN ASSASSINATING TUNISIA'S STOCKY

CHIEFTAIN . THE PLOTTERS ACTUALLY MADE TWO ATTEMPTS ON BOURGUIBA'S LIFE

. THE FIRST TRY FAILED ON DEC . 15 BECAUSE BOURGUIBA DID NOT SPEND THE

NIGHT AT HIS PRESIDENTIAL PALACE AT CARTHAGE, NEAR TUNIS . THE PLOTTERS

NEXT LAID THEIR PLANS FOR MIDNIGHT, DEC . 21, AND EVEN BOURGUIBA'S

PERSONAL BODYGUARD AGREED TO LEAD THE KILLERS TO THE PRESIDENT'S

BEDSIDE . NO REPLACEMENT . A FEW HOURS BEFORE MIDNIGHT, A TUNISIAN ARMY

NON-COM BURST IN UPON A DEFENSE MINISTRY OFFICIAL AND BLURTED THE

DETAILS OF THE PLOT . THAT NIGHT, AND ON FOLLOWING DAYS, MORE THAN A

HUNDRED PLOTTERS WERE JAILED . THEY PROVED TO BE A HANDFUL OF DISSIDENT

ARMY OFFICERS AND SOME DISGRUNTLED LANDOWNERS . BUT THE HARD CORE

SEEMED TO BE SUPPORTERS OF BOURGUIBA'S OLD FOE, THE LATE SALAH BEN

YOUSSEF, WHO LOST A BITTER STRUGGLE FOR CONTROL OF NEO-DESTOUR,

TUNISIA'S ONLY POLITICAL PARTY, AND WENT INTO EXILE IN 1955 . WHEN BEN

YOUSSEF WAS MURDERED IN WEST GERMANY IN 1961 HIS FOLLOWERS BACK HOME

BLAMED BOURGUIBA AGENTS, SWORE VENGEANCE ON TUNISIA'S BOSS HIMSELF .

THE PLOTTERS' ONLY PLAN, APPARENTLY, WAS TO SLAY THE PRESIDENT . SAID

BOURGUIBA : " AFTER MY DEATH THE COUNTRY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A STATE OF

TOTAL ANARCHY . THE PLOTTERS THOUGHT ONLY OF ELIMINATING ME, NOT

REPLACING ME . " CROWDS GATHERED TO HEAR OFFICIAL SPEECHES OF

INDIGNATION AT THE ATTEMPT ON BOURGUIBA'S LIFE . THERE SEEMED LITTLE

DOUBT THAT HE STILL HELD THE NATION'S BASIC LOYALTY, BUT EVEN HIS

CLOSEST FRIENDS WERE CONCERNED AT THE RECENT SIGNS OF UNREST CAUSED BY

THREE SUCCESSIVE YEARS OF DROUGHT AND AN UNEMPLOYMENT LEVEL OF 400,000

OUT OF A POPULATIONS OF 4,000,000 . BOURGUIBA IS ALSO AWARE OF THE

MUTTERING OF MANY ABOUT THE THREE EXPENSIVE NEW PALACES HE HAS RECENTLY

BUILT . THESE " BELONG TO THE STATE, " HE RETORTED IN HIS " I AM ALIVE

/ SPEECH . HE ADDED WITH SOME BITTERNESS : " THERE IS A TENDENCY TO

FORGET THAT I SPENT 30 YEARS IN FRENCH JAILS FOR MY COUNTRY . " KNOCKED

HEADS . IN HIS EFFORTS TO RESHAPE TUNISIA AS A MODERN NATION, BOURGUIBA

HAS HAD TO KNOCK HEADS TOGETHER . INEVITABLY, SOME ARMY OFFICERS RESENT

THE BACKSEAT ROLE HE GIVES THE MILITARY . AND MOSLEM RELIGIOUS LEADERS

ARE ANGERED BY HIS ATTEMPT TO ABOLISH THE DAY-LONG FASTS OF THE MONTH

OF RAMADAN, AND BY HIS EMANCIPATION OF WOMEN . A U.S .INVESTIGATING

COMMITTEE IN 1961 AGREED THAT BOURGUIBA WAS MAKING THE RIGHT MOVES TO

SOLVE TUNIS'S ECONOMIC ILLS, BUT WARNED THAT HE MIGHT BE ASKING TOO

GREAT SACRIFICES OF HIS PEOPLE . AFTER LAST WEEK'S BRUSH WITH DEATH,

BOURGUIBA MAY GO FORWARD A BIT MORE SLOWLY, AND CAN UNDOUBTEDLY DRAW

SOME SUPPORT FROM THE FACT THAT LAST MONTH THE U.S . FINALLY AGREED TO

GRANT TUNISIA $180 MILLION IN ECONOMIC AID OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS .

KASHMIR TALKING AT LAST THE BRITISH RAJ, WHICH ONCE

CONTROLLED INDIA'S NORTHWEST FRONTIER PROVINCE OF KASHMIR, EXACTED A

TOKEN ANNUAL TRIBUTE OF TWO KASHMIRI SHAWLS AND THREE HANDKERCHIEFS

FROM THE MAHARAJAH . NEVER SINCE HAS THE PRICE OF PEACE BEEN AS SMALL .

IN THE YEARS AFTER INDEPENDENCE IN 1947 SPLIT THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT

INTO THE SOVEREIGN STATES OF INDIA AND PAKISTAN, THE TWO NATIONS HAVE

PAID WITH STRIFE AND BLOODSHED TO ESTABLISH THEIR CONFLICTING CLAIMS

OVER THE DISPUTED REGION . LAST WEEK, AFTER 15 YEARS OF BITTER

WRANGLING, INDIAN AND PAKISTANI DELEGATES FINALLY MET IN THE PAKISTAN

CAPITAL OF RAWALPINDI TO SEEK A SOLUTION TO THE KASHMIR PROBLEM . THE

DISPUTED LAND IS THE SIZE OF MINNESOTA, LAKES AND ALL . IT FALLS FROM

THE WINDWHIPPED MOUNTAINS OF GILGIT AND LADAKH IN THE NORTH TO THE

IDYLLIC VALE OF KASHMIR . IN THE HIMALAYAS, PRIMITIVE MOUNTAIN

TRIBESMEN KEEP HERDS OF GRACEFUL, SURE-FOOTED KASHMIR GOATS, WHOSE SOFT

FLEECE BECOMES THE CASHMERE OF FIFTH AVENUE AND REGENT STREET ; THE

COOL LAKES NEAR KASHMIR'S CAPITAL CITY OF SRINAGAR ARE DOTTED WITH THE

ELEGANT HOUSEBOATS OF WEALTHY INDIANS . VOW FORGOTTEN . AT THE TIME OF

PARTITION, KASHMIR, LIKE ALL OF INDIA'S 562 PRINCELY STATES, WAS GIVEN

THE CHOICE OF JOINING EITHER PAKISTAN OR INDIA . THE FACT THAT 77 PER

CENT OF KASHMIR'S 4,200,000 PEOPLE WERE MOSLEM POINTED TO CONTROL BY

MOSLEM PAKISTAN . BUT THOUGH HE HAD SIGNED PRELIMINARY TRADE AND

ADMINISTRATIVE AGREEMENTS WITH PAKISTAN, KASHMIR'S HINDU MAHARAJAH

BEGAN TO HEDGE . ANGERED BY HIS FAILURE TO ACCEDE TO PAKISTAN, HORDES

OF PAKISTANI " VOLUNTEERS " SWEPT INTO KASHMIR TO ESTABLISH PAKISTAN'S

CLAIM TO THE LAND . IN TERROR, THE HINDU RULER OPTED TO JOIN INDIA,

APPEALED FOR IMMEDIATE MILITARY AID . INDIA WAS HAPPY TO RESPOND,

AIRLIFTED TROOPS INTO KASHMIR TO FORTIFY ITS OWN CLAIM . THUS BEGAN A

FULL-SCALE WAR IN KASHMIR . INDIA WENT TO THE UNITED NATIONS FOR RELIEF

. IN 1949 THE U.N . DEMARCATED A CEASE-FIRE LINE THAT GAVE INDIA THE

RICHEST TWO-THIRDS OF KASHMIR, INCLUDING MOST OF LADAKH, THE VALE, AND

THE PREDOMINANTLY HINDU AREA OF JAMMU . BUT INDIA'S PRIME MINISTER

JAWAHARLAL NEHRU HAD PLEDGED THAT " THE FATE OF KASHMIR MUST ULTIMATELY

BE DECIDED BY ITS PEOPLE . " DECLARED NEHRU : " WE ARE PREPARED, WHEN

PEACE, LAW AND ORDER HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED, TO HAVE A REFERENDUM UNDER

SOME INTERNATIONAL AUSPICES LIKE THE U.N . " NEHRU SOON FORGOT THAT

VOW, FOR IT BECAME OBVIOUS THAT KASHMIR WOULD VOTE EITHER FOR

INDEPENDENCE OR ACCESSION TO PAKISTAN . INDIAN KASHMIR'S MOSLEM RULER,

SHEIK MOHAMMED ABDULLAH, AN OLD FRIEND OF NEHRU'S AND A FIERY KASHMIRI

NATIONALIST, CONFUSED THINGS BY STARTING TO PROMOTE A LOCAL

INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT . INDIA CLAPPED SHEIK ABDULLAH INTO JAIL IN 1953

AND INTRODUCED A SERIES OF REPRESSIVE MEASURES TO HALT OTHER

NATIONALIST OR PROPAKISTAN MOVEMENTS . EXCEPT FOR THREE MONTHS IN 1958,

SHEIK ABDULLAH HAS LANGUISHED IN PRISON EVER SINCE, WAS LAST WEEK ON

TRIAL ON CHARGES OF CONSPIRACY TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT . NUDGE FROM

THE NORTH . THE IMPRISONMENT OF SHEIK ABDULLAH SYMBOLIZED ALL OF

PAKISTAN'S DEEP DISTRUST OF NEHRU . DESPITE HIS OUTWARD DEVOTION TO THE

U.N., NO AMOUNT OF U.N . PRESSURE COULD BRING NEHRU TO THE BARGAINING

TABLE WITH PAKISTAN OVER KASHMIR . BUT WHEN RED CHINA THRUST DEEP INTO

INDIA'S HIMALAYAN BORDERLAND LAST OCTOBER, NEHRU RELUCTANTLY YIELDED TO

THE INSISTENT ENVOYS OF THE U.S . AND BRITAIN WHO SUGGESTED THAT UNLESS

INDIA AND PAKISTAN SETTLED THEIR DIFFERENCES, THERE WOULD BE LITTLE

HOPE OF DEFENDING THE SUBCONTINENT AGAINST CHINESE AGGRESSION .

HOTHEADED EXTREMISTS IN BOTH COUNTRIES OPPOSED THE IDEA OF TALKS .

KASHMIR IS NOT FOR SALE, SCREAMED AN INDIAN HEADLINE ; IN PAKISTAN'S

NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, POLITICIANS ARGUED THAT COMMUNISM WAS FAR LESS AN

EVIL THAN " HINDU DOMINATION . " WHERE WAS THE ROOM FOR NEGOTIATION ?

OFFICIALLY PAKISTAN MAINTAINED THAT AN OVERALL PLEBISCITE IS THE ONLY

SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM . BUT PRIVATELY PAKISTAN HAS FALLBACK

POSITIONS, IS WILLING TO HOLD REGIONAL REFERENDUMS THAT WOULD GIVE

INDIA BOTH JAMMU AND LADAKH . THE REAL ISSUE, HOWEVER, WAS KASHMIR'S

VALE . PAKISTAN SEEMED AGREEABLE TO THE INTERNATIONALIZATION OF THE

IMPORTANT REGION . NEHRU, HOWEVER, FEARED THAT SECESSION OF ANY PART OF

KASHMIR WOULD ENCOURAGE SEPARATIST MOVEMENTS IN OTHER INDIAN STATES

WITH STRONG NATIONALIST TENDENCIES . NEVERTHELESS, INDIAN OFFICIALS

SHOWED UP IN RAWALPINDI FOR THE START OF NEGOTIATIONS LAST WEEK . THEY

WERE PREPARED FOR ALMOST ANY SURPRISE BUT THE ONE THAT ACTUALLY ARRIVED

. ON THE EVE OF THE CONFERENCE, PAKISTAN SUDDENLY ANNOUNCED AN

AGREEMENT " IN PRINCIPLE " WITH RED CHINA FOR A COMPLETE SETTLEMENT OF

THEIR MUTUAL BORDER DIFFERENCES . TO THE INDIANS IT WAS A STUNNING

BLOW, FOR IT SEEMED THAT THE PAKISTANIS WERE DELIBERATELY USING THE

CHINESE BOGEYMAN TO BLACKMAIL THEM INTO YIELDING BETTER TERMS ON THE

KASHMIR QUESTION . AFTER TWO DAYS OF NO PROGRESS, THE RAWALPINDI TALKS

WERE ADJOURNED FOR THREE WEEKS .

EXACTLY SINCE THE LAST BRITISH SOLDIER LEFT SUEZ . THERE TO CELEBRATE

THE OCCASION WAS EGYPT'S PRESIDENT GAMAL ABDEL NASSER . AS 20,000

EGYPTIANS CHEERED, NASSER CALLED THE BRITISH FROM QUEEN TO COMMONOR "

SONS OF BITCHES, " SNEERED AT HIS CRITICS, AND RIDICULED AS A PAIR OF "

NUTS " JORDAN'S KING HUSSEIN AND SAUDI ARABIA'S KING SAUD BECAUSE THEY

OPPOSE EGYPT'S MILITARY VENTURE IN YEMEN, WHERE NASSER SUPPORTS THE

REBEL ABDULLAH SALLAL . " BROTHERS ! " CRIED NASSER . " THIS IS NOT

THE YEMENI PEOPLE'S BATTLE . IT IS OUR BATTLE, BECAUSE THE MORE PEOPLE

WE CAN WIN OVER FROM IMPERIALISM AND REACTION, THE MORE OUR POWER IS

INCREASED . REVOLUTION WILL SOON TRIUMPH EVERYWHERE AGAINST REACTION

! " NASSER PROMISED THAT ISRAEL'S TURN WOULD COME AS SOON AS " WE GET

RID OF SAUD AND HUSSEIN, WHO CONSPIRE WITH ZIONISM AND IMPERIALISM TO

PRESERVE THEIR OWN THRONES AND FORTUNES . NASSER PROUDLY WATCHED A

PARADE OF EGYPTIAN MIGHT 60 NEW SOVIET-BUILT 5-54 TANKS, ANTIAIRCRAFT

DETACHMENTS, BATTERIES OF TACTICAL ROCKETS, AND DISMISSED REPORTS THAT

MORE THAN 10,000 EGYPTIANS HAD BEEN LOST IN THE YEMEN CAMPAIGN,

INSISTED THAT THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF EGYPTIAN DEAD WAS ONLY 136 .

WASHINGTON WAS WRONG IF IT THOUGHT THAT NASSER WOULD WITHDRAW EGYPTIAN

FORCES AND LEAVE THE AREA IN PEACE IN EXCHANGE FOR U.S . DIPLOMATIC

RECOGNITION OF YEMEN'S REVOLUTIONARY REGIME . INSTEAD, NASSER MADE IT

CLEAR AT PORT SAID THAT HE PLANS TO STAY IN YEMEN, THE BETTER TO EXPORT

REVOLUTION INTO THE BRITISH-PROTECTED STATES RANGING FROM KUWAIT IN THE

NORTH OF THE ARABIAN PENINSULA TO ADEN IN THE SOUTH AS WELL AS TO

THE CONGO THE U.N . DRIVES IMPLACABLY AHEAD BELGIAN

CEMENT WORKER ALBERT VERBRUGGHE WAS DRIVING HIS WIFE AND ANOTHER WOMAN

DOWN A QUIET STREET IN THE COPPER TOWN OF JADOTVILLE ONE DAY LAST WEEK,

WHEN HE SUDDENLY HEARD THE CLATTER OF GUNFIRE . PULLING THE TRIGGERS

FOR NO APPARENT REASON WERE NERVOUS INDIAN TROOPS OF THE ADVANCING

UNITED NATIONS FORCE . VERBRUGGHE SLAMMED HIS LITTLE VOLKSWAGEN TO A

HALT . HIS WIFE WAS ALREADY DEAD, THE OTHER WOMAN DYING . WITH AN

ANGUISHED SCREAM, VERBRUGGHE STUMBLED OUT, BLOOD STREAMING FROM A WOUND

UNDER HIS EYE . " MY WIFE IS KILLED, " HE CRIED . " WHY, WHY, WHY ? "

THE SAME QUESTION, IN A LARGER CONTEXT, WAS BEING ASKED IN MANY

CAPITALS LAST WEEK . FOR THE THIRD TIME IN 15 MONTHS, THE WORLD WAS

HORRIFIED WITNESS TO THE SPECTACLE OF FOREIGN SOLDIERS, AIDED BY THE

U.S., SEIZING THE TOWNS AND FIRING ON NATIVE SOLDIERS OF THE CONGO . TO

MANY, THE U.N.'S VERY PRESENCE IN THE AFRICAN LAND WAS OF DOUBTFUL

WISDOM . BUT IN ANY CASE, THE BLAZING GUNS AND SWOOPING PLANES OF THE

U.N . HARDLY FITTED THE PACIFYING INTENT OF ITS ORIGINAL CONGO MANDATE

. " IT IS AN UNSPEAKABLE TRAGEDY, " SAID CONNECTICUT'S DEMOCRATIC

SENATOR THOMAS DODD, " THAT THE WORLD ORGANIZATION WHICH WAS SET UP TO

PREVENT WAR AND PRESERVE THE PEACE SHOULD BE STARTING WARS . " IN

LONDON, 90 TORY M.P.S ACCUSED THE U.N . OF ACTING " CONTRARY TO ITS OWN

CHARTER . " EVEN PRESIDENT KENNEDY, WHO LAST WEEK ORDERED THE U.S . TO

BEGIN SHIPPING 2F-TON TRUCKS, ARMORED CARS AND TRANSPORT PLANES TO THE

U.N . CONGO FORCE, WAS REPORTED TO BE ALARMED AT THE DISORDER THAT

AROSE FROM THE U.N . SHOOTING . ON TO JADOTVILLE . BUT THERE WAS NO

TURNING BACK ON THE BASIC DECISION THAT HAD BEEN MADE . KATANGA'S

SECESSIONIST PRESIDENT MOISE TSHOMBE HAD USED EVERY SLY TRICK IN THE

BOOK TO FRUSTRATE EFFORTS TO REUNITE HIS REBELLIOUS,

COPPERRICH PROVINCE WITH THE REST OF THE CONGO . NOW, U.N .

SECRETARY-GENERAL U THANT, WITH U.S . ENCOURAGEMENT, WAS DETERMINED TO

END THE KATANGA PROBLEM ONCE AND FOR ALL . THE OCCASION HAPPENED TO BE

THE COLLAPSE OF DISCIPLINE AMONG TSHOMBE'S BOOZY, RAGTAG 20,000-MAN

GENDARMERIE . WHEN THEY BEGAN SHOOTING AT U.N . SOLDIERS IN KATANGA A

FORTNIGHT AGO, THE U.N . REPLIED WITH ALL THE POWER AT ITS COMMAND .

LAST WEEK IRISH INFANTRYMEN MARCHED INTO KIPUSHI, SITE OF COPPER MINES

AT THE RHODESIAN BORDER . ETHIOPIAN U.N TROOPS ALREADY OCCUPIED

ELISABETHVILLE ITSELF . BUT THE BIG PRIZE WAS JADOTVILLE, A TOWN OF

90,000, WHERE THE GIANT UNION MINIERE MINERAL

OUTFIT PRODUCES ONE-THIRD OF ITS COPPER (110,000 TONS) AND

THREE-FOURTHS OF ITS COBALT (6,600 TONS) EACH YEAR . TOWARD JADOTVILLE,

70 MILES FROM ELISABETHVILLE, MOVED A TWO-MILE-LONG COLUMN OF INDIANS

COMMANDED BY BRIGADIER REGINALD NORONHA, A GUTTY SOLDIER WHO MUNCHED

HARDBOILED EGGS WHILE MORTAR SHELLS BURST AROUND HIM . WEAPONS AFLOAT .

BRITAIN AND BELGIUM HAD HEAVY INVESTMENTS, BRITISH U.N . AMBASSADOR SIR

PATRICK DEAN AND BELGIUM'S WALTER LORIDAN DEMANDED ASSURANCES FROM

THANT THAT THE U.N . FORCES WOULD GO NO FARTHER . THANT ASSURED THEM

THAT THEY HAD HALTED AT THE LUFIRA RIVER . THAT WAS CORRECT, UP TO A

POINT . WITH THREE BRIDGES DOWN, THE INDIANS STOPPED AT THE LUFIRA ALL

RIGHT, BUT ONLY LONG ENOUGH TO RIG ROPES AND PULLEYS TO A SWIMMING

FLOAT AND FERRY 120-MM . MORTARS, RECOILLESS RIFLES AND JEEPS ACROSS

HE HAD NO ORDERS NOT TO SO HE KEPT ON GOING . UNOPPOSED, THE INDIANS

TROOPED INTO JADOTVILLE WITH NORONHA HIMSELF HEADING

HELICOPTER HAS REVOLUTIONIZED THE UGLY LITTLE ANTI-COMMUNIST WAR IN

SOUTH VIET NAM . USING THE WHIRLYBIRDS FOR TRANSPORT, GOVERNMENT FORCES

NO LONGER REMAIN IMMOBILE IN FIXED OUTPOSTS . THEY NOW GO WHERE THE

VIET CONG GOES . SOMETIMES THIS IS NOT VERY HEALTHY, FOR THE RED

GUERRILLAS HAVE DEVELOPED TACTICS TO COUNTER THE COPTERS . IN THE EARLY

DAYS, THEY TRIED TO SHOOT THEM DOWN WITH HOMEMADE SHOTGUNS AND ANCIENT

FRENCH RIFLES ; ONE HELICOPTER EVEN RETURNED TO BASE WITH AN ARROW

STUCK IN ITS FUSELAGE . TODAY, WITH MORE PRACTICE AND AN ABUNDANT

SUPPLY OF CAPTURED U.S . WEAPONS, THE VIET CONG GANGMEN CAN MAKE THINGS

HOT FOR THE MOST SKILLED U.S . HELICOPTER PILOT . LAST WEEK THE VIET

CONG FORCES PROVED THEIR PROWESS BY SHOOTING DOWN FIVE HELICOPTERS OVER

RICE MARSHES SOUTHWEST OF SAIGON AND INFLICTING A BRUTAL DEFEAT ON THE

GOVERNMENT FORCES . LIKE SHOOTING DUCKS . THE BATTLE BEGAN AS A ROUTINE

CHOPPERS, TO FERRY 400 GOVERNMENT TROOPS TO THE DROP ZONE IN WAVES OF

100 MEN EACH . THE FIRST THREE GROUPS LANDED WITH NO GROUND FIRE FROM

THE ENEMY . BUT AS THE FOURTH LIFT FLUTTERED OVER THE PADDIES, THE

COMMUNISTS LET LOOSE WITH A BLAZE OF BULLETS FROM THE WOODS AT THE EDGE

OF THE RICE FIELD . " THE TREE LINE SEEMED TO EXPLODE WITH MACHINE-GUN

FIRE, " SAID ONE HELICOPTER PILOT . " IT WAS PURE HELL . " VIRTUALLY

MOTIONLESS, THE BANANA-SHAPED HELICOPTERS WERE HELPLESS TARGETS AT

POINT-BLANK RANGE ; FIVE OF THE HOVERING CHOPPERS WERE SHOT DOWN, AND

NINE OTHERS WERE RIDDLED BY ENEMY FIRE . ON THE GROUND, THE GOVERNMENT

FORCES WERE PINNED DOWN IN THE HAIL OF FIRE . " WHEN THOSE POOR

VIETNAMESE CAME OUT OF THE CHOPPERS, IT WAS LIKE SHOOTING DUCKS FOR THE

VIET CONG, " SAID ONE U.S . OFFICER . THE STUNNED SURVIVORS BURROWED

INTO THE SLIMY MUD OF THE PADDIES AND STAYED THERE, REFUSING TO

CONTINUE THE ASSAULT . DESPERATELY CAPTAIN KENNETH GOOD, 32, A WEST

POINTER FROM EWA BEACH, HAWAII, SOUGHT TO RALLY THE VIETNAMESE FOR A

COUNTERATTACK, BUT HE WAS STITCHED THROUGH THE NECK AND CHEST BY A

BURST FROM A VIET CONG AUTOMATIC RIFLE . THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS STAYED

PUT . AFTER EIGHT HOURS OF CONTINUOUS BOMBARDMENT, REINFORCEMENTS BEGAN

TO ARRIVE . BLASTING AWAY WITH MACHINE GUNS, GOVERNMENT ARMORED CARS

REPEATEDLY ATTACKED THE ENTRENCHED VIET CONG POSITIONS AT THE TREE LINE

AND ALONG A CANAL BORDERING THE PADDIES ; EACH TIME THEY WERE DRIVEN

BACK . OVERHEAD, GOVERNMENT PLANES POUNDED THE VIET CONG WITH BOMBS AND

NAPALM, BUT THE COMMUNISTS DID NOT BREAK . " MY GOD, WE GOT A FIX ON

ONE MACHINE-GUN POSITION AND MADE 15 AERIAL RUNS ON IT, " SAID A U.S .

ADVISER . " EVERY TIME WE THOUGHT WE HAD HIM, AND EVERY TIME THAT

DAMNED GUNNER CAME RIGHT BACK UP, FIRING . " THE OPEN WALLET . AS DUSK

FELL, THE VIET CONG SLIPPED INTO SAMPANS AND ESCAPED DOWN THE DARKENED

CANAL WITH THEIR DEAD AND WOUNDED . " EVERYTHING WE DID WENT WRONG, "

COMPLAINED A U.S . ADVISER . A BATTALION OF GOVERNMENT PARATROOPERS,

ASSIGNED THE JOB OF BLOCKING THE REDS' ESCAPE ROUTE, WAS AIRDROPPED

INTO THE WRONG POSITION . AND WHEN GOVERNMENT ARTILLERY AT LAST STARTED

TO SHELL THE WOODED VIET CONG POSITIONS, THEIR ROUNDS WERE ZEROED IN ON

THEIR OWN TROOPS, KILLED THREE OF THEIR OWN MEN . WORST OF ALL, THE

BATTERED VIETNAMESE TROOPS SHOWED LITTLE INTEREST IN PURSUING THE REDS

. INSTEAD, THEY SLOSHED THROUGH THE PADDYFIELDS, PICKING UP THEIR

CASUALTIES 68 DEAD AND 100 WOUNDED AND POKING THROUGH THE DOWNED

HELICOPTERS . ON THE CABIN FLOOR OF ONE OF THE CHOPPERS LAY THE WALLET

OF A DEAD U.S . ADVISER OPEN TO A PICTURE OF HIS WIFE AND CHILD . IN

ALL, THREE U.S . ADVISERS CAPTAIN GOOD, SERGEANT WILLIAM DEAL OF MAYS

LANDING, N.J., AND SPECIALIST 4 DONALD BRAMAN OF RADCLIFF, KY . WERE

KILLED IN THE AMBUSH, AND SIX MORE WOUNDED . THE DEAD BROUGHT TO 56 THE

NUMBER OF U.S . TROOPS KILLED SO FAR IN SOUTH VIET NAM . PIECEMEALED TO

DEATH . THE EXTENT OF THE GOVERNMENT DEFEAT UNDER CONDITIONS OF ITS OWN

CHOOSING AND THE HEAVY LOSSES SUFFERED BY THE U.S . HELICOPTERS CAUSED

HEADS TO SNAP FROM SAIGON TO WASHINGTON . UNDER ORDERS FROM PRESIDENT

KENNEDY, THE PENTAGON BEGAN TO INVESTIGATE WAYS IN WHICH THE CHOPPERS

CAN BE BETTER PROTECTED . IN SAIGON, U.S . ADVISERS ADMITTED THAT THE

DAY WAS A " MISERABLE PERFORMANCE, " BLAMED THE DEFEAT ON A " LACK OF

AGGRESSIVENESS " BY GOVERNMENT TROOPS . " THEY MOVED IN SLOWLY AND GAVE

THE VIET CONG A CHANCE TO PIECEMEAL THEM TO DEATH, " SAID ONE AMERICAN

OFFICER . STILL, U.S . ADVISERS ARE PLEASED WITH THE PROGRESS MADE BY

GOVERNMENT TROOPS OVER THE PAST YEAR . " CASUALTIES ARE INEVITABLE WHEN

YOU ARE FIGHTING A WAR, " SAID ONE . " THE VIET CONG ARE IMPROVING

PARTY AND A MARTIAL RENDITION OF THE FALANGIST ANTHEM . LAST WEEK, FOR

THE FIRST TIME, NEWS BULLETINS ENDED INSTEAD WITH A PLEASANT FEMININE

VOICE BIDDING SENORES Y SENORAS GOOD DAY, FOLLOWED BY A FEW BARS OF A

CATCH PASO DOBLE . IN SLOW-MOVING SPAIN, CHANGE OF ANY KIND IS RARE AND

RELUCTANT . YET, ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLY THE REGIME IS BEGINNING TO RELAX

ITS IRON GRIP ON SOCIETY . SINCE HIS APPOINTMENT AS FRANCO'S

INFORMATION MINISTER LAST JULY, MANUEL FRAGA IRIBARNE, 40, HAS BOOSTED

THE DAILY RATION OF RADIO NEWS FROM FOUR TO 18 BROADCASTS A DAY AND FOR

THE FIRST TIME ALLOWED SPANISH LISTENERS A COMPARATIVELY BROAD SAMPLING

OF WORLD EVENTS . TALE OF PASIONARIA . PRESS CENSORSHIP ALSO HAS

MELLOWED MARKEDLY . NEWSPAPERS ARE NO LONGER GIVEN THE OLD-STYLE DAILY

INSTRUCCIONES THAT LAID DOWN WHAT STORIES THEY COULD RUN AND EVEN

DICTATED HOW THEY SHOULD BE LAID OUT . THOUGH THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST

DAILIES IN MADRID AND BARCELONA ARE STILL SUBJECT TO CENSORSHIP, ONLY

15 STORIES HAVE BEEN DOCTORED BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS SINCE FRAGA TOOK

OVER, AND NO FOREIGN PUBLICATIONS HAVE BEEN SEIZED FOR POLITICAL

REASONS. IN OTHER CITIES, PAPERS NO LONGER ARE REQUIRED TO SHOW GALLEY

PROOFS TO THE CENSORS BEFORE GOING TO PRESS . ONE WEEKLY IS ACTUALLY

SERIALIZING THE MEMOIRS OF DOLORES IBARRURI, THE FABLED LA PASIONARIA

OF CIVIL WAR DAYS, WHO IS QUEEN BEE OF SPAIN'S EXILED COMMUNIST PARTY

EIGHT PROMINENT INTELLECTUALS ARRESTED LAST YEAR AFTER DENOUNCING

FRANCO AT A MUNICH CONFERENCE, FIVE HAVE BEEN PARDONED AND THE REST

ALLOWED TO GO INTO VOLUNTARY EXILE . FRANCO'S UNIFORMED STATE POLICE,

ONCE EVERYWHERE, IS NOW LESS OBVIOUS, LESS ARROGANT . GIFT FOR

ONE-FIFTH . FRANCO'S DECISION TO END SPAIN'S LONG CULTURAL AND

POLITICAL ISOLATION IS BASED ON HIS TWOFOLD CONVICTION THAT 1) THE

POPULACE AS A WHOLE NOW ACCEPTS HIS REGIME, AND 2) SPAIN CANNOT SURVIVE

ECONOMICALLY IF IT IS EXCLUDED FROM THE EUROPEAN COMMON MARKET, WHOSE

MEMBERS BITTERLY DISLIKE HIS AUTOCRATIC WAYS . THE STUBBORN ILLEGAL

STRIKES THAT CRIPPLED SPAIN'S ECONOMY FOR TWO MONTHS LAST YEAR ALSO

FORCED EL CAUDILLO TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE COUNTRY'S HARDPRESSED WORKERS

ARE DESPERATELY EAGER TO ENJOY LIVING STANDARDS COMPARABLE TO THOSE OF

OTHER EUROPEANS . AS A GIFT TO THE HOPELESSLY POOR UNSKILLED LABORERS

WHO MAKE UP ONE-FIFTH OF THE WORK FORCE, FRANCO LAST WEEK ANNOUNCED AN

INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE THAT WILL ALMOST DOUBLE THEIR TAKEHOME PAY

AND FRINGE BENEFITS (TO $1.66 A DAY) . SPAIN, SAID FRANCO, IN A

YEAR-END TV AND RADIO ADDRESS, IS NOW " A NATION OF PEACE, ON THE ROAD

TO ECONOMIC RECUPERATION, WITH A CAPACITY FOR GROWTH IN ALL SECTORS OF

ITS LIFE, AND WITH A YOUTH THAT IS TECHNICALLY PREPARED AND EAGER TO

FACE THE FUTURE . TIME ALONE WAS BANNED OR SEIZED 54 TIMES IN

GREAT BRITAIN THE FATEFUL WEEKS TO

CELEBRATE HIS SIXTH FULL YEAR IN OFFICE THE LONGEST TERM FOR A TORY

SINCE 1902 PRIME MINISTER HAROLD MACMILLAN WENT BEFORE THE CAMERAS FOR

A TELEVISION INTERVIEW LAST WEEK . IT WAS A MASTERFUL PERFORMANCE .

RELAXED AND CONFIDENT, MACMILLAN TALKED WITH EASY CONFIDENCE OF THE

PROMISE AND PROBLEMS OF BRITAIN TODAY . OFF-CAMERA, THINGS WERE NOT

GOING SO WELL AS HAROLD MACMILLAN MADE IT SEEM . BRITAIN'S HOPES OF

MEMBERSHIP IN THE COMMON MARKET HUNG PRECARIOUSLY IN THE BALANCE .

AFTER THE DECISIONS AT NASSAU, A QUESTION MARK ROSE OVER THE FUTURE OF

ITS MILITARY POWER . THE LATEST GALLUP POLL SHOWED LABOR LEADING THE

TORIES 45 PER CENT TO 36 PER CENT . MANY OF MACMILLAN'S OWN

CONSERVATIVE PARTY BACKBENCHERS WERE CRITICAL OF THE GOVERNMENT FOR ITS

INABILITY TO STOP THE GROWING UNEMPLOYMENT IN BRITAIN'S NORTH .

REASON FOR CONFIDENCE . SEEKING A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF

JOBS, MACMILLAN LAST WEEK GAVE LORD HAILSHAM A NEW MINISTERIAL TASK OF

STUDYING THE NORTHEAST DEPRESSED AREAS, AND TOLD BIRMINGHAM BUSINESSMEN

THAT " WITH A LITTLE BIT OF LUCK " THE ECONOMIC SLUMP MIGHT BE REVERSED

THIS YEAR . AS ANOTHER WEAPON AGAINST POLITICAL DECLINE, MACMILLAN IS

CLEARLY COUNTING ON ADMISSION TO THE COMMON MARKET DESPITE THE

OVERWHELMING OBSTACLES AHEAD . ON TV HE SAID : " I BELIEVE THAT AS

SOON AS THE COMMON MARKET IS SETTLED, AND AS SOON AS IT IS CLEAR THAT

THERE WILL NOT BE ANOTHER SOCIALIST GOVERNMENT, YOU WILL FIND THE

BUSINESSMEN REINVESTING ON A BIGGER SCALE THAN EVER BEFORE . THAT IS

WHY I AM CONFIDENT ABOUT 1963 . " A DECISION ON COMMON MARKET ENTRY MAY

BE IMMINENT . THIS WEEK BRITAIN'S CHIEF NEGOTIATOR EDWARD HEATH RETURNS

TO BRUSSELS FOR A CRUCIAL ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH EUROPE'S SIX THE "

CRUNCH " TALKS IN WHICH BRITAIN WILL HAVE TO AGREE TO . WHEN LORD

SALISBURY RESIGNED AFTER A SEVEN YEAR TERM .

DISMANTLE ITS OWN ELABORATE SYSTEM OR PERSUADE

THE EUROPEANS TO EASE THEIR

TERMS FOR ENTRY . SEEKING SUPPORT . IN PREPARATION FOR THE BRUSSELS

MEETING, TED HEATH WENT TO CHEQUERS, MACMILLAN'S MINISTERIAL ESTATE,

SPENT HOURS URGING HIS VIEWS ON WEST GERMANY'S VISITING FOREIGN

MINISTER GERHARD SCHRODER, A CONSIDERABLE SYMPATHIZER . THEN HEATH

CROSSED TO THE CONTINENT TO LINE UP ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR BRITAIN'S

POSITION . HE TALKED WITH BELGIUM'S DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER HENRI

FAYAT, WHO WANTS BRITAIN IN THE COMMON MARKET, AND WITH FRANCE'S

FOREIGN MINISTER MAURICE COUVE DE MURVILLE, WHO FAITHFULLY ECHOED DE

GAULLE'S RELUCTANCE TO LOWER THE BARS FOR BRITAIN . MACMILLAN HIMSELF

WILL CONTINUE THE TASK ON HIS FEB . 1 VISIT TO ROME FOR MEETINGS WITH

ITALY'S PRIME MINISTER AMINTORE FANFANI, DUE THIS WEEK IN WASHINGTON .

AS FATE WOULD HAVE IT, THE TORIES WON RELIEF OF SORTS FROM THE DRUMFIRE

OF CRITICISM AT HOME THROUGH A TRAGIC HAPPENSTANCE IN THE LABOR PARTY .

HUGH GAITSKELL, LABOR'S CAPABLE, HARD-WORKING LEADER, WAS RUSHED TO

LONDON'S MIDDLESEX HOSPITAL SUFFERING FROM PNEUMONIA, DOUBLE PLEURISY

AND SEVERE PERIOCARDITIS . IN GREAT PAIN AND SCARCELY ABLE TO BREATHE,

GAITSKELL WAS ALLOWED NO VISITORS EXCEPT HIS WIFE . SNAP PRESSURE .

LABOR SPOKESMEN OFFICIALLY SPREAD THE NEWS THAT GAITSKELL WOULD BE BACK

AT WORK WITHIN FIVE TO SIX WEEKS, BUT MEDICAL MEN THOUGHT THREE TO SIX

MONTHS MORE LIKELY . THIS MEANS HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO LEAD LABOR'S

ATTACK ON BRITAIN'S COMMON MARKET ENTRY . IN FACT, TO LABOR'S ACUTE

EMBARRASSMENT, THE MAN WHO BECOMES SPOKESMAN IN GAITSKELL'S PLACE IS

DEPUTY LEADER GEORGE BROWN, WHO IS AS PRO-COMMON MARKET AS GAITSKELL AS

ANTI . THE CONSERVATIVE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH PAID TRIBUTE TO GAITSKELL BY

SUGGESTING THAT " WITHOUT HIM, THERE CAN BE NO

ALTERNATIVE GOVERNMENT WORTH THE NAME . " SOME TORIES PROMPTLY URGED

MACMILLAN TO CALL A SNAP GENERAL ELECTION WHILE LABOR IS VIRTUALLY

LEADERLESS . BUT MACMILLAN WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY RESIST THE PRESSURE,

SELECT HIS OWN TIME BETWEEN NOW AND OCTOBER 1964, THE DATE BY WHICH A

GENERAL ELECTION MUST BE HELD . IF, DURING THE " CRUNCH " OF THE NEXT

FEW WEEKS IN BRUSSELS, BRITAIN IS ADMITTED TO THE COMMON MARKET ON AN

APPROXIMATION OF ITS OWN TERMS, AND IF THE STRAITENED ECONOMY REVIVES

AS A CONSEQUENCE, THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE IN AN EXCELLENT POSITION FOR

A GENERAL ELECTION IN THE FALL . MACMILLAN, WHO WILL BE 69 NEXT MONTH,

SAID DURING HIS TV INTERVIEW THAT HE THOUGHT HE COULD PUT IN ANOTHER

SIX YEARS ON THE JOB, AND ADDED JOKINGLY : " THE QUESTION IS

WHETHER THE PEOPLE COULD STAND ANOTHER SIX . " THE ANSWER

MAY BE LEARNED DURING THE COMING FATEFUL WEEKS IN BRUSSELS .

RUSSIA THE VIEW FROM LENIN HILLS ABOUT A MONTH AGO, SOON AFTER

NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV TOUCHED OFF A GENERAL CRACKDOWN ON MODERN ART (TIME,

DEC . 14), SEVERAL HUNDRED SOVIET ARTISTS AND WRITERS WERE ABRUPTLY

SUMMONED TO THE MODERN, GLASS-WALLED RECEPTION PALACE AT LENIN HILLS,

ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF MOSCOW . KHRUSHCHEV HIMSELF, IT SEEMED, WANTED TO

HEAR WHAT POETS AND PAINTERS THOUGHT OF THE PARTY LINE ON AVANT-GARDE

ART . THE ARGUMENT RAGED FOR FIVE HOURS, FAR INTO THE NIGHT, AND

INCLUDED SEVERAL REMARKABLY FRANK EXCHANGES WITH THE SOVIET RULER . ONE

OF THE FIRST TO SPEAK UP WAS AGING JOURNALIST-PROPAGANDIST ILYA

EHRENBURG, 71 . DEFENDING A CEZANNE-LIKE BLUE AND PURPLE CANVAS CALLED

FEMALE NUDE, DONE BY RUSSIAN PAINTER ROBERT FALK IN 1922, WHICH ART

CRITIC KHRUSHCHEV HAD DERIDED, EHRENBURG SAID : " YOU AND I, NIKITA

SERGEEVICH, ARE GETTING ON AND HAVEN'T GOT MUCH TIME LEFT . BUT FALK'S

PAINTING WILL LIVE AS LONG AS THERE ARE LOVERS OF BEAUTY . " NEXT,

ABSTRACT SCULPTOR ERNST NEIZVESNTY, WHOSE WORK ALSO HAD BEEN ATTACKED

BY NIKITA, TOOK THE FLOOR . " YOU MAY NOT LIKE MY WORK, COMRADE

KHRUSHCHEV, " THE SCULPTOR SAID, " BUT IT HAS THE WARM ADMIRATION OF

SUCH EMINENT SOVIET SCIENTISTS AS KAPITSA AND LANDAU . " RETORTED

KHRUSHCHEV SCORNFULLY : " THAT'S NOT WHY WE ADMIRE KAPITSA AND LANDAU

. " NEIZVESNTY FELL SILENT, BUT OFFICIAL KREMLIN POET EVGENY EVTUSHENKO

ROSE TO HIS FRIEND'S DEFENSE . " HE CAME BACK FROM THE WAR WITH 14

BULLETS IN HIS BODY, " SAID EVTUSHENKO, " AND I HOPE HE WILL LIVE MANY

MORE YEARS AND PRODUCE MANY MORE FINE WORKS OF ART " AS PEOPLE SAY, "

SHOT BACK NIKITA BRUTALLY, " ONLY THE GRAVE CORRECTS A HUNCHBACK . "

EVTUSHENKO MANAGED A BRAVE REPLY : " I HOPE, COMRADE KHRUSHCHEV, WE

HAVE OUTLIVED THE TIME WHEN THE GRAVE WAS USED AS A MEANS OF CORRECTION

. " THE AUDIENCE WAS STUNNED, THEN BURST INTO APPLAUSE ; EVEN

KHRUSHCHEV SHEEPISHLY JOINED IN . EVTUSHENKO'S DISPLAY OF COURAGE DID

NOT LAST LONG . TWO WEEKS AFTER THE LENIN HILLS MEETING, THE PARTY'S

IDEOLOGICAL BOSS, LEONID ILYICHEV, CALLED IN THE POET AND A NUMBER OF

OTHER YOUNG INTELLECTUALS FOR AN ATTITUDE TALK . ILYICHEV WAS

ESPECIALLY ANGRY OVER EVTUSHENKO'S POEM BABI YAR, WHICH CONDEMNED

SOVIET ANTI-SEMITISM AND WHICH HAD JUST BEEN ENTHUSIASTICALLY RECEIVED

IN A NEW SYMPHONIC SETTING BY COMPOSER DMITRY SHOSTAKOVICH . CULTURAL

COMMISSARS QUICKLY CANCELED FURTHER PERFORMANCES OF THE SYMPHONY . AS

FOR THE POEM, SAID ILYICHEV, IT SHOULD BE CHANGED TO INCLUDE AN ATTACK

ON WEST GERMANY . AFTER A SLEEPLESS NIGHT, EVTUSHENKO AGREED TO "

IMPROVE " BABI YAR .

ITALY ADJUSTING THE APERTURA EVER SINCE PREMIER AMINTORE

FANFANI TEAMED UP WITH PIETRO NENNI'S SOCIALISTS ALMOST A YEAR AGO TO

FORM ITALY'S APERTURA A SINISTRA ( " OPENING TO THE LEFT " ), THE

UNEASY ALLIANCE HAS BEEN CLOUDED BY A SINGLE ISSUE : NENNI'S DEMAND

FOR THE CREATION OF 15 REGIONAL ADMINISTRATIONS THAT HE FIGURES WILL

BOOST HIS PARTY'S GRASS-ROOTS SUPPORT . FANFANI AGREED TO PAY NENNI'S

PRICE BECAUSE HE NEEDED THE SOCIALISTS' 88 VOTES IN THE CHAMBER OF

DEPUTIES IN ORDER TO STAY IN POWER, BUT HE STALLED ON ENACTING THE

SCHEME JUST THE SAME . FANFANI FEARED THAT THE SOCIALISTS WOULD SIGN

LOCAL ELECTORAL AGREEMENTS WITH COMMUNISTS AND THEREBY CONVERT THE NEW

REGIONS INTO LEFTIST STRONGHOLDS . EVEN AFTER NENNI PLEDGED NOT TO

COOPERATE WITH THE REDS, MANY OF FANFANI'S CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS REMAINED

SKEPTICAL OF HIS PROMISE . WITH NENNI DEMANDING QUICK ACTION ON THE

REGIONAL PLAN, THE LOOMING ALTERNATIVE WAS COMPROMISE OR COLLAPSE OF

THE COALITION . LAST WEEK FANFANI ACTED . AFTER NINE HOURS OF ARGUMENT,

CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS AND THEIR TWO SMALLER COALITION PARTNERS AGREED TO

INTRODUCE PROMPTLY TWO BILLS COVERING TAXATION AND ADMINISTRATION OF

THE REGIONS ; THEY POSTPONED LEGISLATION ACTUALLY CREATING THEM UNTIL

A NEW PARLIAMENT CONVENES AFTER NATIONAL ELECTIONS IN MAY . THE

SOCIALISTS GRUMBLED BITTERLY, BUT NENNI URGED THEM TO BIDE THEIR TIME .

/ IF THERE'S GOING TO BE A GOVERNMENT CRISIS, " HE TOLD A MEETING OF

HIS PARTY'S CENTRAL COMMITTEE, " IT'S NOT GOING TO BE CAUSED BY US . "

NENNI HAS HIS EYE ON A CABINET POST IN A NEW GOVERNMENT ; CAUSING A

CRISIS AT THE MOMENT WOULD BE IRRESPONSIBLE, FOR FANFANI THIS WEEK GOES

OFF TO VISIT JOHN F . KENNEDY, AND IN A FORTNIGHT HAROLD MACMILLAN

ARRIVES IN ROME . FELLOW TRAVELERS IN THE SOCIALIST HIGH COMMAND WERE

WILLING, EVEN ANXIOUS, TO TOPPLE THE GOVERNMENT, BUT AS THE PARTY

CONTINUED ITS TALKS AT WEEK'S END, IT APPEARED THAT NENNI AND THE

COALITION WOULD SQUEAK THROUGH .

PURSUE OUR NATIONAL EFFORT . THEREFORE WE WILL FOLLOW OUR NATIONAL

: " THE AMERICAN INTEREST IS NOT ALWAYS THE FRENCH INTEREST .

MORE TRUE IN THE FUTURE, WHICH WILL GIVE EUROPE A GREATER AND GREATER

THE CONGO THE INDIA-RUBBER MAN JUST AFTER SUNUP ONE DAY LAST WEEK,

SECESSIONIST MOISE TSHOMBE SLIPPED OUT OF HIS PINK PALACE IN

ELISABETHVILLE, CLIMBED INTO THE BACK SEAT OF A BLACK COMET SEDAN, AND

SPED OFF DOWN THE ROAD TOWARD THE NORTHERN RHODESIAN BORDER . SOON AN

ARMORED COLUMN OF 500 UNITED NATIONS TROOPS WAS ON HIS TAIL . FOR A

MOMENT, IT LOOKED AS IF THE U.N . WERE IN HOT PURSUIT OF ITS OLD FOE .

BUT NO ! TO THE ASTONISHMENT OF BUG-EYED NATIVES ALONG THE WAY, MOISE

WAS ACTUALLY LEADING THE BLUE HELMETS, URGING HIS OWN TATTERED

KATANGESE GENDARMES TO LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS SO THE U.N . COULD REOPEN

VITAL RAIL AND ROAD LINKS . BIZARRE AS IT WAS, THE INCIDENT WAS AN

ACCURATE INDICATOR OF THE WAY THINGS ACTUALLY WERE GOING LAST WEEK IN

THE CONGO'S COPPER-RICH KATANGA PROVINCE, WHERE THE U.N . WAS WAGING

WAR WITH TSHOMBE'S BREAKAWAY REGIME FOR THE THIRD TIME SINCE SEPTEMBER

1961 . IN TWO WEEKS, THE TOUGH U.N . TROOPS HAD SEIZED A STEADILY

LENGTHENING RIBBON OF RAIL LINES AND NEARLY EVERY MAJOR POPULATION

CENTER IN THE PROVINCE . ONLY THE WESTERN COPPER TOWN OF KOLWEZI

REMAINED IN KATANGA'S GRIP ; IT WAS DEFENDED BY 2,000 BOOZY GENDARMES,

100 OF TSHOMBE'S WHITE MERCENARIES, AND A SMASHING BLONDE AMBULANCE

DRIVER KNOWN AS " MADAME YVETTE, " WHO SAUNTERED ABOUT IN PARATROOP

BOOTS, CAMOUFLAGE UNIFORM, BUSH HAT AND SHOULDER HOLSTER . ONLY 50

MILES FROM KOLWEZI, INDIAN INFANTRYMEN PROBED CAUTIOUSLY FORWARD,

WAITING ONLY FOR THE SIGNAL TO HEAD FULL BLAST TOWARD THE TOWN . BUT

THE SIGNAL WOULD NOT BE GIVEN RASHLY, FOR THE RAGTAG MERCENARIES

THREATENED TO BLOW UP A HUGE DAM AND INDUSTRIAL INSTALLATIONS, LEAVING

THE TOWN A BLACKENED SHELL . THEY MIGHT NOT BE BLUFFING . " I AM BACK .

/ BUT WITH FULL BACKING FROM THE U.S . AND THE AFRO-ASIAN NATIONS, THE

U.N . WAS DETERMINED TO DICTATE A

SETTLEMENT TO TSHOMBE AND MAKE IT STICK . IF

IT FAILS, THE REST OF THE CONGO, STARVED OF THE RICHES THAT ENABLE

KATANGA TO ACCOUNT FOR 65 PER CENT OF THE COUNTRY'S EXPORTS, COULD

SPLINTER INTO A SCORE OF WARRING TRIBAL DOMAINS . ALREADY A CORPS OF

100 CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONARIES WAS FLYING INTO ELISABETHVILLE TO

TAKE CHARGE OF KATANGA'S ADMINISTRATION . THE BIG QUESTION MARK, AS

USUAL, WAS THE SLIPPERY TSHOMBE . AS THE WEEK BEGAN, HE WAS HOLED UP

DEFIANTLY IN KOLWEZI WITH THE MERCENARIES . THERE WERE RUMORS THAT HE

MIGHT FLEE TO EUROPE RATHER THAN GIVE IN TO THE U.N . BUT HE WAS NOT

SURRENDERING KATANGA'S TOP JOB . LO AND BEHOLD, HE WAS BACK IN

ELISABETHVILLE . " IN SPITE OF ALL THE TROUBLE AND BLOODSHED, " HE

DECLARED WITH MACARTHURIAN GRANDEUR, " I AM BACK . " WHAT POLICY WOULD

HE FOLLOW ? NO ONE COULD SAY, FOR BEFORE LONG HE WAS BOUNCING WILDLY

FROM ONE POSITION TO ANOTHER . " PURE INDIA RUBBER, " MARVELED A

FOREIGN DIPLOMAT . LUMP OF SUGAR . IN THE SPACE OF THREE DAYS, TSHOMBE

1) PROMISED TO " ABSTAIN FROM MAKING ANY DECLARATIONS AGAINST THE U.N .

/ ; 2) IMMEDIATELY BROKE HIS PROMISE BY THREATENING " A SCORCHED-EARTH

POLICY " IN KOLWEZI (SEE WORLD BUSINESS) ; 3) WAS CLAPPED UNDER HOUSE

ARREST BY INFURIATED U.N . OFFICIALS " TO RESTRAIN HIM FROM FURTHER

IRRESPONSIBLE ACTS " ; AND 4) GOT HIS HOUSE ARREST COMMUTED TO A

NIGHTTIME CURFEW BY LEADING THE U.N . TROOPS TO THE RHODESIAN BORDER .

THEN, HAVING BAFFLED EVERYBODY, HE VANISHED ONCE MORE FROM THE CAPITAL.

WITH TSHOMBE'S KATANGA NOW LARGELY UNDER U.N . CONTROL, CENTRAL

GOVERNMENT PREMIER CYRILLE ADOULA BEGAN FLEXING HIS MUSCLES IN

LEOPOLDVILLE . HE DEMANDED

THAT THE BRITISH AND BELGIAN

CONSULS IN ELISABETHVILLE LEAVE THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY HAD ACTED AS

MEDIATORS FOR TSHOMBE IN HOPES OF ARRANGING A CEASE-FIRE . HE SPURNED A

$2,000,000 GIFT FROM THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF ITS " SUBVERSIVE

POLICY " ON KATANGA, AND ONE OF HIS OFFICIALS SNIFFED : " WE ARE NOT A

LITTLE CHILD WHO CAN BE GIVEN A LUMP OF SUGAR TO KEEP QUIET . " BOX

SCORE . EXUBERANT AS ADOULA WAS OVER TSHOMBE'S PLIGHT, THERE WAS NOT

MUCH FOR HIM TO CROW ABOUT . EVEN IF KATANGA IS SUCCESSFULLY

REINTEGRATED, HE WILL STILL FACE THE EQUALLY FORMIDABLE PROBLEMS OF

ADMINISTRATIVE INCOMPETENCE, OFFICIAL CORRUPTION, ARMY INDISCIPLINE AND

WORST OF ALL RIVALRIES AMONG THE CONGO'S 200 TRIBES . THE POINT WAS

UNDERLINED IN BLOOD LAST WEEK IN KASAI PROVINCE, WHERE FEUDING

TRIBESMEN WERE AT ONE ANOTHER'S THROATS OVER A BORDER DISPUTE . NATIVES

KIDNAPED AND REPORTEDLY ATE TWO BELGIAN LUMBERMEN, THEN BEGAN

SLAUGHTERING ONE ANOTHER IN THE TOWN OF KAKENGE . SUCH GRUESOME

INCIDENTS NO LONGER SURPRISED ANYONE . A LEOPOLDVILLE NEWSPAPER

SOUTH VIET NAM RICE & RATS ONE DAY LAST JULY SERGEANT FIRST

CLASS ROQUE MATAGULAY, 31, A GUAM-BORN U.S . MILITARY ADVISER WITH A

VIETNAMESE DETACHMENT, VENTURED OUT OF HIS COMPOUND NEAR THE COASTAL

TOWN OF PHANTHIET, 90 MILES EAST OF SAIGON, ON AN OFF-DUTY HUNTING TRIP.

INSTEAD OF GAME, SERGEANT MATAGULAY RAN INTO A BAND OF COMMUNIST VIET

CONG GUERRILLAS, WAS HELD CAPTIVE UNTIL HIS RELEASE LAST MONTH . LAST

WEEK, IN HIS FIRST PRESS CONFERENCE SINCE HE WAS FREED, MATAGULAY

DEPICTED THE SPARTAN LIFE AND GRIM DEDICATION OF THE VIET CONG .

MATAGULAY SAID THAT THE VIET CONG MOVED FREELY OVER THE COUNTRYSIDE AND

THAT IN THE VILLAGES PEASANTS FREELY OFFERED REBELS FOOD AND SHELTER .

THE TYPICAL MENU FOR BOTH PRISONER AND CAPTORS WAS RICE, SALT AND FISH

OIL . RATS WERE AN OCCASIONAL DELICACY THAT BRIGHTENED THE DIET SERVED

BOTH AS RAT SOUP AND BARBECUED RODENT . THOUGH GAME WAS PLENTIFUL, THE

REDS NEVER HUNTED . " THEY WERE AFRAID TO USE UP AMMUNITION HUNTING

DEER, " SAID MATAGULAY . FOR THE FIRST SEVERAL MONTHS OF HIS CAPTIVITY,

MATAGULAY WAS TIED UP AND CONSTANTLY REMINDED THAT HE WOULD BE KILLED

ON THE SPOT IF HE MADE THE SLIGHTEST EFFORT TO ESCAPE . HE UNDERWENT NO

PHYSICAL TORTURE, INSTEAD WAS DAILY SUBJECTED TO EIGHT SOLID HOURS OF

POLITICAL INDOCTRINATION AND INTERROGATION . MATAGULAY WAS FORCED TO

LISTEN TO THE ENGLISH-LANGUAGE BROADCASTS ON COMMUNIST NORTH VIET NAM'S

RADIO HANOI THREE TIMES A DAY AND WAS REGULARLY TESTED ON WHAT THEY HAD

TO SAY ABOUT THE WORLD SITUATION . OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE MADAGULAY IS A

DARKSKINNED GUAMANIAN, HIS INTERROGATORS HARPED ON THE PLIGHT OF THE

NEGROES IN THE U.S . SOUTH . AGAIN AND AGAIN, HE REFUSED TO SIGN

ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA DOCUMENTS, BUT FINALLY, WRACKED WITH MALARIA

AND WITH HIS WEIGHT DOWN FROM 185 TO 145, HE SIGNED FOUR STATEMENTS, "

WHEN I BELIEVED I WAS AT THE END OF MY PHYSICAL ENDURANCE . " THE

DOCUMENTS, WHICH MATAGULAY LATER HAD TO READ ALOUD SO THAT THE VIET

CONG COULD RECORD THEM ON TAPE, BITTERLY ATTACKED SOUTH VIET NAM'S

PRESIDENT NGO DINH DIEM AND THE U.S.'S SUPPORT FOR HIS GOVERNMENT .

LAST MONTH, TO CHEER MATAGULAY UP, THE COMMUNISTS SAID THAT THEY WERE

FIXING HIM A SPECIAL CHRISTMAS DINNER . HE NEVER GOT IT . ON CHRISTMAS

EVE THE REDS HELD A RELEASE CEREMONY, INVITED 400 SOLDIERS, PEASANTS,

WOMEN AND CHILDREN TO WITNESS A LAST ACT OF GENEROSITY TO THEIR

PRISONER . MATAGULAY THEN WAS PUT ON A BUS AND SENT BACK TO FREEDOM .

INDIA THE WARNING ON THE WALLS AN OLD CHINESE PROVERB SAYS,

WHERE THERE IS AN EXCESS OF CEREMONY, THERE IS SURE TO BE DECEIT . " IN

RED CHINA LAST WEEK, CEYLON'S VISITING PRIME MINISTER, MRS . SIRIMAVO

BANDARANAIKE, SNIFFED INCENSE, WAS WINED AND DINED BY PREMIER CHOU

EN-LAI, AND WAS EVEN TAKEN TO SEE A RELIC OF BUDDHA'S TOOTH . REASON

FOR THE INDULGENT TREATMENT WAS THE SET OF PROPOSALS THAT MRS .

BANDARANAIKE BROUGHT TO PEKING AS SPOKESMAN FOR THE SIX NONALIGNED

NATIONS GHANA, EGYPT, INDONESIA, BURMA, CAMBODIA AND CEYLON WHO MET IN

COLOMBO LAST MONTH AND TOOK IT UPON THEMSELVES TO ARBITRATE THE BLOODY

HIMALAYAN BORDER DISPUTE BETWEEN CHINA AND INDIA . THE NEUTRALS'

SOLUTION DELIGHTED THE CHINESE, FOR IT SET UP A DEMILITARIZED ZONE

ALONG THE HIMALAYAN FRONTIER AND ACTUALLY GAVE RED CHINA MORE TERRITORY

IN INDIA THAN IT HAD OCCUPIED BEFORE ITS SUDDEN INVASION LAST OCTOBER .

EXPECTING AT LEAST A TOKEN CONDEMNATION OF CHINESE AGGRESSION FROM ITS

OLD NEUTRALIST CRONIES, INDIA WAS, TO SAY THE LEAST, DISAPPOINTED . IN

NEW DELHI, PRIME MINISTER JAWAHARLAL NEHRU RECEIVED MRS . BANDARANAIKE

COOLLY AFTER HER TEN-DAY SOJOURN IN CHINA, BUT DID NOT REJECT HER

PROPOSALS OUTRIGHT . NEHRU STILL HOPES TO GAIN TIME TO BUILD UP HIS

SHATTERED ARMED FORCES . TOO MUCH DELAY, HOWEVER, COULD TRY CHINA'S

PATIENCE ; STILL SCRATCHED ON MANY BUILDINGS IN THE HIMALAYAS IS THE

OMINOUS WARNING LEFT BY CHINESE TROOPS AS THEY WITHDREW AFTER LAST

MONTH'S CEASEFIRE : " WE MAY HAVE TO RETURN . "

GREAT BRITAIN THE SHOCK OF TODAY (SEE COVER)

THE SIGNS AND SYMBOLS OF PROSPERITY ARE EVERYWHERE IN BRITAIN, CROWDING

THE PAST, COMPLICATING THE PRESENT . ALONG ROLLING ROMAN ROADS AND

WINDING COUNTRY LANES, PAST SLEEPING NORMAN CHURCHES AND WHITEWASHED

FARMS, WEEKEND TRAFFIC FLOWS LIKE AN INVADING ARMY . LONDON'S RAW NEW

OFFICE BUILDINGS JOSTLE GEORGIAN MANSIONS ; A HILTON HOTEL STARES

IMPERTINENTLY DOWN ONTO BUCKINGHAM PALACE . BOWLING ALLEYS AND DANCE

HALLS ARE PACKED EACH NIGHT OF THE WEEK . ON CITY ROOFTOPS, TV ANTENNAS

STAND AS THICK AS THE ENGLISH ARCHERS AT AGINCOURT . IN ONE DECADE, THE

NUMBER OF CARS ON THE ROADS HAS DOUBLED (TO 6,000,000), THOUGH THE

ENTIRE ISLAND BOASTS ONLY 190 MILES OF EXPRESSWAY . MOST BRITONS EARN

TWICE AS MUCH AS THEY DID IN 1949, AND THEY ARE GAMBLING AND BETTING

THEIR LOLLY AT THE STUPEFYING RATE OF $3 BILLION A YEAR . ONE OF

LONDON'S MOST EXQUISITE 18TH CENTURY HOUSES OPENED RECENTLY AS AN

OPULENT GAMBLING CLUB . IN THE PAST TWO YEARS, BINGO PALACES AND

BETTING SHOPS HAVE MUSHROOMED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, WHICH SOME NOW

CALL " THE WINDFALL STATE . " THESE DAYS, MORE THAN 3,500,000 " INSULAR

/ BRITONS GO ABROAD EACH YEAR MOSTLY TO THE CONTINENT, WHERE DARTS AND

MARMALADE AND TEA AT 4 : 30 ARE NOW AN ACCEPTED PART OF THE RITES OF

SUMMER . BRITONS ARE BETTER EDUCATED AND IN BETTER HEALTH THAN EVER

BEFORE AND NEED PAY NO DOCTORS' BILLS . YET, FOR ALL THEIR HEADY NEW

AFFLUENCE, THE BRITISH TODAY FEEL DISTURBED AND INSECURE . THEIR

TROUBLED MOOD IS INDEFINABLE BUT INESCAPABLE . IT IS A SENSE OF UNEASE

IN WHICH IS BLENDED THE AWARENESS OF NATIONAL DECLINE, THE CONSCIOUS

SENSE OF FAILURE TO FIND NEW OUTLETS FOR THEIR ENERGIES, A FEELING THAT

MANY OF THEIR HALLOWED INSTITUTIONS AND TRADITIONS ARE INCREASINGLY

IRRELEVANT TO A FORMIDABLY CHANGED WORLD . TWO RINGS . THE NATION'S

COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY, ITS EDUCATION AND ETHICS, WERE ALL DEVELOPED TO

MEET THE CHALLENGE OF GLOBAL POWER . ITS HISTORY BOOKS AND LITERATURE

REVERBERATE WITH THE NAMES OF SOLDIER-HEROES AND THE BATTLEFIELDS ON

WHICH THEY WON AND HELD AN EMPIRE : OMDURMAN AND LUCKNOW, QUEBEC,

KHARTOUM, MAFEKING . IN EVERY CORNER OF THEIR ISLAND, STATUES AND

STREET NAMES STILL CELEBRATE A GLORY THAT HAS PASSED . " YOU USED TO

OPEN THE ATLAS, " MUSES A MANCHESTER BUSINESSMAN, " AND HALF THE WORLD

WAS RED . NOW BRITAIN IS JUST A LITTLE RED SPECK OFF THE COAST OF

EUROPE . " SUEZ CRUELLY DEMONSTRATED TO THE WORLD THAT IT TAKES POWER

TO BE A POWER . BUT EVEN THEN, BRITONS COULD NOT COME TO TERMS WITH THE

HARSH REALITY OF VANISHED MIGHT . THEIR FEELING OF SHOCK TODAY IS ALL

THE GREATER BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN SO LONG DELAYED . AS IF BY SOME

MALEVOLENT DESIGN, A WHOLE SERIES OF FRUSTRATIONS AND FAILURES HAS

BESET BRITANNIA IN A FEW SHORT MONTHS, DEEPENING THE NATION'S ANGST .

THE ABRUPT U.S . CANCELLATION OF THE SKYBOLT MISSILE RUDELY EXPOSED THE

FACT THAT BRITAIN'S " INDEPENDENT " NUCLEAR DETERRENT IS IN FACT ALMOST

WHOLLY DEPENDENT ON WASHINGTON . THERE WAS A TIME WHEN U.S . PRESIDENTS

SOUGHT BRITAIN'S COUNSEL AND EVEN APPROVAL BEFORE TAKING ANY MAJOR

INITIATIVE IN WORLD AFFAIRS ; IN THE CUBAN CRISIS, THE MOST PERILOUS

OF THE LAST FEW YEARS, THE CELEBRATED JACK-MAC TELEPHONE RANG JUST

TWICE . BACK ON THE DOLE . BRITAIN'S INSECURITY HAS BEEN EXACERBATED BY

14 LONG MONTHS OF HAGGLING WITH THE EUROPEANS . SWALLOWING THEIR PRIDE

AND REVERSING CENTURIESOLD TRADITION, THE BRITISH DECIDED IN MID1961 TO

CROSS THE CHANNEL AND MAKE COMMON CAUSE WITH THE CONTINENT . THEN LAST

WEEK, JUST AS THEY WERE WITHIN SIGHT OF THEIR GOAL, CHARLES DE GAULLE

OF FRANCE CONTEMPTUOUSLY CLOSED THE DOOR ON PERFIDIOUS ALBION . EVEN AT

HOME, THE STORM SIGNALS WERE FLYING . ONCE AGAIN THE LINES OF

UNEMPLOYED WORKERS ARE LENGTHENING OUTSIDE LABOR EXCHANGES . THE

HALF-FORGOTTEN WORD " DOLE " IS BACK IN THE LANGUAGE . BRITAIN'S

OVERALL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF 2.6 PER CENT , THOUGH MILD BY U.S .

STANDARDS, IS AT A FOUR-YEAR PEAK AND STILL RISING . MOREOVER, MOST OF

THE 600,000 MEN WITHOUT JOBS ARE CONCENTRATED IN A FEW DOZEN " BLACK

SPOTS " IN THE NORTH, WHERE IN SOME COMMUNITIES UP TO 14 PER PER CENT

OF THE WORK FORCE IS ON THE DOLE ($13 A WEEK FOR A MARRIED MAN) .

GAP NONETHELESS, BRITAIN'S PROSPERITY IS POISED ON A KNIFE EDGE . IN

THE PAST DECADE, ITS ECONOMY HAS GROWN ONLY 2FY PER YEAR ON AVERAGE ;

IN 1962 IT ROSE ONLY 1 PER CENT , WHEREAS IN THE COMMON MARKET EVEN A 4

PER CENT GROWTH RATE IS CONSIDERED DISAPPOINTING . SINCE 1950,

BALANCE-OF-PAYMENTS CRISES HAVE BROUGHT BRITAIN TO THE BRINK OF

BANKRUPTCY SIX TIMES . BY DRACONIAN MEASURES THE GOVERNMENT SUCCEEDED

LAST YEAR IN BOOSTING EXPORTS 3 PER CENT FOR A NEW $11 BILLION POSTWAR

RECORD, HELPING TO MAINTAIN GOLD AND HARD-CURRENCY RESERVES . HOWEVER,

IT WAS ONLY ABLE TO ACHIEVE STABILITY BY CUTTING BACK CREDIT AND

CURBING INDUSTRIAL EXPANSION . " OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE HAD THEIR

ECONOMIC MIRACLES, " SIGHS A MANCHESTER JOURNALIST . " BRITAIN HAS HAD

ITS CRISES . " BRITAIN NEEDED URGENTLY TO EXPAND ITS MARKETS AND

BROADEN ITS SHAKY FINANCIAL BASE . ONCE INSIDE EUROPE, BRITISH INDUSTRY

WAS CONFIDENT THAT IT COULD SUBSTANTIALLY BOOST EXPORTS TO THE SIX . IT

ALSO ANTICIPATED A HEAVY INFLUX OF INVESTMENT CAPITAL FROM U.S . AND

OTHER FOREIGN COMPANIES EAGER TO HAVE A BRITISH TOEHOLD IN THE COMMON

MARKET . IF BRITAIN WERE FINALLY EXCLUDED FROM EUROPE, INVESTMENT WOULD

CONTINUE TO DWINDLE AND BRITAIN MIGHT BE FORCED AS A RESULT TO MAKE

DRASTIC CUTS IN ITS LIVING STANDARDS . MEANWHILE, IT MAY EITHER RETREAT

BEHIND HIGH TARIFF WALLS OR ELSE RETURN TO ITS CLASSIC IDEAL OF FREE

TRADE, POSSIBLY IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE U.S . AND EUROPEAN NATIONS

OUTSIDE THE MARKET . THIS WEEK, AS M.P.S FLOCKED BACK TO WESTMINSTER

FROM THE CHRISTMAS RECESS, UNEMPLOYMENT THREATENED TO BE AN EVEN MORE

EXPLOSIVE ISSUE THAN THE COLLAPSE OF THE COMMON MARKET NEGOTIATIONS .

THE GOVERNMENT'S BEST ASSET IN TIME OF CRISIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE PRIME

MINISTER, A POLITICAL MACHOUDINI WHO CAN SLITHER OUT OF ALMOST ANY TRAP

BY SHEER SLEIGHT-OF-HAND . UNDISTURBED BY THE COUNTRY'S MOUNTING

FRUSTRATION OVER UNEMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING, MACMILLAN DID NOT SWING INTO

ACTION UNTIL LAST SUMMER, AFTER THE TORIES HAD SUFFERED THE WORST

SERIES OF BY-ELECTION REVERSES INFLICTED ON A BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN 40

YEARS . IN HIS THIRD AND MOST DRASTIC CABINET RESHUFFLE SINCE HE TOOK

OFFICE, MACMILLAN PURGED HALF HIS MINISTERS, HANDED KEY POSTS TO SOME

OF THE BRIGHTEST YOUNG POLITICIANS EAST OF THE NEW FRONTIER . TO GINGER

UP THE FALTERING ECONOMY, NEW CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER REGINALD

MAUDLING CUT INTEREST RATES, GAVE GENEROUS NEW TAX CONCESSIONS TO

INDUSTRY, SLASHED PURCHASE TAXES ON AUTOS AND A WIDE RANGE OF CONSUMER

GOODS . TO SPEED HOMEBUILDING AND SLUM CLEARANCE A TASK THAT MACMILLAN

HIMSELF DISCHARGED WITH DISTINCTION IN HIS FIRST CABINET POST IN 1951

THE PRIME MINISTER BROUGHT IN SIR KEITH JOSEPH, 45, AN ASTUTE

POLITICIAN AND ONETIME CONSTRUCTION COMPANY EXECUTIVE, AND GAVE HIM THE

GO-AHEAD FOR A MAJOR PUBLIC-WORKS PROGRAM . GEOFFREY RIPPON, 38, THE

PARTY'S " BACK-ROOM " HOUSING EXPERT, WAS ASSIGNED TO STREAMLINE

ARCHAIC BUILDING CODES AND TECHNIQUES . TWO WEEKS AGO, AS UNEMPLOYMENT

KEPT RISING AND SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT SLUMPED TO AN ALLTIME LOW

(36 PER CENT V . 45 PER CENT FOR LABOR), MACMILLAN ASSIGNED LORD

HAILSHAM, HIS MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND FORMER PARTY CHAIRMAN, TO MAKE A

CRASH EFFORT TO HELP THE WORST DEPRESSED AREAS AS CABINET MINISTER

RESPONSIBLE FOR THE NORTHEAST . THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT HAVE TO CALL AN

ELECTION FOR 21 MONTHS . IT HAS RECENTLY SEEMED LIKELY, HOWEVER, THAT

MACMILLAN WOULD GO TO THE PEOPLE IN THE COMING FALL . BY THEN,

POLITICIANS FIGURED, BRITAIN WOULD HAVE MADE HER TRIUMPHAL ENTRY INTO

THE COMMON MARKET, AND THE GOVERNMENT'S PUMP PRIMING WOULD HAVE THINNED

THE UNEMPLOYMENT ROLLS AND REINVIGORATED THE ECONOMY . BUT AFTER LAST

WEEK'S DIMMING OF HOPES FOR A PROMPT ENTRY INTO EUROPE, THE GOVERNMENT

MAY FEEL CONSTRAINED TO SEEK A NEW MANDATE EVEN EARLIER . THE

CONSERVATIVES HAVE BEEN IN POWER FOR ELEVEN STRAIGHT YEARS, THE LONGEST

UNBROKEN INNINGS THAT ANY PARTY HAS ENJOYED SINCE THE 23-YEAR TORY

REIGN THAT ENDED IN 1830 . SIXTEEN BY-ELECTION SETBACKS FOR THE TORIES

IN THE PAST YEAR HAVE BADLY DENTED MACMILLAN'S PRESTIGE . UNTIL HUGH

GAITSKELL'S DEATH LAST WEEK, A TORY DEFEAT IN THE NEXT ELECTIONS SEEMED

AT LEAST A POSSIBILITY . AGAINST A DEMORALIZED, LEADERLESS OPPOSITION,

THE CONSERVATIVE CHANCES ARE FAR BRIGHTER FOR THE FOURTH STRAIGHT

ELECTORAL VICTORY . SOME EXPERTS SPECULATE THAT HAROLD MACMILLAN MAY

DECIDE TO STEP DOWN AFTER THE ELECTION . HE HAS NO CLEAR HEIR, BUT

DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER R . ARAB " ) BUTLER, AN ASTUTE TACTICIAN WHO IS

DISTRUSTED BY TORY RIGHTWINGERS, WOULD SUCCEED HIM IF MACMILLAN WERE

TOGO DEATH AT THE GATE FOR SYLVANUS OLYMPIO, 60, PRESIDENT OF

TOGO, THE NIGHTMARE BEGAN SHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT . DISTURBED BY STRANGE

SOUNDS IN HIS COMFORTABLE HOUSE IN THE CAPITAL CITY OF LOME, OLYMPIO

CONSTERNATION, WAS A CROWD OF MUTINOUS SOLDIERS CROWDING THE FLOOR

BELOW . BAREFOOT, CLAD IN SHORTS AND SPORT SHIRT, OLYMPIO LEAPED

THROUGH A WINDOW ONTO THE SOFT, SANDY EARTH OF HIS GARDEN . HE MADE IT

OLYMPIO FOUND A PARKED PLYMOUTH SEDAN BELONGING TO THE EMBASSY, AND

CRAWLED IN . THERE, IN THE EARLY MORNING SUNLIGHT, HE WAS SPOTTED

HUDDLED BENEATH THE STEERING WHEEL BY ONE OF THE MUTINEERS . CRYING "

BLOOD JUST OUTSIDE THE COMPOUND . THERE WERE RED FINGER SMEARS ON THE

GATE, AS IF HE HAD STRUGGLED TO RISE . AS EMBASSY AIDES CARRIED THE

TRIBE, WHICH WAS SPLIT BETWEEN BOTH COUNTRIES BY EUROPEAN

BOUNDARY-SETTERS . TWICE BEFORE, ASSASSINS HAD TRIED TO KILL OLYMPIO ;

EACH TIME GHANA'S AGENTS WERE ACCUSED . BUT THIS TIME IT WAS OLYMPIO'S

OWN ZEALOUS ECONOMIES THAT BROUGHT DISASTER . " BON . CA VA . " AS PART

OF HIS ECONOMIC AUSTERITY PROGRAM, OLYMPIO HAD STUBBORNLY REFUSED TO

DEMOBILIZED, HARDEYED TOGOLESE VETERANS OF FRENCH COLONIAL WARS, WHO

WAS SWEPT OUT OF OFFICE AS TERRITORIAL PREMIER FOR THE FRENCH WHEN

OLYMPIO TOOK OVER FIVE YEARS AGO . GRUNITZKY'S FIRST ACT WAS TO

ANNOUNCE THAT TOGO WOULD ALIGN ITSELF WITH THE AFRO-MALAGASY UNION, THE

PRO-FRENCH ASSOCIATION OF WEST AFRICA STATES . THEN HE DECLARED FREE

ELECTIONS WOULD SOON FOLLOW . BUT, AS SO OFTEN HAPPENS IN SUCH

THE CONGO TSHOMBE'S TWILIGHT THE KATANGA STRUGGLE SEEMED OVER AT

LAST . IT HAD BEEN A 2F-YEAR SIEGE THAT BROUGHT THE U.N . CLOSE TO

BANKRUPTCY, SET THE U.S . AT ODDS WITH ITS PRINCIPAL EUROPEAN ALLIES

AND THREATENED TO IMMERSE CENTRAL AFRICA IN BLOOD . NOW, KATANGA'S

REBEL MOISE TSHOMBE SAT WANLY BEHIND A DESK IN A STUCCO COTTAGE IN THE

COPPER TOWN OF KOLWEZI AND DECLARED, " I AM READY TO PROCLAIM

IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE WORLD THAT KATANGA'S SECESSION IS ENDED . " THE

WORDS OF THE MERCURIAL MOISE HAD A FAMILIAR RING, AND THERE WERE

SHRUGGED CENTRAL GOVERNMENT PREMIER CYRILLE ADOULA IN LEOPOLDVILLE . "

IT IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT TSHOMBE HAS DECLARED HIMSELF READY TO

RENOUNCE HIS AMBITIONS TO FOUND AN INDEPENDENT STATE . " WISE ACT . "

BUT THIS TIME TSHOMBE HAD LITTLE CHOICE . BLUE-HELMETED U.N . TROOPS

CONTROLLED NEARLY ALL THE MAJOR RAIL AND POPULATION CENTERS OF KATANGA

PROVINCE, AND U.N . SECRETARY-GENERAL U THANT WAS NOT BACKING DOWN ON

HIS THREAT TO CRUSH KATANGA'S WILY SECESSIONIST . UP TO THE LAST

MOMENT, TSHOMBE WAVERED . HAVING FLED FROM ELISABETHVILLE " A

FRIGHTENED AND DEJECTED MAN, " IN THE WORDS OF BRITISH AND BELGIAN

OFFICIALS, HE TURNED UP LAST WEEK IN KOLWEZI, WHERE THE LAST 3,000 OF

HIS 20,000-MAN GENDARMERIE WERE HOLED UP . A TWO-MAN PEACE MISSION

COMPOSED OF JACQUES HOUARD, BELGIUM'S CONSUL GENERAL IN SALISBURY,

SOUTHERN RHODESIA, AND ANDRE VAN ROEY, DIRECTOR OF KATANGA'S NATIONAL

BANK, FOLLOWED HIM THERE . FOR 36 DESPERATE HOURS, THE TWO URGED HIM TO

YIELD RATHER THAN CARRY OUT HIS THREAT TO BLOW UP THE HUGE DAMS AND

COPPER AND COBALT MINES OPERATED BY THE GIANT UNION MINIERE COMPANY IN

KOLWEZI . FINALLY, CONVINCED THAT HE HAD NO ALTERNATIVE, TSHOMBE GAVE

IN . LATER, APPARENTLY TO SHOW NEWSMEN WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED, HE

DROVE THEM TO A MINOR HYDROELECTRIC SUBSTATION 70 MILES OUTSIDE

KOLWEZI, AIMED A SIX-POUND ARTILLERY PIECE AT IT AND PULLED THE LANYARD.

THE SHOT WAS RIGHT ON TARGET . THE SUBSTATION, APPARENTLY LOADED WITH

DYNAMITE, DISINTEGRATED WHILE TSHOMBE GUFFAWED . AS A FINAL ACT OF

OBSTREPEROUSNESS HE HAD PEACEMAKER HOUARD THROWN OUT OF KATANGA

BECAUSE, AS FOREIGN MINISTER EVARISTE KIMBA COMPLAINED, " YOU HAVE DONE

NOTHING FOR US . " BUT TSHOMBE WAS BEATEN NONETHELESS . EVEN HIS OLD

ALLY, SIR ROY WELENSKY, PRIME MINISTER OF THE RHODESIAS AND NYASALAND,

TOLD HIM HE HAD " ACTED WISELY " IN YIELDING . IS EVERYBODY HAPPY ?

THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT PROMISED MOISE " A GENERAL AND COMPLETE AMNESTY

/ FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FOLLOWERS . WITH THAT, TSHOMBE RETURNED TO

ELISABETHVILLE TO WORK OUT THE PROCEDURES OF HIS CAPITULATION WITH U.N.

OFFICIALS . HE FOUND THAT SOME OF THE DETAILS HAD ALREADY BEEN TAKEN

CARE OF THE BLUE-AND-GOLD FLAG OF THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT NOW FLUTTERED

OVER THE KATANGESE DEFENSE MINISTRY . SIXTY CIVIL SERVANTS AND 120

CONGOLESE ARMY OFFICERS ARRIVED FROM LEOPOLDVILLE TO TAKE OVER

KATANGA'S MILITARY REMNANTS AND ADMINISTER POSTAL SERVICE,

TELECOMMUNICATIONS, CUSTOMS AND IMMIGRATION . AS RESIDENT MINISTER,

LEOPOLDVILLE'S TOP MAN IN KATANGA WOULD BE SLIGHT, SOBER JOSEPH ILEO,

PATRICE LUMUMBA WAS DEPOSED IN 1960 . THE QUESTION NOW WAS WHETHER

LEOPOLDVILLE'S CENTRAL GOVERNMENT COULD KEEP KATANGA UNDER CONTROL NOW

THAT IT WAS WON . IF THE MOB VIOLENCE BACK IN LEO ITSELF WAS ANY

INDICATION, U.N . TROOPS WOULD HAVE TO STAY ON IN KATANGA FOR QUITE A

WHILE . DOWN LEO'S BOULEVARD ALBERT STORMED 600 STUDENTS AND STREET

URCHINS, SHOUTING " TSHOMBE TO THE GALLOWS ! " AT THE BRITISH

EMBASSY, WHICH IS CONSIDERED FAIR GAME BECAUSE OF LONDON'S FRIENDLY

POLICY TOWARD KATANGA, THE MOB BATTERED DOWN THE DOORS, SACKED THE

OFFICES, AND TRIED TO PRY OFF A COAT OF ARMS BECAUSE, AS ONE STUDENT

CRIED, " IT'S MADE OF KATANGA COPPER .! " AFTER AN HOUR, THE U.N.'S

JOYOUSLY BY SOME OF THEIR FORMER COMRADES IN ARMS, NAHLAWI'S MEN ISSUED

A PUBLIC DEMAND THAT THEIR DISCHARGES BE CANCELED, AND THAT A NEW

TUNISIA PALS NO MORE ONE OF THE MOST PERISHABLE COMMODITIES IN THE

ARAB WORLD SEEMS TO BE GRATITUDE . WHEN ALGERIA WON INDEPENDENCE FROM

FRANCE AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF BLOODY WAR, ITS PEOPLE WERE DEEPLY INDEBTED

TO NEIGHBORING TUNISIA, WHOSE PRESIDENT HABIB BOURGUIBA, 59, HAD GIVEN

SHELTER TO 200,000 ALGERIAN REFUGEES AND PROVIDED A REFUGE FOR THE

TRAINING AND EQUIPMENT OF 18,000 ALGERIAN FIGHTING MEN . BUT LAST WEEK,

IN A SHOUTING, GESTICULATING SPEECH IN THE VAST CASBAH SQUARE OF TUNIS,

BOURGUIBA SAID IT WAS " SURPRISING " TO DISCOVER THAT ALGERIA HAS "

BECOME A RESIDENCE FOR CRIMINALS AND PLOTTERS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF

TUNISIA . " HE SEEMED MOSTLY UPSET BY THE FACT THAT ALGERIA HAS REFUSED

TO EXTRADITE ONE BOUBEKER MUSTAFI, A TUNISIAN ACCUSED OF BEING PARTY TO

THE CHRISTMAS ASSASSINATION PLOT AGAINST BOURGUIBA (TIME, JAN . 4), FOR

WHICH 13 TUNISIANS HAVE BEEN CONDEMNED TO DEATH . BOURGUIBA RIDICULED

EXCITED YOUTH, " AND " A SIMPLE-MINDED PEASANT, " BUT CONCEDED THAT "

NOT ALL MEMBERS OF THE ALGERIAN GOVERNMENT WERE INVOLVED . " IN ANY

BORE ALL THE SIGNS OF A U.S.-SOVIET DEAL . FIRST THE NEWS BROKE THAT

PREMIER KHRUSHCHEV, IN A SECRET LETTER TO PRESIDENT KENNEDY, HAD AGREED

TO REMOVE THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE TO A NUCLEAR TEST-BAN TREATY BY

PERMITTING ON-SITE INSPECTIONS IN RUSSIA . SOON AFTERWARD, THE U.S .

CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS PREPARING TO DISMANTLE ITS JUPITER BASE IN

TURKEY, THE VERY THING THAT KHRUSHCHEV HAD DEMANDED WHEN THE U.S .

FORCED HIM TO GET HIS MEDIUM-RANGE MISSILES OUT OF CUBA, AND ITS BASES

IN ITALY, TOO . WAS THERE REALLY A DEAL ? NO . THE TWO EVENTS HAVE

REALLY NO CONNECTION . THE KHRUSHCHEV OFFER, WHILE PROOF OF HIS

CONTINUED MELLOWING, IS NEGLIGIBLE ; ANY TEST BAN WOULD DEPEND ON

CONDITIONS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FULFILL NOW . AS FOR THE REMOVAL OF

AMERICAN MISSILE INSTALLATIONS FROM TURKEY AND ITALY, ITS PURPOSE, SAID

PRESIDENT KENNEDY, IS SIMPLE TO PUT THE U.S . " IN A STRONGER POSITION

/ BY SUBSTITUTING POTENT POLARIS SUBMARINES FOR THE IMMOBILE,

VULNERABLE IRBMS, SITTING DUCKS FOR SOVIET RETALIATION . SOLID V .

LIQUID . MONTHS BEFORE KHRUSHCHEV SUGGESTED HIS CUBA-FOR-TURKEY SWAP,

THE JOINT CHIEFS HAD BEGUN CONSIDERING THE PHASE-OUT OF BASES IN

TURKEY, ITALY, AND IN ENGLAND AS WELL . THE DISMANTLING OF THE 60 THOR

MISSILES IN BRITAIN IS TO BEGIN THIS SPRING . MORE THAN COMPENSATING

FOR THEIR LOSS ARE EIGHT POLARIS SUBS OPERATING OUT OF HOLY LOCH,

SCOTLAND, EACH TOTING 16 MISSILES . TO REPLACE THE 15 JUPITERS IN

TURKEY AND THE 30 IN ITALY, THE U.S . PLANS TO DEPLOY POSSIBLY SIX SUBS

IN MEDITERRANEAN WATERS . TOTAL FIREPOWER : 96 MISSILES, EACH WITH A

NUCLEAR-TIPPED WARHEAD PACKING THE EQUIVALENT OF 800,000 TONS OF TNT .

COMPARED WITH JUPITER'S 1,500-MILE REACH, THE CURRENT POLARIS MISSILES

HAVE A RANGE OF 1,380 TO 1,725 MILES, AND BEFORE LONG THE SUBS WILL GET

A-3 MODELS WITH A 2,875MILE RANGE . THOUGH MOSCOW IS HARD AT WORK ON

ANTI-SUB DEVICES, U.S . EXPERTS SEE NO EVIDENCE THAT THE RUSSIANS HAVE

COME UP WITH AN EFFECTIVE DEFENSE AGAINST THE FLEET OF 41 POLARIS SUBS

THAT WILL BE AT SEA BY 1967 . BOTH TURKEY AND ITALY SWIFTLY ACCEPTED

THE CHANGEOVER . TO PROVIDE BERTHING FACILITIES FOR THE SUBS, THE U.S .

HOPES TO EXPAND ITS NAVAL BASE AT ROTA ON SPAIN'S ATLANTIC COAST .

QUESTION OF BOXES . THE CHANCE OF A WORKABLE NUCLEAR TEST-BAN TREATY

SEEMED EQUALLY REMOTE . ACTUALLY, KHRUSHCHEV FIRST AGREED TO THE

PRINCIPLE OF ON-SITE INSPECTIONS WAY BACK IN 1959, WHEN BRITAIN'S PRIME

MINISTER MACMILLAN WAS IN MOSCOW, ONLY TO SHELVE IT AFTER HE BROKE THE

THREE-YEAR TEST MORATORIUM IN 1961 . BUT HAVING CONCLUDED HIS OWN

LATEST NUCLEAR TEST SERIES, KHRUSHCHEV DOUBTLESS FIGURES THAT HE HAS

LITTLE TO LOSE FROM AN EFFORT TO STOP ALL TESTING FOR A WHILE . " THE

TIME HAS COME NOW, " KHRUSHCHEV WROTE KENNEDY JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS, "

TO PUT AN END ONCE AND FOR ALL TO NUCLEAR TESTS . WE ARE READY TO MEET

YOU HALFWAY . " TO NIKITA, HALFWAY MEANT TWO OR THREE INSPECTIONS EACH

YEAR TO INVESTIGATE SUSPICIOUS TREMORS ; THE U.S . THOUGHT THAT EIGHT

INSPECTIONS WOULD BE THE MINIMUM, HAVING WHITTLED THAT DOWN FROM ITS

ORIGINAL TWELVE . WHILE THE U.S . HAS BEEN DEMANDING THAT AT LEAST A

DOZEN UNMANNED SEISMIC DETECTION STATIONS, OR " BLACK BOXES, " BE

INSTALLED ON SOVIET SOIL, KHRUSHCHEV SAID THAT THREE WOULD DO ONE EACH

IN SIBERIA'S ALTAI MOUNTAINS, THE VIRGIN LANDS OF SOVIET CENTRAL ASIA

AND THE SOVIET FAR EAST . " WE BELIEVE, " HE CONCLUDED, " THAT NOW THE

ROAD TO AGREEMENT IS STRAIGHT AND CLEAR . " ATMOSPHERIC NOISE . THIS

WAS CLEARLY NOT KENNEDY'S VIEW, BUT HE DECLARED HIMSELF " ENCOURAGED, "

SUGGESTED THAT EXPLORATORY TALKS BE HELD AND, AFTER THEY GOT STARTED,

ORDERED A HALT TO THE CURRENT SERIES OF U.S . UNDERGROUND TESTS TO

IMPROVE THEIR CHANCES OF SUCCESS . LAST WEEK SOVIET U.N . AMBASSADOR

NIKOLAI T . FEDORENKO AND VETERAN GENEVA NEGOTIATOR SEMYON K .

TSARAPKIN WERE CLOSETED IN WASHINGTON WITH U.S . ARMS CONTROL AND

DISARMAMENT AGENCY CHIEF WILLIAM C . FOSTER AND BRITISH AMBASSADOR SIR

DAVID ORMSBY GORE . THERE WAS NO SHORTAGE OF PROBLEMS . IN MOSCOW, DOUR

FOREIGN MINISTER ANDREI GROMYKO DECLARED, " FRANCE MUST SIGN, " FULLY

AWARE THAT DE GAULLE HAS NO INTENTION OF JOINING A TEST BAN . ANOTHER

QUESTION WAS HOW TO RING IN RED CHINA, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO EXPLODE AN

A-BOMB BY YEAR'S END . SINCE PEKING HAD NOT YET DONE SO, GROMYKO SAID,

THE PROBLEM WAS " ARTIFICIAL . " ANXIOUS TO KEEP THE TALKS GOING, U.S .

OFFICIALS GRASPED AT STRAWS  AND HOPEFUL PHRASES .  " I DON'T THINK

THIS CLOSES THE DOOR, " SAID ONE . " IT'S JUST ATMOSPHERIC NOISE . "

GREAT BRITAIN AFTER HUGH, WHO ? THE DEATH OF HUGH

GAITSKELL HAS LEFT BRITAIN'S OPPOSITION WITHOUT A SINGLE FIGURE WHO CAN

BE COUNTED ON TO UNITE THE LABOR PARTY BEHIND HIM . WORSE YET, WITH

ELECTION TALK IN THE AIR, LABORITES FEAR THAT NO LIKELY SUCCESSOR IS OF

SUFFICIENT STATURE TO WIN IMMEDIATE NATIONAL ACCEPTANCE AS A POTENTIAL

PRIME MINISTER . THE PARTY IS TORN BETWEEN TWO LEADING CONTENDERS WHO

PERSONIFY THE WARRING EXTREMES WITHIN THE PARTY THAT TOOK HUGH

GAITSKELL SEVEN TURBULENT YEARS TO PACIFY . TOP RIGHT-WING CANDIDATE IS

DEPUTY LEADER GEORGE BROWN, AN EARTHY, ONETIME ERRAND BOY WHO

INFURIATES LEFTIST INTELLECTUALS BY ADDRESSING THEM AS " BROTHER . "

BROWN, 48, IS A STAUNCH ANTI-COMMUNIST, A FIRM BELIEVER IN THE WESTERN

ALLIANCE, AND, UNTIL GAITSKELL COMMITTED THE PARTY TO AN ANTI-EUROPEAN

LINE, WAS A VIGOROUS ADVOCATE OF BRITISH MEMBERSHIP IN THE COMMON

MARKET . GUTTY, IMPULSIVE, OFTEN EXPLOSIVELY GAUCHE, BROWN HAS HAD

LITTLE FORMAL EDUCATION OR TOP-LEVEL ADMINISTRATIVE EXPERIENCE, BUT IS

A KNOWLEDGEABLE DEFENSE EXPERT WHO CRITICIZED BRITAIN'S COMMITMENT TO

THE SKYBOLT MISSILE AS FAR BACK AS 1960 . HIS MOST IMPRESSIVE

ENDORSEMENT CAME LAST WEEK FROM THE PRESTIGIOUS ECONOMIST, WHICH ARGUED

THAT CRITICISMS OF HIS QUICK TEMPER AND IMPATIENCE WITH TECHNICAL

DETAIL " COULD ALSO HAVE BEEN LEVIED AGAINST WINSTON CHURCHILL . "

UNLIKE GAITSKELL, WHOSE POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY WAS BASED ON AN

ESSENTIALLY OUT-OF-DATE VIEW OF AN " INSULAR AND DOWNTRODDEN ENGLAND, "

ARGUED THE WEEKLY, BROWN'S SOCIALISM IS THAT " OF AN AGE WHEN

INTELLIGENT THRUSTERS HAVE LEARNED TO LOOK FORWARD IN OPPORTUNITY . " /

LITTLE HAROLD . " LABOR'S LEFT WING SUPPORTS HAROLD WILSON, 46, AN

ADROIT, URBANE DEBATER AND TOPNOTCH INTELLECT WHO WAS AN OXFORD

ECONOMICS DON AT 21 . AS PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE IN CLEMENT

ATTLEE'S CABINET, PIPE-PUFFING YORKSHIREMAN WILSON HAS HAD MORE

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPERIENCE THAN ANY OF HIS RIVALS, IS THE PARTY'S

FOREIGN POLICY SPECIALIST . DESPITE HIS BRILLIANCE AND CHARM, WILSON'S

FOES, WHO CALL HIM " LITTLE HAROLD, " REGARD HIM AS A SLIPPERY

OPPORTUNIST WHO BACKS ONLY WINNING CAUSES THOUGH HE MISCALCULATED IN

1960 WHEN HE ATTEMPTED TO GRAB THE LEADERSHIP WHILE GAITSKELL WAS

FIGHTING FOR HIS POLITICAL LIFE AGAINST THE PARTY'S POWERFUL ANTI-NATO

BLOC . BROWN DEFEATED WILSON FOR THE DEPUTY LEADERSHIP, 133 TO 103,

LAST YEAR . BUT THIS TIME BROWN HAS AN ADDED CHALLENGE : JAMES

CALLAGHAN, 50, WHO ALSO HAS STRONG MIDDLE-ROAD AND RIGHT-WING SUPPORT .

A NAVAL PETTY OFFICER'S SON WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN CHANCELLOR OF THE

EXCHEQUER IN A GAITSKELL CABINET, " STOKER " CALLAGHAN IS A HARD-BOILED

DEBATER AND EFFECTIVE TV PERFORMER, BUT IS REGARDED BY MANY COLLEAGUES

AS A LIGHTWEIGHT . TO PREPARE FOR THE CHANCELLORSHIP, HE HAS BEEN

CRAMMING WITH SOME OF OXFORD'S BRIGHTEST YOUNG DONS, WHO PRIVATELY RATE

HIM " B OR B-PLUS . " HE IS AN ENGAGING, HARD-WORKING POLITICIAN, AND

MANY OF BROWN'S SUPPORTERS FEAR THAT HE MAY SPLIT THE RIGHT-WING VOTE .

IN A DEADLOCK, HE COULD EVEN EMERGE AS LABOR'S LEADER . FOE'S WOES .

THE CHOICE OF AN EFFECTIVE OPPOSITION LEADER HAS SELDOM SEEMED MORE

IMPORTANT TO THE LABOR PARTY OR TO THE NATION PARTICULARLY SINCE

GOVERNMENTAL POWER IN BRITAIN HAS IN RECENT YEARS INCREASINGLY MOVED

FROM THE COMMONS AND THE CABINET INTO THE HANDS OF THE PRIME MINISTER .

ADMITTEDLY, THE LIKELIHOOD OF A LABOR PRIME MINISTER IN THE NEAR FUTURE

HAS BEEN DIMMED BY GAITSKELL'S DEATH . ON THE OTHER HAND, THE TORIES

HAVE LITTLE IMMEDIATE CAUSE FOR CONFIDENCE : ON TOP OF CHARLES DE

GAULLE'S BRUSQUE REJECTION OF THE GOVERNMENT'S BID FOR COMMON MARKET

MEMBERSHIP, UNEMPLOYMENT THE MOST CRUCIAL ISSUE IN BRITISH POLITICS

TODAY HAS JUMPED AN ALARMING 25 PER CENT IN ONE MONTH, REACHING A

16-YEAR RECORD OF 814,632 (PARTLY DUE TO LAYOFFS IN THE BITTER WINTER

WEATHER) . LABOR'S LEADER WILL PROBABLY NOT BE CHOSEN UNTIL

MID-FEBRUARY . LABORITES HOPED THAT TORY SETBACKS WOULD GIVE THEM TIME

TO DEVELOP A WINNING PERSONALITY WHO COULD KEEP THEIR PARTY UNITED .

UNITED NATIONS MAN AS AN END IN HIMSELF IN THE LOBBIES AND

MEETING HALLS OF THE UNITED NATIONS, U.S . AMBASSADOR ADLAI STEVENSON

OFTEN HEARS THE ARGUMENT OF NEW NATIONS THAT DEMOCRACY IS A LUXURY THEY

CANNOT AFFORD . STEVENSON CAN MAKE A GOOD CASE TO THE CONTRARY, AS HE

SHOWED LAST WEEK IN AN ELOQUENT ADDRESS IN MANHATTAN BEFORE THE CENTER

FOR THE STUDY OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS : " THERE IS PRECIOUS

LITTLE DIGNITY OR EQUALITY IN OUR NATURAL STATE . MOST HUMAN BEINGS

HAVE TO SPEND THEIR LIVES IN UTTER VULNERABILITY . ALL ARE BORN

UNEQUAL, IN TERMS OF CAPACITY OR STRENGTH . . . AND SURVIVE ONLY THROUGH

THE RESTRAINT SHOWN BY MORE POWERFUL NEIGHBORS . FOR NEARLY 3,000 YEARS

/ WESTERN MAN' HAS STRUGGLED TO CREATE A SOCIAL ORDER IN WHICH WEAK,

FALLIBLE, OBSTINATE, SILLY, MAGNIFICENT MAN CAN EXERCISE HIS FREE AND

RESPONSIBLE CHOICE . " WHETHER DEMOCRACY CAN PREVAIL IN THE GREAT

UPHEAVAL OF OUR TIME IS A VALID QUESTION . WE HAVE GOOD REASON TO KNOW

HOW CLUMSY, SLOW, INEFFICIENT AND COSTLY IT IS COMPARED TO THE

CELERITY, CERTAINTY AND SECRECY OF ABSOLUTISM . BUT THE IMPORTANT THING

IS THAT IT HAS SURVIVED . THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT EVEN THE

ABSOLUTISTS MASQUERADE AS DEMOCRATS ; EVEN THE MILITARY AND

QUASI-MILITARY DICTATORSHIPS STRIVE IN THE NAME OF DEMOCRACY TO MANAGE

THE PUBLIC BUSINESS . AND ALL OF THEM SAY THAT AUTHORITARIANISM IS ONLY

A NECESSARY TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY . . . THE ENEMIES OF FREEDOM,

WHATEVER THE MAGNIFICENT ENDS THEY PROPOSE THE BROTHERHOOD OF MAN, THE

KINGDOM OF SAINTS, " FROM EACH ACCORDING TO HIS ABILITY, TO EACH

ACCORDING TO HIS NEEDS' MISS JUST THIS ESSENTIAL POINT : THAT MAN IS

GREATER THAN THE SOCIAL PURPOSES TO WHICH HE CAN BE PUT . HE MUST NOT

BE KICKED ABOUT EVEN WITH THE MOST HIGH-MINDED OBJECTIVES . HE IS NOT A

MEANS OR AN INSTRUMENT . HE IS AN END IN HIMSELF . " THIS IS THE

ESSENCE OF WHAT WE MEAN BY DEMOCRACY NOT SO MUCH VOTING SYSTEMS OR

PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEMS OR ECONOMIC OR LEGAL SYSTEMS (THOUGH THEY ALL

ENTER IN), AS AN IRREVOCABLE AND FINAL DEDICATION TO THE DIGNITY OF MAN.

IN THIS SENSE, DEMOCRACY IS PERHAPS MANKIND'S MOST AUDACIOUS

EXPERIMENT .

THE CONGO TEA & HARMONY IT WAS ALMOST AS WACKY AS THE MAD

HATTER'S OUTDOOR TEA PARTY IN WONDERLAND . SMACK IN THE MIDDLE OF A

MUDFOULED ROAD AT PUMPI, 40 MILES FROM SECESSIONIST MOISE TSHOMBE'S

LAST-DITCH HEADQUARTERS AT KOLWEZI, UNITED NATIONS BRIGADIER REGINALD

NORONHA SET UP FOUR FOLDING TABLES AND LAID OUT TEA, PEANUTBUTTER

SANDWICHES, COFFEE AND SIMBA BEER . AT 9 A.M., RIGHT ON SCHEDULE, FOUR

KATANGA PROVINCE OFFICIALS AND THREE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNION

MINIERE MINING OUTFIT ROARED UP IN TWO AUTOS . " WE HAVE COME TO MEET

YOU AS FRIENDS, " DECLARED ONE, AND THE PARTY WAS ON . DESPITE THE

APPARENT ABSURDITY OF IT, THE PUMPI TEA PARTY WAS A DEAD SERIOUS AFFAIR

ARRANGED SO THAT TSHOMBE COULD PEACEFULLY ESCORT UNITED NATIONS TROOPS

INTO KOLWEZI, THE LAST MAJOR OBJECTIVE IN ITS DRIVE TO END KATANGA'S

2F-YEAR SECESSION . TYPICALLY, TSHOMBE FAILED TO SHOW UP AT THE PARTY,

BUT THE OPERATION WENT SMOOTHLY ANYWAY . WHEN THE SANDWICHES WERE

MUNCHED AND THE TEA SIPPED, NORONHA LED A THREE-MILE COLUMN OF 1,000

INDIAN TROOPS STRAIGHT INTO KOLWEZI . WHERE WERE THOSE PROUD KATANGESE

DEFENDERS ? HUNDREDS OF GENDARMES HAD FLED INTO THE BUSH BEFORE THE

BLUE-HELMETED U.N . TROOPS ARRIVED . SOME 75 WHITE MERCENARIES,

INCLUDING A PISTOL-PACKING BLONDE AMBULANCE DRIVER KNOWN AROUND TOWN AS

MADAME YVETTE, HAD TAKEN OFF FOR THE ANGOLAN BORDER . BUT MOST OF

TSHOMBE'S 2,000 BEDRAGGLED MEN PAID HEED TO HIS PLEA TO " COOPERATE

WITH THE U.N . AND OUR CONGOLESE BROTHERS, " DUTIFULLY STACKED THEIR

ARMS AT A NEARBY DEPOT . AT HIS YELLOW VILLA ON THE EDGE OF KOLWEZI,

TSHOMBE GREETED NORONHA WITH A GRIN . " NOBODY SHOT AT YOU, I SEE, " HE

CRACKED . REPLIED NORONHA, THROWING AN ARM AROUND TSHOMBE'S SHOULDERS,

/ I HAVE COME TO THANK YOU FOR KEEPING YOUR WORD . " NORONHA WAS NOT

THE ONLY ONE WHO WAS RELIEVED THAT TSHOMBE WAS STICKING TO HIS PROMISE

TO REINTEGRATE KATANGA WITH THE REST OF THE CONGO . AT U.N .

HEADQUARTERS IN MANHATTAN,SECRETARY-GENERAL U THANT COULD NOW TURN TO A

PROBLEM THAT MIGHT TURN OUT TO BE EVEN TOUGHER THAN ENDING TSHOMBE'S

SECESSION . IT WAS TO ESTABLISH THE CONGOLESE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT'S

AUTHORITY OVER ALL THE CONGO AND END THE ANARCHY THAT STILL REIGNS IN

MUCH OF THE NATION . AS A STARTER, THANT APPEALED FOR $19 MILLION TO

FINANCE 1963 CIVILIAN OPERATIONS IN THE CONGO, ESTIMATED THAT AT LEAST

1,300 TECHNICAL EXPERTS WOULD BE NEEDED AT ONCE IN THE BIGGEST AID

PROGRAM THE U.N . HAS YET UNDERTAKEN . THE PLAN IS TO CUT THE U.N.'S

IRAN THE MUNIFICENT KING ONCE AGAIN THE STREETS OF TEHERAN RANG

WITH ANGRY SHOUTS . TWO THOUSAND WORKERS INVADED THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS

TO BATTLE STUDENTS . IN THE TEEMING BAZAAR, STEELHELMETED POLICE BEAT

BACK RELIGIOUS LEADERS WHO WERE ATTEMPTING A THREE-DAY STRIKE . ALL THE

EXCITEMENT WAS OVER THE SOCIAL REFORMS OF IRAN'S 43-YEAR-OLD KING OF

KINGS, SHAH MOHAMMED REZA PAHLEVI . AFTER YEARS OF HESITATION, THE SHAH

AT LAST WAS TEARING THE LAND FROM IRAN'S FEUDAL VILLAGE OWNERS AND

RELIGIOUS LEADERS, DISTRIBUTING IT TO THE PEASANTS, AND FORCING FACTORY

OWNERS TO GIVE WORKERS A 20 PER CENT SHARE OF THEIR PROFITS . THE

MOSLEM MULLAHS (PRIESTS), WHOSE SHRINE LANDS WERE UP FOR LEASING TO

IRAN'S LANDLESS FARMERS, DID NOT LIKE THE IDEA AT ALL . STUDENTS

PROTESTED THE SHAH'S DISSOLUTION OF THE MAJLIS (PARLIAMENT) A YEAR AND

A HALF AGO AFTER THE LEGISLATORS RIGGED ELECTIONS, THEN CRIPPLED THE

ROYAL LAND REFORM BILL WITH 93 AMENDMENTS . SINCE THEN, RULING BY

DECREE, THE SHAH HAS DISTRIBUTED 2,000,000 ACRES OF PRIVATE LAND (WITH

COMPENSATION TO OWNERS) TO SOME 50,000 PEASANT FAMILIES IN 3,500

VILLAGES . IT WAS SOME RECORD FOR A MONARCH WHO ONCE SEEMED INEFFECTUAL

AND POWERLESS TO STAVE OFF THE GROWING DISCONTENT OF IRAN'S POOR MASSES.

A DECADE BEFORE, FEW WOULD HAVE IMAGINED THAT WORKERS AND FARMERS

WOULD BE CRYING HIS SLOGANS, WAVING HIS BANNERS . BUT THERE THEY WERE

ON THE EVE OF THE BIG REFERENDUM CALLED TO GIVE THE NATION'S YES OR NO

TO HIS SWEEPING PLANS FOR AID TO NEEDY RURAL AND CITY IRANIANS . WOMEN,

WHO GOT THE VOTE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN IRAN'S HISTORY, GATHERED AT

POLLING PLACES TO SHOUT, " LONG LIVE MOHAMMED REZA SHAH FOR GRANTING US

FREEDOM . " THE NATION'S POOR WERE EQUALLY ENTHUSIASTIC, FLOCKED TO

CAST THEIR BALLOTS IN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBERS . THE SHAH EXPECTED A

LANDSLIDE VICTORY, AND SURE ENOUGH, EARLY RETURNS BACKED HIS REFERENDUM

BY THE LOPSIDED MARGIN OF 1,000 TO ONE . THE POPULAR ENTHUSIASM WAS

DOUBTLESS AIDED BY THE SHAH'S ANNOUNCEMENT ON THE EVE OF ELECTIONS THAT

HE WAS GIVING UP THE LAST OF HIS OWN ROYAL LAND, 3,500,000 ACRES ON THE

CASPIAN'S CAVIAR COAST .

ALGERIA THE HIGH COST OF INDEPENDENCE NOT LONG AGO, THE

WEST WAS READY TO WRITE OFF ALGERIA'S BRASH, SLOGANEERING PREMIER AHMED

BEN BELLA AS A MEDITERRANEAN CASTRO RIPE FOR RED DOMINATION . BUT TIMES

DO CHANGE . AFTER SEVEN MONTHS OF INDEPENDENCE, BEN BELLA NOW RELIES ON

A TIDE OF AID FROM THE WEST, NOT THE EAST, TO KEEP HIS STRUGGLING

COUNTRY AFLOAT . ONLY LAST WEEK, FINANCE MINISTER AHMED FRANCIS

RETURNED FROM PARIS WITH PLEDGES OF $280 MILLION IN FRENCH AID FOR 1963.

AT THE SAME TIME, THE U.S . TENTATIVELY AGREED TO LAUNCH A FOOD

RELIEF PROGRAM FOR HARDHIT ALGERIAN PEASANTS ; BEN BELLA HOPES THIS

CAN BE BROADENED INTO A SWEEPING PROGRAM OF ECONOMIC AID BEFORE LONG .

EMPTIED BY WAR . RAVAGED BY 7F YEARS OF WAR WITH FRANCE, THE BLOODY

S.A.O . TERROR AND A FRATRICIDAL POWER STRUGGLE THAT SOURED THE FIRST

MONTHS OF INDEPENDENCE, ALGERIA NEEDS EVERY CENTIME IT CAN GET . ONLY

ONE ALGERIAN IN TEN HAS A STEADY JOB . THE ILLITERACY RATE IS 90 PER

CENT . OFFICIALS FIGURE THAT THE COUNTRY NEEDS AT LEAST $2 BILLION TO

REBUILD, BUT THE TREASURY IS BARE . SAID BEN BELLA : " WE ARE A

COUNTRY EMPTIED BY WAR . " TO FILL IT UP AGAIN, BEN BELLA NEEDS WESTERN

HELP . AT FIRST, EMBITTERED BY HIS 5F YEARS IN FRENCH PRISONS, HE

BLINKERED HIMSELF TO THAT FACT . HE THREATENED TO TURN ALL REMAINING

FRENCH-OWNED LANDS INTO STATE-RUN FARMS . HE SAUNTERED OFF TO HAVANA TO

EMBRACE FIDEL CASTRO RIGHT AFTER A MEETING WITH PRESIDENT KENNEDY . HE

ACCEPTED WHAT LITTLE RED AID HE GOT WITH GREAT FANFARE, BUT

DELIBERATELY PLAYED DOWN FAR MORE EXTENSIVE HELP FROM THE WEST

INCLUDING A FLOOD OF FOOD SHIPMENTS FROM PRIVATE U.S . CHARITIES THAT

HAVE KEPT NEARLY HALF OF HIS 10 MILLION PEOPLE FROM STARVING . BUT

BENEATH THE BLUSTER BEN BELLA IS MORE PRAGMATIST THAN DOGMATIST, AND

ALGERIA'S SORRY STATE PERSUADED HIM TO BEGIN TACKING WITH THE WESTERN

WIND . " HE IS DETERMINED TO FEED, CLOTHE AND EMPLOY HIS PEOPLE, " SAID

ONE WESTERN DIPLOMAT, " AND HE'S GOING TO KICK OVER ANY " ISMS' THAT

GET IN HIS WAY . " OVER THE PROTESTS OF MILITANT MARXISTS, HE BEGAN

PROMOTING " HEALTHY COOPERATION " WITH FRANCE, SOUGHT INCREASED AID . "

THEY ARE DUTY BOUND TO HELP US RECONSTRUCT, " HE SAID IN AN INTERVIEW

WITH TIME CORRESPONDENT JAMES WILDE . " THIS WOULD HELP DISSIPATE ALL

THAT WENT BEFORE . " FRANCE IS COMMITTED TO GIVE ALGERIA A MINIMUM OF

$200 MILLION A YEAR FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS AND IS SPONSORING ITS

ASSOCIATION WITH THE COMMON MARKET . NEARLY 90 PER CENT OF THE

1,200,000 EUROPEANS WHO ONCE TENDED ALGERIA'S VINEYARDS AND RAN ITS

BUSINESSES HAVE FLED (ALONG WITH SOME 200,000 JOB-SEEKING MOSLEMS), BUT

OFFICIALS NOW ARE ANXIOUS TO LURE BACK TEACHERS, TECHNICIANS AND

ADMINISTRATORS TO HELP STRAIGHTEN OUT THE MESS . YEAR OF AUSTERITY . TO

STRENGTHEN HIS SHAKY POSITION, BEN BELLA IS CLEARING THE FIELD OF

OPPOSITION BY PERSUASION WHERE POSSIBLE, FORCE WHERE NECESSARY . HE HAS

BANNED ALL PARTIES EXCEPT HIS NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (F.L.N.) .

FORTNIGHT AGO, HE OUSTED EXTREME LEFTIST LEADERS OF THE 300,000-MEMBER

GENERAL UNION OF ALGERIAN WORKERS BECAUSE THEY WERE RESISTING HIS

RAPPROCHEMENT WITH FRANCE, REPLACED THEM WITH TRUSTED PRO-GOVERNMENT

MEN . THOUGH THE PROBLEMS OF REGIONALISM AND MARAUDING GUERRILLAS STILL

PLAGUE HIM, HE HAS MANAGED TO WIN OVER MOST OF THE HOSTILE TRIBAL

CHIEFTAINS IN THE HINTERLANDS TO HIS SIDE . BEN BELLA'S BIGGEST PROBLEM

BY FAR IS THE ECONOMY . THIS YEAR, HE SAID, WILL BE ONE " OF AUSTERITY,

OF CONVALESCENCE . " TO SHOW THAT HE MEANS BUSINESS, HE PUSHED THROUGH

A SKIN-AND-BONES BUDGET OF $564 MILLION, GIVING SOME MINISTRIES

ONE-TENTH OF WHAT THEY HAD DEMANDED . HE ALSO PUT A $400-A-MONTH

CEILING ON ALL GOVERNMENT SALARIES HIS OWN INCLUDED AND SLAPPED A 100

PER PER CENT TAX ON INCOME ABOVE $800 A MONTH . TO THE ASCETIC BEN

BELLA, WHO LIVES IN A DINGY, THREE-ROOM BACHELOR FLAT WITH A NEPHEW WHO

DOES ALL THE COOKING AND CLEANING, THAT SEEMS PERFECTLY REASONABLE .

EGYPT SURPRISE AT SUEZ WHEN EGYPT'S PRESIDENT GAMAL ABDEL NASSER

GRABBED THE SUEZ CANAL 6F YEARS AGO, HIS BITTER ENEMIES IN EUROPE

PREDICTED THAT THE BIG DITCH WOULD SOON BE FILLED WITH SILT AND THAT

UNTRAINED EGYPTIAN PILOTS WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO STEER SHIPPING THROUGH

SAFELY . THE CRITICS TURNED OUT TO BE WRONG ON BOTH COUNTS . EGYPT HAS

WIDENED THE CANAL WITH BYPASSES PERMITTING THREE CONVOYS DAILY TO USE

THE WATERWAY MORE EFFICIENTLY, AND DEEPENED IT SUFFICIENTLY TO

ACCOMMODATE MOST OF THE WORLD'S TANKER FLEET . LAST YEAR 18,518 SHIPS

TRAVELED THROUGH THE CANAL, 370 MORE THAN IN 1961 . FURTHER PLANS CALL

FOR ADDITIONAL DEEPENING OF THE CANAL, AND MAKING IT TWO-WAY FOR ITS

ENTIRE 102-MILE LENGTH . FORMER STOCKHOLDERS OF THE OLD SUEZ CANAL CO .

WERE FIRMLY CONVINCED IN 1956 THAT THEY WOULD NEVER GET A CENT OUT OF

THEIR NATIONALIZED INVESTMENT . BUT WITH 1962 REVENUE AT A WHOPPING

$149.5 MILLION (45 PER CENT ABOVE 1955), NASSER'S CANAL OFFICIALS HAVE

ANNOUNCED PAYMENT OF THE FINAL $11.4 MILLION INSTALLMENT ON THE $81.2

MILLION COMPENSATION DEBT . RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CANAL'S SUCCESS IS ITS

EGYPTIAN BOSS, DYNAMIC, BALDING MAHMOUD YOUNIS, 50, A ONETIME ARMY

ENGINEER AND A CLOSE FRIEND OF NASSER SINCE THE DAYS WHEN THEY SHARED

AN OFFICE AT THE STAFF OFFICERS COLLEGE, EGYPT'S WEST POINT . THOUGH

YOUNIS HAD NEVER SAILED SO MUCH AS A ROWBOAT, NASSER PICKED HIM TO RUN

THE BUSY WATERWAY SHORTLY AFTER THE BRITISH AND FRENCH SHIP PILOTS

WITHDREW FROM THE CANAL IN SEPTEMBER 1956 . AT FIRST, YOUNIS HAD

AVAILABLE ONLY 26 TRAINED PILOTS OF THE 250 NORMALLY REQUIRED, BUT HE

KEPT THE CANAL FUNCTIONING AROUND THE CLOCK . " I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING

ABOUT SHIPS, " HE SAID . " BUT I DID KNOW A LOT ABOUT MOVEMENT CONTROL

FROM THE ARMY . KEEPING THE SHIPS SHUTTLING BACK AND FORTH WAS A SIMPLE

MATTER COMPARED WITH ORGANIZING A BATTLE . " YOUNIS TAKES GREAT PRIDE

IN THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS EGYPTIAN PILOTS . " THEY THOUGHT THAT ONLY

EUROPEANS COULD RUN THE CANAL, BUT THEY WERE WRONG, " HE SAYS . " I

HAVE NO INFERIORITY COMPLEXES . TO ME, MANAGEMENT IS A SCIENCE THAT

ANYONE CAN MASTER . " U.S . SHIPPERS ARE FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR THE

EFFICIENT SERVICE THEY GET IN YOUNIS' CANAL . TO THEM, HE SHRUGS, " IN

CANADIAN AND AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE OFFICERS . FORESEEN IS THE

LENGTHENING OF INDIAN RUNWAYS AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A RADAR NETWORK

SO THAT WESTERN INTERCEPTOR SQUADRONS, COMPLETE WITH PILOTS AND GROUND

PERSONNEL, CAN MOVE INTO INDIA TO PROVIDE A PROTECTIVE AIR UMBRELLA

OVER ITS CITIES . THE IDEA WOULD NOT QUITE CONSTITUTE A MILITARY

ALLIANCE, BUT IT WOULD SURELY BE INDIA'S MOST DECISIVE STEP AWAY FROM

NEUTRALISM .

EUROPE A NEW & OBSCURE DESTINATION

IN AN ALLIANCE IN WHICH PARTNERS HAD BECOME INCREASINGLY

MINDFUL OF ONE ANOTHER'S SENSITIVITIES, IN WHICH VICTORIES WERE

TACTFULLY NOT CROWED OVER, AND TOGETHERNESS IN ITSELF WAS REGARDED AS A

GOOD THING, CHARLES DE GAULLE LAST WEEK REMINDED THE WORLD OF WHAT ONE

MAN WITH A WILL CAN DO . OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS, ON HIS OWN PEOPLE AND

ON THEIR NEIGHBORS, CHARLES DE GAULLE HAS PERFECTED HIS NATIVE TALENT

FOR HANDING OUT RUDE SURPRISES . EMPLOYING THE LOFTY DISDAIN THAT USED

TO INFURIATE ROOSEVELT, CHURCHILL AND STALIN, DE GAULLE SUCCEEDED IN

INFURIATING KENNEDY, MACMILLAN AND A HOST OF OTHERS BY VETOING

BRITAIN'S ADMISSION TO THE COMMON MARKET . HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN GENTLE

ABOUT IT, ALLOWING NEGOTIATIONS TO SPUTTER OUT IN A CONFUSION OF

DETAILS . HE CHOSE TO BE BLUNT AND HIS PURPOSE WAS NOT JUST TO SHUT

OUT BRITAIN OR MERELY TO HUMILIATE HER . HE ALSO SHOOK THE ATLANTIC

ALLIANCE TO ITS ROOTS, SET OUT TO CONTEST ITS LEADERSHIP AND TO PUT IN

QUESTION THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE U.S . IN EUROPE . FOR THE WEST !

HE CREATED A DRAMATIC HISTORICAL TURN, AN OBSCURE DESTINATION . DEAD

MECHANISM . WESTERN EUROPE HEARD THE NEWS WITH ANGER AND DISMAY . WEST

GERMANY'S ECONOMICS MINISTER LUDWIG ERHARD BLAMED DE GAULLE FOR A "

BLACK DAY, " DECLARING THAT " THE COMMON MARKET IS NOW ONLY A MECHANISM

AND NO LONGER A LIVING THING . " ALFRED MULLERARMACK, WEST GERMANY'S

CHIEF NEGOTIATOR AT BRUSSELS, QUIT HIS JOB IN DISGUST . JEAN MONNET,

THE DYNAMIC OPTIMIST WHO IS THE FATHER OF THE COMMON MARKET, LAMENTED

THAT " THERE NOW LOOMS DISUNION WITH ITS INHERENT DANGERS . " BRITAIN'S

PRIME MINISTER HAROLD MACMILLAN TOLD HIS COUNTRY ON TV : " WHAT

HAPPENED AT BRUSSELS WAS BAD . BAD FOR US, BAD FOR EUROPE, BAD FOR THE

WHOLE WORLD . " , " BRUTAL " WAS THE WORD HEARD MOST OFTEN IN WHITEHALL

AND AROUND THE WHITE HOUSE TO DESCRIBE DE GAULLE'S BEHAVIOR . ARCHITECT

OR AT LEAST CO-DESIGNERS OF THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE, U.S .

POLICYMAKERS WERE PLUNGED INTO GLOOM . " MOST UNFORTUNATE, " SAID THE

STATE DEPARTMENT . IN CONGRESS THERE WERE REVIVED MUTTERINGS ABOUT THE

INEFFICACY OF FOREIGN AID AND THE INGRATITUDE OF ALLIES . ARKANSAS'

SENATOR WILLIAM FULBRIGHT TALKED OF THE " TEMPORARY ABERRATION " OF THE

MAN . A NATION THAT HAD HOPED TO BE IN A POSITION TO PROFIT FROM THE

COMMUNIST SPLIT BETWEEN RUSSIA AND RED CHINA FOUND A DEEP CREVICE

OPENING AT ITS FEET . AND THOUGH THE KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION DID NOT

SPEAK OF AN " AGONIZING REAPPRAISAL " OF ITS RELATIONS WITH A

RECALCITRANT FRANCE AS JOHN FOSTER DULLES ONCE HAD U.S . MILITARY AND

DIPLOMATIC POLICY TOWARD EUROPE WAS PLAINLY IN NEED OF ONE . COMMUNITY

TWILIGHT . EXCEPT FOR A GLOW OF PRIDE, TEMPERED WITH NERVOUS CONCERN,

AMONG SOME FRENCHMEN, THE ONLY CHEERFUL VOICES WERE BEING RAISED IN

MOSCOW, WHERE SOVIET IDEOLOGISTS SUDDENLY THOUGHT THEY SAW CONFIRMATION

OF THE HOARY MARXIST-LENINIST TENET THAT CAPITALIST COUNTRIES WILL

INEVITABLY BE DESTROYED BY THEIR " INNER CONTRADICTIONS . " CRIED A

RUSSIAN SPOKESMAN : " THIS IS THE TWILIGHT OF THE SO-CALLED EUROPEAN

COMMUNITY . A DIFFICULT NAVIGATION NOW AWAITS THE AMERICAN SHIP OF

STATE . " NOT JUST THE FACT OF WHAT CHARLES DE GAULLE HAD ALREADY DONE

TORMENTED HIS ALLIES : IT WAS WHAT HE MIGHT YET DO . AND THEY SEARCHED

HIS PRESCIENT PRONOUNCEMENTS FROM THE PAST (SEE BOX) FOR CLUES . FOR 20

YEARS THE U.S . HAS BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO LEAD THE FREE WORLD, AND IN THAT

TIME WESTERN EUROPE ROSE FROM THE ASHES BEHIND A SHIELD OF U.S MEN AND

MONEY . FRANCE ITSELF HAS RECEIVED $9.5 BILLION IN OUTRIGHT AID AND

$1.8 BILLION IN LOANS SINCE 1945 . THERE HAVE OF COURSE BEEN DISPUTES

AND DIFFERENCES OF OPINION, BUT UNTIL LAST WEEK, NO DIRECT CHALLENGE OF

U.S . LEADERSHIP . WHAT THE U.S . NOW FACED WAS A PROPOSAL THAT EUROPE

RALLY ROUND FRANCE TO CREATE A THIRD FORCE IN THE WORLD CAPABLE OF

DEALING INDEPENDENTLY WITH BOTH THE U.S . AND RUSSIA . THIS HAD BEEN DE

GAULLE'S PROCLAIMED GOAL FOR YEARS, BUT EVERYONE HAD COUNTED ON HIS OWN

REALISTIC APPRECIATION OF THE INCREASING GAINS TO FRANCE AND EUROPE OF

THE CURRENT COURSE OF ATLANTIC PARTNERSHIP . IT WAS A CROWNING IRONY

THAT DE GAULLE'S EFFORT TO GIVE EUROPE A NEW VOICE, DIRECTION AND

SELF-ASSURANCE IS PRECISELY WHAT THE U.S . HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO EVER

SINCE WORLD WAR II . BUT THE U.S . HARDLY EXPECTED THINGS TO WORK OUT

QUITE THIS WAY .

PICTURES IN THE LOUVRE .

THAT THEY DID IS THE

RESPONSIBILITY OF ONE MAN CHARLES ANDRE MARIE JOSEPH DE GAULLE, 72 .

HIS ABILITY TO BRING A SKILLFUL INFLUENCE TO BEAR UPON EVENTS SHOULD BE

ENOUGH TO SEND A BELIEVER IN IMPERSONAL HISTORICAL DETERMINISM BACK TO

HIS BOOKS . TALL AND UNGAINLY, SO DIM-EYED THAT HE CONSTANTLY STUMBLES,

SO SELDOM A LISTENER THAT HE SEEMS DEAF, DE GAULLE SHOULD BE A FIGURE

OF FUN (AND SOMETIMES IS), BUT THE GREATNESS IN THE MAN USUALLY

SURVIVES THE MOCKERY . HIS MIND IS LIKE THE LOUVRE, FILLED WITH BATTLE

PICTURES IN WHICH THE FRENCH ARE ALWAYS WINNING ; HIS HEART THROBS

WITH SIMPLE EMOTIONS LABELED PATRIE, DIEU, GLOIRE, AND HE HAS A GIFT

FOR PROPHECY THAT IS MORE OLD TESTAMENT THAN 20TH CENTURY MODERN . DE

GAULLE'S FAULTS ARE COMMON TO MANY MEN HE IS BULLHEADED, ARROGANT,

TOUCHY, MORE RESPONSIVE TO FLATTERY THAN CRITICISM, INSUFFERABLY PROUD

OF HIS INTELLECT AND INSIGHT . HIS VIRTUES, HOWEVER, ARE RARE IN ANY

AGE, AND ARE SUMMED UP IN THE WORD CHARACTER . WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK

IN BRUSSELS WAS A HEAD-ON COLLISION BETWEEN CHARLES DE GAULLE'S DESIGN

FOR EUROPE AND THE WIDER, WORLD-EMBRACING ATLANTIC POLICY FOLLOWED BY

THE LAST THREE AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND BY MOST OF THE PARLIAMENTARIANS

OF EUROPE . LOFTED UMBRELLA . THE U.S . ATTITUDE, ON WHICH ONE

PRESIDENTIAL SPEECHWRITER HUNG THE AMBITIOUS PHRASE " GRAND DESIGN, "

IS TO ACCEPT AND WORK FOR THE CONCEPT OF A STRONG, UNITED EUROPE LINKED

IN PARTNERSHIP WITH NORTH AMERICA, BOTH ACTING TOGETHER TO RAISE THE

LIVING STANDARDS AND SECURE THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE NATIONS OF AFRICA,

ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA . TO MAKE THIS DESIGN ENDURING, THE U.S .

INSISTED THAT BRITAIN BECOME A MEMBER OF THE COMMON MARKET, FOLLOWED BY

THE SCANDINAVIAN AND OTHER NATO COUNTRIES . THE DEFENSE OF THIS GRAND

DESIGN WOULD BE TWOFOLD : CONVENTIONAL ARMS AND ARMIES SUPPLIED BY

EUROPE, AND THE NUCLEAR UMBRELLA HELD ALOFT BY THE U.S . DE GAULLE'S

EUROPEAN DESIGN IS INTROVERTED, SMALLER, AND DEPENDENT MORE ON AUDACITY

AND CLEVERNESS THAN ON SHEER POWER . IN EFFECT, IT REPRESENTS ANOTHER

OF THE HISTORIC EFFORTS TO CREATE A UNIFIED EUROPE UNDER FRENCH

LEADERSHIP AN AMBITION THAT WAS PURSUED IN THE PAST BY CHARLEMAGNE,

LOUIS XIV, NAPOLEON BONAPARTE AND NAPOLEON III . TO DE GAULLE, EUROPE'S

RIVERS AND MOUNTAINS ARE NOT BARRIERS, BUT THE OCEANS ARE . SINCE 1940

HE HAS DREAMED OF PERSUADING THE " STATES ALONG THE RHINE, THE ALPS AND

THE PYRENEES TO FORM A POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND STRATEGIC BLOC ; TO

ESTABLISH THIS ORGANIZATION AS ONE OF THE THREE WORLD POWERS, AND,

SHOULD PICKUP STRATEGIC BLOC ; TO ESTABLISH THIS ORGANIZATION AS ONE

OF THE THREE WORLD POWERS, AND, SHOULD IT BECOME NECESSARY, AS THE

ARBITER BETWEEN THE SOVIET AND THE ANGLOAMERICAN CAMPS . " GARGANTUAN

STOCKS . CONCEIVABLY, DE GAULLE AT ONE POINT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WEANED

AWAY FROM HIS DREAM . WHEN HE RETURNED TO POWER IN 1958 TO LEAD A

FRANCE STILL RIVEN BY THE ALGERIAN WAR, HE DEMANDED ADMISSION TO A

THREE-POWER DIRECTORATE OF NATO, BUT THE IDEA WAS BLACKBALLED BY

EISENHOWER AND MACMILLAN . HE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN AS INTRANSIGENT

AS A CO-DIRECTOR AS HE HAS BEEN WITHOUT BECOMING ONE . SINCE THEN, HE

PROGRESSIVELY WITHDREW FRENCH GROUND AND NAVAL FORCES FROM NATO

COMMANDS, BANISHED U.S . NUCLEAR WARHEADS FROM FRENCH SOIL, AND SANK

BILLIONS OF FRANCS INTO A CRASH PROGRAM TO CREATE A NUCLEAR FORCE DE

FRAPPE OF HIS OWN . AS OF LAST WEEK THE FORCE DE FRAPPE CONSISTED OF A

HANDFUL OF ATOM BOMBS AND A DELIVERY SYSTEM OF EXACTLY FOUR MIRAGE IV

JETS, EXTREMELY FAST (MACH 2), HIGHALTITUDE, TWO-SEAT LIGHT BOMBERS .

THE MIRAGE IV'S RADIUS IS ONLY 1,000 MILES . ADMITTEDLY THE FORCE DE

FRAPPE IS A MODEST OPERATION AND ONE THAT COULD SWIFTLY BE KNOCKED OUT

OF THE AIR, EVEN WHEN, BY 1965, THE FRENCH HOPE TO HAVE 350 PLANES

CAPABLE OF CARRYING ATOMIC WEAPONS . DE GAULLE CONCEDES THAT HIS

NUCLEAR WEAPONRY WILL NEVER MATCH THE GARGANTUAN AND LETHAL STOCKPILES

OF RUSSIA AND THE U.S . BUT HE THINKS THAT IT IS BIG ENOUGH AND

MURDEROUS ENOUGH TO GIVE ANY POTENTIAL AGGRESSOR PAUSE AND BESIDES, IT

IS HIS OWN . UNFIT ISLANDERS . IN DE GAULLE'S EUROPE, FRANCE IS FIRST,

GERMANY SECOND, AND THE REST NOWHERE THEY CAN TAG ALONG RESPECTFULLY AS

CAMP FOLLOWERS, WITH LITTLE MORE WEIGHT OR VOICE THAN TINY LUXEMBOURG .

BRITAIN IS REJECTED AS UNFIT ECONOMICALLY OR POLITICALLY TO JOIN THIS

BAND OF CONTINENTAL BROTHERS BECAUSE IT 1) IS AN OFFSHORE ISLAND, AND

2) HAS " SPECIAL TIES " WITH THE U.S . AND THE COMMONWEALTH . TO DE

GAULLE'S JAUNDICED EYE, THE BRITISH ATTEMPT TO ENTER THE COMMON MARKET

WAS SIMPLY A TROJAN HORSE MANEUVER (AN EXPRESSION USED WITH SUSPICIOUS

FREQUENCY IN PARISIAN EDITORIALS AND SALONS LAST WEEK) STAGED BY

WASHINGTON TO MAKE SURE THAT THE U.S . DOMINATION OF EUROPE WOULD NOT

BE FRUSTRATED . BRITAIN DID MUCH TO ARRANGE HER OWN FATE . IN 1950,

LONDON WAS OFFERED MEMBERSHIP IN THE EUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITY

AND REFUSED . SEVEN YEARS LATER, LONDON WAS INVITED TO JOIN IN THE

FOUNDING OF THE COMMON MARKET, AND AGAIN REFUSED . AS THE COMMON MARKET

GOT UNDER WAY, BRITAIN TRIED TO CRIPPLE IT BY SETTING UP ITS OWN RAGTAG

RIVAL BLOC, THE SEVEN-NATION EUROPEAN FREE TRADE ASSOCIATION (WITH

AUSTRIA, DENMARK, NORWAY, PORTUGAL, SWEDEN, SWITZERLAND) . BUT THE

RUNAWAY ECONOMIC SUCCESS OF THE COMMON MARKET CAUSED BRITAIN'S

CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT TO REVERSE ITSELF, AND, IN AUGUST 1961, BRITAIN

PENITENTLY APPLIED FOR THE MEMBERSHIP IT HAD ONCE SPURNED . IT ASKED

FOR FULL, NOT ASSOCIATE MEMBERSHIP, WITH ALL THAT THIS IMPLIED IN

DECLARING ITSELF EUROPEAN . THE APPLICATION MIGHT HAVE BEEN RECEIVED IN

BRUSSELS, DE GAULLE INSISTED THAT BRITAIN BRING IT TO PARIS INSTEAD .

/ MATTER OF DAYS . " DURING THE SLOW FIRST YEAR OF THE BRUSSELS

NEGOTIATIONS, DE GAULLE WAS NOT ACTIVELY IN OPPOSITION . BUT HE SOON

MADE IT CLEAR HE CONSIDERED THE BRITISH AS SUPPLIANTS, NOT EQUALS :.

THEY COULD NOT HOPE TO CHANGE THE RULES AS A CONDITION OF JOINING THE

CLUB . THE TECHNICAL DISCUSSIONS RANGED FROM SUCH OBSCURE ITEMS AS THE

TARIFF ON KIPS AND PIGMEAT TO IMPORTANT ONES CONCERNING FUTURE TRADE

WITH AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND . BY LAST MONTH, OF MORE THAN 2,500 BIG

AND SMALL QUESTIONS, ALL BUT 26 HAD BEEN AMICABLY RESOLVED . BRITAIN'S

CHIEF NEGOTIATOR, EDWARD HEATH, WAS SO OPTIMISTIC THAT ON JAN . 21 HE

CONFIDENTLY TOLD A U.S . OFFICIAL : " IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF DAYS

BEFORE THE QUESTION IS SETTLED IN OUR FAVOR .

THIS WAS BRAVE BUT FOOLHARDY DISREGARD OF THE

IMPERIOUS NON UTTERED JUST A WEEK BEFORE IN DE GAULLE'S CELEBRATED

PRESS CONFERENCE, THE THEATRICAL SHOCKER IN WHICH THE " INSULAR,

MARITIME " BRITISH WERE HAUGHTILY TOLD TO TRANSFORM THEMSELVES INTO "

EUROPEANS " BEFORE JOINING THE COMMON MARKET . DE GAULLE HAS LONG BEEN

SUSPICIOUS OF BRITAIN'S CLOSE TIES WITH THE U.S., AND SUSPECTS THAT

SECRETS CAN BE EXCHANGED IN THE COMMON ENGLISH LANGUAGE . BUT DE

GAULLE'S DETERMINATION TO VETO BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP APPARENTLY CAME

JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS, WHEN THE NEWS ARRIVED OF THE KENNEDY-MACMILLAN

MEETING AT NASSAU . AT NASSAU, BRITAIN GOT FORMAL WORD THAT THE U.S .

WOULD NOT SUPPLY IT WITH SKYBOLT, THE AIRBORNE MISSILE ON WHICH THE

BRITISH HAD PINNED ALL THEIR HOPES FOR DELIVERING THEIR NUCLEAR

DETERRENT . SKYBOLT SHATTERED THE BRITISH, AND DISQUIETED THE FRENCH AS

WELL, SINCE IT WAS REGARDED AS PROOF THAT NUCLEAR DEPENDENCE ON ANOTHER

POWER WAS RISKY . IF THE U.S . COULD TREAT IN THAT FASHION AN ALLY TO

WHOM IT WAS TIED BY BLOOD, LANGUAGE AND TRADITION, WHAT COULD FRANCE

EXPECT ? DE GAULLE WAS FURTHER ANGERED BY MACMILLAN'S AGREEMENT TO

SHARE POLARIS WITH THE U.S . INSTEAD OF MOVING TO SHARE NUCLEAR

KNOWLEDGE WITH FRANCE . THAT WAS WHEN THE PHRASE " TROJAN HORSE " FIRST

BEGAN TO BE USED IN PARIS . OVERNIGHT CASE . BRUSSELS, THE SCENE OF

BRITAIN'S DASHED HOPES LAST WEEK, IS A DOUR, NEON-LIT OLD MAID OF A

CITY . ON MONDAY, THE COBBLED STREETS WERE SLIMY WITH BLACK SLUSH AND

BLANKETED WITH CHILLING FOG AS BRITAIN'S CHIEF NEGOTIATOR, EDWARD

HEATH, ARRIVED WITH HIS AIDES, MINISTER FOR COMMONWEALTH AFFAIRS DUNCAN

SANDYS AND AGRICULTURE MINISTER CHRISTOPHER SOAMES . THE FRENCH, WITH A

FINE SENSE OF ECONOMY, TRAVELED LIGHT ; ONLY LUXEMBOURG'S FOUR-MAN

DELEGATION WAS SMALLER . FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER MAURICE COUVE DE

MURVILLE BROUGHT ONLY AN OVERNIGHT CASE, FOR HE KNEW THAT HE WOULD NOT

BE STAYING LONG . COUVE ARRIVED AN HOUR LATE FOR THE START OF THE

MEETING AT QUATRE BRAS, THE MODERN FOREIGN MINISTRY BUILDING .

NEWSMEN'S QUESTIONS TO HIM DIED IN THE AIR AT THE GRIM SET OF THE

FRENCHMAN'S FACE . A PATH TWO FEET WIDE MIRACULOUSLY PARTED THE CROWD

AND, LIKE AN APPARITION OR A LEPER COUVE MOVED UNMOLESTED TO THE

ELEVATOR . WHEN THE DELEGATES EMERGED FROM THE MEETING AT MIDNIGHT,

WEST GERMANY'S ECONOMICS MINISTER LUDWIG ERHARD, A STAUNCH SUPPORTER OF

BRITAIN, GRUNTED, " WE MADE ONLY LINGUISTIC PROGRESS . " A FRENCH

DELEGATE LIGHTLY ADDED, " IF WE REACH AN AGREEMENT, IT WILL BE BASED ON

A MISUNDERSTANDING . " ON TUESDAY MORNING, U.S . AMBASSADOR JOHN

TUTHILL HURRIED AROUND TO THE DELEGATIONS TO DELIVER A LASTMINUTE

WARNING FROM PRESIDENT KENNEDY, POINTING OUT THE GRAVE CONSEQUENCES OF

A BREAKDOWN IN THE NEGOTIATIONS . THE SIX RECONVENED AT NOON TO HEAR

THE WEST GERMAN PROPOSAL THAT WAS INTENDED TO SAVE FACE FOR EVERYONE BY

POSTPONING A DECISION FOR TWO MONTHS . A STORMY DISCUSSION FOLLOWED,

AND COUVE DE MURVILLE ICILY PROFESSED ASTONISHMENT THAT A PLAN COULD

EVEN BE PROPOSED IN SUCH BAD PARLIAMENTARY FORM .

MONSTROUS THING .  IN TURN, THE DELEGATES OF THE OTHER FIVE WARNED

OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF A RUPTURE, BUT FRANCE'S COUVE DE MURVILLE WAS

ADAMANT .  WALTER HALLSTEIN, CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMON MARKET COMMISSION,

TRIED TO CHANGE THE WORDING OF THE PROPOSAL TO MAKE IT MORE ACCEPTABLE

TO THE FRENCH .  HE FAILED .  THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT SUMMON HEATH

TO HEAR THE FINAL VERDICT .  EACH HEAD OF DELEGATION READ A PREPARED

STATEMENT .  BELGIUM'S SPAAK CALLED THE RUPTURE A "MONSTROUS THING ."

DUTCH FOREIGN MINISTER JOSEPH LUNS WAS EQUALLY BITTER, WHILE

GERMANY'S SCHRODER POINTEDLY TOLD THE FRENCH THAT THE BUNDESTAG HAD

ONLY RATIFIED THE TREATY OF ROME IN THE FIRST PLACE ON THE ASSUMPTION

THAT IT WOULD BE WIDENED TO EMBRACE NEW MEMBERS .  THEN AT LAST IT

WAS COUVE DE MURVILLE'S TURN .  COUVE, A BRILLIANT, CIVILIZED,

HIGHLY TRAINED DIPLOMATIST, WHO AMONG HIS COLLEAGUES WOULD USUALLY

BE SEEKING ANY NEW AVENUE OF COMPROMISE, WAS NOW PLAINLY LITTLE MORE

THAN A MESSENGER BOY FOR LE GRAND CHARLES .  "IT IS BEING SAID THAT WE

BROKE OFF THE NEGOTIATIONS," HE DECLARED .  "IN REALITY, OUR

RESPONSIBILITY HAS BEEN THAT OF MAKING CLEAR THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS HAVE

BEEN TAKING PLACE IN A VACUUM SINCE OCTOBER, AND OF HAVING SAID THAT IT

IS PREFERABLE TO FACE THE FACTS .  THEN HE ECHOED THE BOSS AGAIN .

WHEN BRITAIN CAN ACCEPT ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE TREATY OF ROME,

NOTHING CAN STOP HER FROM ENTERING THE COMMON MARKET .  BUT IT IS UPON

HER AND NOT ON US THAT THE BURDEN OF PROOF LIES .  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN

A LITTLE LATE IN THE DAY, BUT MANY AT THE TABLE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD

HAVE BEEN WONDERFUL HAD HEATH GIVEN IN ENTIRELY AT THIS POINT AND TAKEN

COUVE UP ON HIS OFFER WITH NO MORE HAGGLING .  BUT THE BRITON LIMITED

HIMSELF TO A DISPASSIONATE REBUTTAL .  "IT HAS BEEN CONTENDED," HE SAID

,"THAT BRITAIN IS NOT EUROPEAN ENOUGH .  THERE ARE MANY MILLIONS IN

EUROPE WHO KNOW PERFECTLY WELL HOW EUROPEAN BRITAIN HAS BEEN IN THE

PAST AND ARE GRATEFUL FOR IT ."  ADDED HEATH :"THE TRUTH IS THAT

SOME PEOPLE REGARDED THE NEGOTIATIONS AS BEING TOO CLOSE TO SUCCESS,

THOUGH THEY GAVE OTHER REASONS FOR BREAKING THEM OFF ."  WHEN HE

STOPPED SPEAKING, ALL THE DELEGATES CROWDED AROUND TO SHAKE HIS HAND

ALL BUT FRANCE'S MEN, WHO LEFT UNSMILING .  FIVE STATELESS ONES .  THE

COMMON MARKET AS IT NOW EXISTS OFFERS A SUPERB INSTRUMENT FOR DE

GAULLE'S STRONG HAND TO WIELD, EVEN THOUGH HE WAS CONTEMPTUOUS OF IT AT

THE START, AND DISMISSES THE EUROCRATS WHO WORK FOR IT AS LES APATRIDES,

THE STATELESS ONES . AFTER FIVE YEARS OF OPERATION ITS GROSS NATIONAL

PRODUCT STANDS AT $210 BILLION, AND INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION HAS SOARED

40 PER CENT . THE COMMON MARKET POURED ALMOST 80 MILLION TONS OF STEEL

LAST YEAR (COMPARED WITH THE U.S .'S 98 MILLION TONS), AND IS THE

WORLD'S SECOND LARGEST AUTOMOBILE MAKER . AS THE WORLD'S BIGGEST

TRADER, THE COMMON MARKET IS FIRST IN IMPORTS, SECOND ONLY TO THE

U.S . IN EXPORTS . SINCE 1958, IMPORTS FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD HAVE

RISEN 39 PER CENT, THOSE FROM THE U.S . A GIANT 59 PER CENT, THUS AIDING

WASHINGTON'S DESPERATE BALANCE-OF-PAYMENT PROBLEMS . THE QUESTION MOST

ASKED LAST WEEK WAS WHETHER THE OTHER FIVE WEST GERMANY, ITALY

AND THE BENELUX COUNTRIES WOULD PERMIT LE GRAND CHARLES TO MAKE

THE MARKET HIS DEVICE FOR POWER . WHAT DE GAULLE HAS DEMONSTRATED IS

THAT HE CAN BLACKBALL ANY NATION HE DOES NOT WANT IN THE COMMON

MARKET ("FRENCH SHOULDERS ARE BROAD ENOUGH TO BEAR THE BURDEN," SAID

A SPOKESMAN) . BUT DE GAULLE HAS YET TO SHOW THAT HE CAN REMAKE

EUROPE IN FRANCE'S IMAGE . BRITAIN AND THE U.S . ARE BETTING THAT HE

NEVER WILL . INDEED, THE UNANIMOUS OUTCRY FROM THE OTHER FIVE COMMON

MARKET NATIONS LAST WEEK WAS AMPLE TESTIMONY THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY

DETERMINED TO RESIST FRANCE'S GRASP FOR LEADERSHIP . LAST WEEK THE

FIVE ABRUPTLY FORCED POSTPONEMENT OF A SPECIAL MEETING OF THE COMMON

MARKET FINANCE MINISTERS CALLED BY THE FRENCH TO INVESTIGATE THE

EXTENT OF U.S . INVESTMENT IN EUROPE, A PET HATE OF DE GAULLE'S THESE

DAYS . THIS REBUFF DISTURBED FRENCH MINISTER OF FINANCE VALERY GISCARD

D'ESTAING NOT AT ALL . HE REPORTEDLY REMARKED THAT THE FIVE HAD MERELY

DEPRIVED HIM OF HIS DESSERT MEANING, PRESUMABLY, THAT FRANCE HAD

ALREADY ENJOYED THE BRITISH LION FOR BREAKFAST . THE FIVE HAVE ALSO

SHOWN SIGNS OF BLOCKING OTHER FRENCH PROJECTS, E.G ., ALGERIA'S

ASSOCIATION WITH THE SIX . SHARP DIVISIONS . BUT AS THE INITIAL AND

GENUINE ANGER DIMINISHED, THERE WAS A QUESTION WHETHER THE SMALLER

COUNTRIES, IN THEIR ANXIETY TO BRING BRITAIN IN AS A POLITICAL

COUNTERBALANCE TO FRANCE AND GERMANY, WOULD BE WILLING TO ENDANGER THE

COMMON MARKET ITSELF . THEIR ECONOMIES ARE SO DEPENDENT ON THE MARKET

AS A TRADING PARTNER THAT IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT ANY OF THEM WOULD BE

ABLE TO SEPARATE OUT THEIR OWN MARBLES TO TAKE THEM HOME .

IT IS WEST GERMANY'S SUPPORT THAT CHARLES DE

GAULLE NEEDS TO WIN THE WHIPHAND OVER EUROPE . HE HAD A STALWART

PARTNER IN 87-YEAR-OLD CHANCELLOR KONRAD ADENAUER, THE RHINELANDER

WHOSE LIFELONG DREAM HAS BEEN FRANCO-GERMAN RAPPROCHEMENT . AS IT

HAPPENED, ADENAUER ARRIVED IN THE ELYSEE PALACE LAST MONTH TO SIGN THE

TREATY OF FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION WITH FRANCE AT THE VERY TIME WHEN

DE GAULLE HAD SPRUNG HIS LARGE SCHEME ON EUROPE . BY ALL ACCOUNTS,

ADENAUER DID NOT FULLY REALIZE THAT THE DOCUMENT HE HAD SIGNED WAS THE

REINFORCING SEAL OF DOOM FOR BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP IN EUROPE AND THAT HE

WAS NOW PUT AT ODDS WITH THE U.S . SCHEME OF THINGS . AT THE CEREMONY

IN PARIS, ADENAUER GENTLY ASKED DE GAULLE NOT TO FORCE THE GERMANS INTO

THE AWKWARD POSITION OF CHOOSING BETWEEN THE U.S . AND FRANCE . TUT,

TUT, REPLIED DE GAULLE REASSURINGLY, "FRANCE HAS NO INTENTION OF

PUTTING GERMANY INTO A POSITION WHERE SUCH A CHOICE WOULD BE NECESSARY .

DESERVED WHIPPINGS . WHATEVER KONRAD ADENAUER DESIRES, HE IS NO

LONGER UNDISPUTED MASTER AT HOME . WITH ECONOMICS MINISTER (AND

POSSIBLE NEXT CHANCELLOR) LUDWIG ERHARD THREATENING TO RESIGN IF THE

ADENAUER-DE GAULLE TREATY IS RATIFIED BEFORE CONCESSIONS ARE GRANTED IN

THE COMMON MARKET, WEST GERMANY'S SUPPORT FOR LE GRAND CHARLES IS IN

JEOPARDY INDEED . ALREADY LEADERS OF OPPOSITION FACTIONS IN THE

BUNDESTAG HAVE WARNED THAT THEY WOULD BLOCK RATIFICATION OF THE

FRANCO-GERMAN TREATY . IT WAS A MEASURE OF DE GAULLE'S RAPID RISE OF

PRESTIGE THAT ALL THE GERMAN PAPERS POSED THE MATTER AS A QUESTION OF

CHOOSING BETWEEN THE U.S . AND FRANCE . MOST, UNDERSTANDABLY, CHOSE THE

U.S . THE INFLUENTIAL PROTESTATION IN WASHINGTON RESTS ON ITS FIRM

LOYALTY TO AN AMERICAN-LED NATO . THE AMERICANS WILL SOONER OR LATER

WITHDRAW FROM THE CONTINENT IF THEY GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THE FEDERAL

REPUBLIC FAILED TO OPPOSE DE GAULLE'S INTENTION TO UNDERMINE NATO FROM

WITHIN .

SIBYLLINE DELIGHTS . LE FIGARO'S GIFTED COMMENTATOR

RAYMOND ARON, WHOSE ADMIRATION FOR DE GAULLE IS QUALIFIED, REMARKED

LAST WEEK THAT HE IS CONVINCED THAT THE GENERAL TAKES "LONELY PLEASURE

IN THE SPECTACLE OF THE ARGUMENTS HE CAUSES ." WHAT DISTURBS MANY

AMERICANS IS NOT DE GAULLE'S EFFORT TO ASSERT A REVIVING CONTINENT'S

STRENGTH, BUT HIS FUTURE PLANS FOR EUROPE . AND WHAT DISTURBS MANY

CONTINENTALS IS DE GAULLE'S READINESS TO BE FAR MORE DISREGARDING OF

THEIR SENSIBILITIES THAN THE U.S . HAS BEEN . A DE GAULLE AGREEMENT TO

CONSULT, AS ADENAUER AND OTHERS HAVE FOUND OUT, MEANS HIS WILLINGNESS

TO GIVE THE OTHER PARTNER AN AUDIENCE TO HEAR DE GAULLE'S INTENTIONS .

DE GAULLE ACCEPTS THE COMMITMENTS FRANCE ENTERED INTO WHILE HE WAS NOT

IN POWER, BUT DISTORTS THEM TO FRANCE'S ADVANTAGE . AFTER VETOING

BRITAIN, DE GAULLE LAST WEEK INVITED DANISH PREMIER JENS OTTO KRAG TO

JOIN THE COMMON MARKET EITHER AS FULL MEMBER OR AS ASSOCIATE AN

INVITATION THAT THE OTHER FIVE MEMBERS INDIGNANTLY THOUGHT WAS THE

RESPONSIBILITY OF ALL SIX TO EXTEND . KRAG'S OWN SURPRISED REACTION WAS

TO SAY THAT DENMARK'S HOPES WERE "BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT BRITAIN

WOULD JOIN THE COMMON MARKET ." SIMILARLY, THE OTHER PARTNERS WERE

SUSPICIOUS OF DE GAULLE'S INTENSE SIDE CULTIVATION OF SPAIN LAST WEEK,

AND HIS LONG PRIVATE TALKS WITH SOVIET AMBASSADOR SERGEI VINOGRADOV,

WHO IN THE YEARS DE GAULLE WAS NOT IN POWER KEPT UP HIS CLOSE CONTACTS

WITH HIM . LAST WEEK FRANCE SIGNED A BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT WITH

RUSSIA, CALLING FOR A 10 PER CENT INCREASE IN TRADE BETWEEN THE TWO

POWERS . WILL DE GAULLE TAKE IT UPON HIMSELF TO NEGOTIATE SEPARATELY

WITH THE SOVIET UNION ? HIS ANTI-COMMUNIST BONA FIDES HAS BEEN AMPLY

PROVED BY HIS STANDS ON BERLIN AND CUBA, WHEN HE FIRMLY BACKED KENNEDY .

THERE IS A STORY THAT, IN 1941, WHEN HITLER INVADED RUSSIA, DE GAULLE

TOLD AN AIDE, " NOW WE MUST BEGIN THINKING OF STOPPING THE COMMUNIST

PUSH IN EUROPE . " THE AIDE PROTESTED THAT THE PROSPECT SEEMED REMOTE,

AND DE GAULLE REPLIED, " REMEMBER THESE HOURS . I OFTEN MAKE MISTAKES

IN WHAT I DO, BUT NEVER IN WHAT I PREDICT . " ACTS, NOT WORDS . IN

TALKING TO HIS FRIENDS, DE GAULLE MAKES IT PLAIN THAT HE THINKS THE

SITUATION BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE WEST .

HE ARGUES THAT THE SINO-SOVIET SPLIT, THE ECONOMIC PULL OF WESTERN

EUROPE, THE GRADUAL " BOURGEOISATION " OF RUSSIA ALL CONTRIBUTE TO

TURNING THE COMMUNISTS, AND ESPECIALLY THE EASTERN EUROPEAN SATELLITES,

WESTWARD . AND OUT OF THIS HE CONCEIVES OF SOME KIND OF EUROPEAN

ARRANGEMENT, NEVER FULLY DEFINED, " STRETCHING FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE

URALS . " HOLDING THIS VISION, DE GAULLE HAS NEVER RULED OUT

NEGOTIATION WITH MOSCOW HE MERELY SETS THE CONDITION THAT THE RUSSIANS

MUST FIRST PROVE THEMSELVES IN ACTS, NOT WORDS . THOSE WHO FEAR DE

GAULLE'S INTENTIONS WONDER WHETHER HE WILL AT SOME FUTURE MOMENT

CONSIDER A DISENGAGEMENT IN EUROPE IN WHICH THE 400,000 U.S . TROOPS

WOULD GO HOME IN RETURN FOR A RUSSIAN PULL-OUT OF EASTERN EUROPE . THIS

MAY BE ONE REASON WHY HE WANTS HIS OWN NUCLEAR FORCE .

NO ONE IN THE WORLD, PARTICULARLY NO ONE

IN AMERICA, CAN SAY WHETHER, WHERE, WHEN, HOW AND TO WHAT EXTENT

AMERICAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS WILL BE USED IN DEFENSE OF EUROPE . " AND, HE

ARGUES, " IT IS INTOLERABLE FOR A GREAT STATE THAT HER FATE BE LEFT TO

THE DECISIONS AND ACTION OF ANOTHER STATE, HOWEVER FRIENDLY SHE MAY BE

. " IT IS A POWERFUL POINT, AND IS NOT FULLY MET BY OFFERING U.S .

NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO A EUROPEAN NATO GROUP, SINCE THE FINAL DECISION TO

LAUNCH ANY BOMBS WOULD STILL PRESUMABLY BE IN U.S . HANDS . PURGED

BRITAIN . TIME WAS WHEN THE U.S . CALLED THE TUNE ON SUCH CRUCIAL

QUESTIONS . DE GAULLE'S DRAMATIC ACTION RAISES THE QUESTION WHETHER THE

U.S . CAN, OR SHOULD, CONTINUE TO DO SO INDEFINITELY . IN HIS FINAL

WORDS TO HIS COMMON MARKET PARTNERS, FRANCE'S COUVE DE MURVILLE

SOMBERLY EXPRESSED DE GAULLE'S THOUGHTS ON THE MATTER . " I WILL SAY

ONCE AGAIN THAT WE ARE NOT SEEKING TO MAINTAIN A LARGE OR SMALL EUROPE,

BUT TO KNOW IF THE EUROPE WE ARE CREATING IS A EUROPEAN EUROPE . " IN

EFFECT, HE SEEMED TO BE SAYING : IF BRITAIN ONE DAY TRULY PURGED

ITSELF OF ITS CLOSE AMERICAN CONNECTION, IT MIGHT PROVE ITSELF ELIGIBLE

AT LAST, IN CHARLES DE GAULLE'S EYES, FOR COMMON MARKET MEMBERSHIP .

IRRITATING AS IT MIGHT BE, IT WAS AN IDEA WITH SOME FORCE . SO

SYMPATHETIC A TRANSATLANTIC FIGURE AS BRITAIN'S VISCOUNT HAILSHAM,

SPEAKING IN MANHATTAN FORTNIGHT AGO, GENTLY WARNED PRESIDENT KENNEDY

NOT TO THINK THAT HE IS THE " COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE FORCES OF THE

FREE WORLD . " IN FACT, SAID LORD HAILSHAM, " THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT HE

IS NOT IF THE ALLIES TO WHICH HE IS BOUND ARE NOT TO BE DEPRIVED OF THE

VERY INDEPENDENCE FOR WHICH THEY ARE PREPARED TO UNITE . " THE

SUPERIORITY IN NUMBERS, WEALTH AND STRENGTH, AND THEREFORE IN INFLUENCE

AND INITIATIVE, OF THE U.S., IS NOT IN QUESTION . NOR IS ITS INTEGRITY

. . . (BUT) HAVE THE AMERICANS PAUSED TO REFLECT THAT AN ALLIANCE IN

WHICH ALL THE ADVANCED AND SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGIES WERE LEFT TO ONE

OF THE PARTNERS, AND THE REST WERE RELEGATED TO SUPPLY A COMPLEMENT OF

CONVENTIONAL ARMS IN WAR, AND IN COMMERCE A MODEST CONTRIBUTION OF

SCOTCH WHISKY AND COMPACT CARS . . . WOULD NOT ULTIMATELY SUCCEED IN

RETAINING THE LOYALTY OF EUROPEAN ELECTORS ?

AS A WRITER, CHARLES

DE GAULLE HAS THE GIFT OF CLARITY, AS A POLITICIAN HE KNOWS THE USES OF

AMBIGUITY, AND AS A STATESMAN HE HAS SHOWN REMARKABLE CONSISTENCY .

FROM NEARLY 30 YEARS OF WRITINGS AND REMARKS COME THESE AFFIRMATIONS OF

HIS ASPIRATIONS AND AMBITIONS : ON NATO ALLIANCES DO NOT SETTLE

EVERYTHING . (1963) THE GLORY OF FRANCE OUR COUNTRY, WITH HER TINTED

SKY, HER VARIED CONTOURS, HER FERTILE SOIL, OUR FIELDS FULL OF FINE

CORN AND VINES AND LIVESTOCK, OUR INDUSTRY, OUR GIFTS OF INITIATIVE,

ADAPTATION AND SELF-RESPECT, MAKE US, ABOVE ALL OTHERS, A RACE CREATED

FOR BRILLIANT DEEDS . THE SWORD IS THE AXIS OF THE WORLD, AND GREATNESS

CANNOT BE SHARED . (1934) . THE EMOTIONAL SIDE OF ME TENDS TO

IMAGINE FRANCE, LIKE THE PRINCESS IN THE STORIES OR THE MADONNA IN THE

FRESCOES, AS DEDICATED TO AN EXALTED AND EXCEPTIONAL DESTINY . BUT THE

POSITIVE SIDE OF MY MIND ALSO ASSURES ME THAT FRANCE IS NOT REALLY

HERSELF UNLESS IN THE FRONT RANK ; THAT ONLY VAST ENTERPRISES ARE

CAPABLE OF COUNTERBALANCING THE DIVISIVE FERMENTS WHICH ARE INHERENT IN

HER PEOPLE . IN SHORT, TO MY MIND, FRANCE CANNOT BE FRANCE WITHOUT

GREATNESS . (2955) . WHO IN GOOD FAITH CAN DISPUTE THE FACT

THAT FRANCE MUST HELP TO BUILD WESTERN EUROPE INTO AN ORGANIZED UNION

OF STATES SO THAT GRADUALLY THERE MAY BE ESTABLISHED THE MOST POWERFUL,

PROSPEROUS AND INFLUENTIAL POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND MILITARY COMPLEX IN

THE WORLD ? (1962) FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE URALS THE EQUILIBRIUM OF

EUROPE, THE GUARANTEE OF PEACE ALONG THE RHINE, THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE

VISTULA, DANUBE AND BALKAN STATES, THE CREATION OF SOME FORM OF

ASSOCIATION WITH THE PEOPLES ALL OVER THE WORLD TO WHOM WE HAVE OPENED

THE DOORS OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION, AN ORGANIZATION OF NATIONS WHICH

WILL BE SOMETHING MORE THAN AN ARENA FOR DISPUTES BETWEEN AMERICA AND

RUSSIA THESE SURELY ARE OUR GREAT INTERESTS IN TOMORROW'S WORLD .

(1944) . PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO RENEW FRANCO-RUSSIAN

SOLIDARITY IN SOME FASHION, WHICH, EVEN IF REPEATEDLY BETRAYED AND

REPUDIATED,

REMAINS NO

LESS A PART OF THE NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS BOTH WITH REGARD TO THE

GERMAN DANGER AND THE ANGLO-SAXON EFFORTS TO ASSERT THEIR HEGEMONY .

(1944) . I AM CONVINCED THAT IF FRANCE TOOK THE INITIATIVE TO

SUMMON EUROPE TO ORGANIZE ITSELF, IN PARTICULAR WITH GERMAN HELP, THE

WHOLE EUROPEAN ATMOSPHERE FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE URALS WOULD BE

CHANGED . (1950) THE AMERICANS IN THE MORTAL DANGERS WE FRENCH HAVE

SURVIVED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE CENTURY, THE U.S . HAS NOT GIVEN US

THE IMPRESSION THAT IT REGARDS ITS OWN DESTINY AS LINKED WITH THAT OF

FRANCE, THAT IT WISHES FRANCE TO BE GREAT AND STRONG, THAT IT IS DOING

ALL IT CAN TO HELP HER TO REMAIN OR BECOME SO ONCE AGAIN . (1945) .

THE ALLIANCE HAS BEEN BUILT ON THE BASIS OF INTEGRATION, IN

WHICH THE DEFENSE OF EACH OF THE COUNTRIES OF CONTINENTAL EUROPE, APART

FROM ENGLAND, HAS NO NATIONAL CHARACTER, IN WHICH IN FACT ALL IS

COMMANDED BY THE AMERICANS, AND IT IS THE AMERICANS WHO DETERMINE THE

USE OF YOUR ATOMIC WEAPONS . (1960) . THE AMERICAN INTEREST IS

NOT ALWAYS THE FRENCH INTEREST . THIS WILL BE MORE AND MORE TRUE IN THE

FUTURE, WHICH WILL GIVE EUROPE A GREATER AND GREATER WEIGHT, AND WHICH

WILL THEREFORE CONTRIBUTE TO DIMINISHING THE RELATIVE WEIGHT OF THE U.S

. (1963) . FOLLOWING BRITAIN, OTHER STATES WOULD WANT TO ENTER

THE COMMON MARKET . IN THE END THERE WOULD APPEAR A COLOSSAL ATLANTIC

COMMUNITY UNDER AMERICAN DEPENDENCE AND LEADERSHIP, WHICH WOULD SOON

COMPLETELY SWALLOW UP THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY . (1963) BRITAIN & EUROPE

ENGLAND AND FRANCE WILL TOGETHER CREATE PEACE, AS TWICE IN 30 YEARS

THEY HAVE TOGETHER CONFRONTED WAR . (1944) . ENGLAND HAS

TURNED OVER TO THE AMERICANS WHAT MEAGER ATOMIC FORCES SHE HAD . SHE

COULD HAVE TURNED THEM OVER TO EUROPE . THUS SHE HAS MADE HER CHOICE .

I AM DISTRESSED TO SEE ENGLAND ALIGN HERSELF WITH THE U.S., FOR SHE

RISKS ACTING LIKE THEIR TRAVELING SALESMAN . THE ENGLISH WILL NO DOUBT

ENTER THE COMMON MARKET, PERHAPS IN 50 YEARS, AND I WILL WITHOUT DOUBT

NO LONGER BE HERE . (1963) THIRD FORCE I HAVE SOUGHT TO ASSURE FRANCE

PRIMACY IN WESTERN EUROPE BY PREVENTING THE RISE OF A NEW REICH THAT

MIGHT AGAIN THREATEN ITS SAFETY ; TO COOPERATE WITH EAST AND WEST AND,

IF NEED BE, CONTRACT THE NECESSARY ALLIANCES ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER

WITHOUT EVER ACCEPTING ANY KIND OF DEPENDENCY ; TO PERSUADE THE STATES

ALONG THE RHINE, THE ALPS AND THE PYRENEES TO FORM A POLITICAL,

ECONOMIC AND STRATEGIC BLOC ; TO ESTABLISH THIS ORGANIZATION AS ONE OF

THE THREE WORLD POWERS AND, IF NECESSARY, AS THE ARBITER BETWEEN THE

SOVIET AND ANGLO-AMERICAN CAMPS . SINCE 1940, MY EVERY WORD AND DEED

HAS BEEN DEDICATED TO ESTABLISHING THESE POSSIBILITIES . (1955) .

ONLY FRANCE KNOWS THAT PEACE OR WAR WILL BE DECIDED IN EUROPE

. YES, IT IS EUROPE, IT IS ALL EUROPE THAT WILL DECIDE THE DESTINY OF

THE WORLD . IF THE PEOPLES OF EUROPE, ON WHICHEVER SIDE OF THE CURTAIN

THEY FIND THEMSELVES, WANT TO ESTABLISH CONCORD AMONG THEMSELVES, THEN

PEACE WILL BE ASSURED . BUT IF EUROPE REMAINS DIVIDED IN TWO OPPOSED

FACTIONS, WAR WILL SOONER OR LATER DESTROY THE HUMAN RACE . (1959) .

WHO CAN SAY WHAT TOMORROW WILL BRING ? WHO CAN SAY THAT, IN

THE FUTURE, IF THE POLITICAL BACKGROUND SHOULD CHANGE COMPLETELY, THE

TWO POWERS (THE U.S . AND RUSSIA) THAT HAVE THE NUCLEAR MONOPOLY WILL

NOT AGREE TO DIVIDE THE WORLD ? WHO CAN SAY THAT IF THE OCCASION

ARISES, EACH OF THE TWO, WHILE DECIDING NOT TO LAUNCH ITS MISSILES AT

THE MAIN ENEMY, SO THAT IT MIGHT ITSELF BE SPARED, WILL NOT CRUSH THE

OTHERS ? IT IS POSSIBLE TO IMAGINE THAT, ON SOME AWFUL DAY, WESTERN

EUROPE WOULD BE WIPED OUT FROM MOSCOW AND CENTRAL EUROPE FROM

WASHINGTON . AND WHO CAN EVEN SAY THAT THE TWO RIVALS, AFTER I KNOW NOT

WHAT POLITICAL UPHEAVAL, WILL NOT UNITE ? (1959) ON LEADERSHIP GLORY

GIVES HERSELF ONLY TO THOSE WHO HAVE ALWAYS DREAMED OF HER . (1934) .

IT WAS BY ACTING AS THE INFLEXIBLE CHAMPION OF THE NATION AND

THE STATE THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR ME TO GATHER THE CONSENT, EVEN THE

ENTHUSIASM, OF THE FRENCH, AND TO WIN FROM FOREIGNERS RESPECT AND

CONSIDERATION . THOSE WHO WERE OFFENDED BY THIS INTRANSIGENCE WERE

UNWILLING TO SEE THAT FOR ME THE SLIGHTEST WAVERING WOULD HAVE BROUGHT

COLLAPSE . LIMITED AND ALONE THOUGH I WAS, I HAD TO CLIMB TO THE

HEIGHTS AND NEVER THEN TO COME DOWN . (1940, DESCRIBING HIS WARTIME

LEADERSHIP) . EVERY MAN OF ACTION HAS A STRONG DOSE OF

EGOTISM, PRIDE, HARDNESS AND CUNNING . BUT ALL THOSE THINGS WILL BE

FORGIVEN HIM IF HE CAN MAKE OF THEM THE MEANS TO ACHIEVE GREAT ENDS .

ALOOFNESS, CHARACTER, AND THE PERSONIFICATION OF GREATNESS, THESE

QUALITIES IT IS THAT SURROUND WITH PRESTIGE THOSE WHO ARE PREPARED TO

CARRY A BURDEN WHICH IS TOO HEAVY FOR LESSER MORTALS .

CAMBODIA THE MAN WHO WOULDN'T BE KING ONCE HE DREAMED OF

GOING TO HOLLYWOOD AS THE " CAMBODIAN CHARLIE CHAN . " THEN HE TOOK UP

THE SAXOPHONE AND MADE LIKE " CANNONBALL " ADDERLEY, BELTING OUT SUCH

COMPOSITIONS OF HIS OWN AS LOVE WITHOUT HOPE . HE SUPPORTED A TROUPE OF

30 DANCING GIRLS AND A STRING OF 20 THOROUGHBREDS AND WORKED DILIGENTLY

TO IMPROVE THE BREED . SPORTS ARE HIS LATEST CRAZE . HE CAPTAINS A

CHAMPIONSHIP VOLLEYBALL TEAM AND RECENTLY DUNKED IN 92 POINTS IN A

BASKETBALL GAME . ECCENTRIC AND MERCURIAL HE MAY BE, BUT CAMBODIA'S

PRINCE NORODOM SIHANOUK, 41, IS ALSO ONE OF THE SHREWDEST LEADERS IN

SOUTHEAST ASIA . SIHANOUK WAS CAMBODIA'S YOUNG KING UNTIL 1955, WHEN HE

STEPPED DOWN FROM THE THRONE TO RUN FOR ELECTIVE OFFICE IN THE

GOVERNMENT, BECAUSE THE " TRUE FACE OF THE PEOPLE WAS HIDDEN FROM ME .

/ UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP, CAMBODIA HAS EMBARKED ON AN AMBITIOUS PROGRAM

OF DEVELOPMENT . LAST YEAR THE RICE CROP WAS THE BEST IN MEMORY, AND A

RECORD EXPORTABLE SURPLUS OF 400,000 TONS WAS PREDICTED . CAMBODIA DOES

NOT HAVE ONE RIEL OF EXTERNAL DEBT, AND ITS CURRENCY IS 100 PER CENT

COVERED BY GOLD AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE (V . 50 PER CENT IN THE U.S.) ;

25 PER CENT OF THE BUDGET IS SPENT ON EDUCATION, ONE OF THE HIGHEST

PERCENTAGES IN THE WORLD . " SOCIALIST MAJESTIES . " BUT CAMBODIA, LIKE

MANY PLEASANT AND LANGUID PLACES, IS NOW BESET BY PRESSING ECONOMIC

PROBLEMS . THE PLANNED $26 MILLION DEFICIT FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR HAS

UNEXPECTEDLY DOUBLED, AND THE GOVERNMENT IS SO SHORT OF CASH THAT THE

CURRENT FIVE YEAR PLAN IS LITERALLY OUT OF MONEY . SOME $24 MILLION

WORTH OF PUBLIC PROJECTS HAVE HAD TO BE CANCELED, AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RESERVES ARE DWINDLING AT THE RATE OF $1,500,000 A MONTH . SIHANOUK'S

REACTION WAS CHARACTERISTICALLY UNPREDICTABLE ; HE PURGED HIS

GOVERNMENT OF ITS OLDTIMERS AND INSTALLED IN THEIR PLACES A GROUP OF

HIS MOST FIERY CRITICS . THEY ARE YOUTHFUL (AVERAGE AGE : 36),

LEFT-WING, PARIS-TRAINED INTELLECTUALS WHOM SIHANOUK SNEERINGLY CALLS "

THEIR SOCIALIST MAJESTIES . " SAYS SIHANOUK : " I KNOW THAT THEY DO

NOT LIKE ME . THEY HATE ME . THEY HAVE ALWAYS SUPPORTED THE COMMUNISTS

. NOW I'VE GIVEN THEM THE OPPORTUNITY OF SUPPORTING CAMBODIA FOR THE

FIRST TIME . I TOLD THEM, " YOU CAN KILL ME, BUT YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO

KILL CAMBODIA . " ' WHAT'S GOOD FOR G . M . . . . BEHIND SIHANOUK'S ODD

CHOICE OF MINISTERS IS AN ADROIT POLICY . WITH OPPONENTS IN HIS VERY

CABINET, SIHANOUK IS ABLE TO KEEP AN EYE ON HIS FOES, AND TO FORCE THEM

TO SHARE BLAME FOR A WORSENING FINANCIAL SITUATION . HE HAS ALLOWED THE

CABINET TO SLASH GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES, BUT VETOED ITS PROPOSAL TO

NATIONALIZE THE FRENCH RUBBER PLANTATIONS, WHICH ARE A PRIME SOURCE OF

FOREIGN EXCHANGE . " THE FRENCH MIGHT BE CAPITALISTS, " SIHANOUK SAID,

/ BUT THEY ARE CAPABLE . " HE ALSO DELIGHTS IN POINTING OUT TO HIS

LEFT-LEANING INTELLECTUALS THE FAILURE OF CAMBODIA'S RED CHINESE-BUILT

FACTORIES . " THEY ONLY COST US MONEY, " SIHANOUK SAYS . " I TELL MY

CABINET THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT FORD OR GENERAL MOTORS WOULD DO . " THOUGH

HE DEALS ROUGHLY WITH CAMBODIA'S NATIVE COMMUNISTS, SIHANOUK ARTFULLY

REFUSES TO JOIN EITHER THE COMMUNIST OR WESTERN CAMPS . HOPING TO KEEP

HIM NEUTRAL, THE U.S . HAS WEIGHED IN WITH $300 MILLION IN ECONOMIC AID

SINCE 1955, TO THIS NATION OF 5,700,000 PEOPLE, AND RUSSIA HAS BUILT A

500-BED HOSPITAL AND SENT INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT . CURRENTLY, NEUTRALIST

SIHANOUK LEANS TOWARD MORE WESTERN INFLUENCE IN HIS COUNTRY, FOR HE

FEELS THAT A COUNTERBALANCE IS NEEDED AGAINST THE RISING STRENGTH OF

THE COMMUNISTS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA . BUT THE MAIN OBJECT OF SIHANOUK'S

POLICY IS STILL TO " MAINTAIN THE JOIE DE VIVRE OF MY PEOPLE . I WANT

THEM TO WORK ALSO, BUT NOT SO HARD AS COMMUNISTS . WE CAMBODIANS ARE

NOT ANIMALS OR MACHINES . WE HAVE TO REMAIN GAY AND FREE . WE MUST BE

ALLOWED TO HAVE THE GOOD THINGS . /

THE CONGO BARE CUPBOARD AWAITING THE VICTORIOUS UNITED NATIONS

AT THE NATIONAL BANK OF KATANGA IN ELISABETHVILLE WERE SOME LEGITIMATE

FRANCS ORIGINALLY DEPOSITED IN THE BANK TO SUPPORT THE CURRENCY OF

THE CONGO

GOVERNMENT FOR RECONSTRUCTION . BUT WHEN THEY GOT THERE, TSHOMBE'S

CUPBOARD WAS BARE . FOR WEEKS, THE BANK'S DIRECTORS HAD REFUSED TO OPEN

THEIR FILES AND STRONGROOMS TO U.N . INVESTIGATORS, AND NOW THE REASON

FOR THEIR RELUCTANCE WAS CLEAR . MOST OF THE RECORDS WERE GONE, AND

MOST OF THE CASH . ALL THE U.N . FOUND WAS $116.28 IN FOREIGN CURRENCY

ABOUT ENOUGH TO PAY A CONGOLESE ARMY SUB-LIEUTENANT FOR TEN DAYS . IT

WAS NOT DIFFICULT TO GUESS WHERE THE MONEY WENT . TSHOMBE'S OWN

KATANGESE OFFICIALS HAD WITHDRAWN HUGE SUMS OF MONEY WITHOUT TROUBLING

TO LEAVE RECEIPTS . ONE UNNAMED OFFICIAL WALTZED OFF WITH 133 MILLION

KATANGESE FRANCS (WORTH $2,660,000 AT THE OFFICIAL EXCHANGE RATE OF 50

TO $1) IN A SINGLE SWIPE . SOME 4,000 GOLD COINS VALUED AT $280,000

WERE SMUGGLED TO GENEVA FOR SALE BY A EUROPEAN SYNDICATE . THERE WAS

EVIDENCE THAT THE BANK HAD TRANSFERRED 1 BILLION FRANCS TO A BRANCH 150

MILES AWAY IN NDOLA, NORTHERN RHODESIA, TO BUY ARMS AND PAY MERCENARIES

. WITH THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IN LEOPOLDVILLE ALREADY FACING A 1963

DEFICIT OF $100 MILLION, THE LOOTING OF THE BANK WAS A SAD BLOW . IT

WAS ALSO BAD NEWS TO THE U.S., WHICH HAS ALREADY RESIGNED ITSELF TO

DONATING ANOTHER HEFTY SUBSIDY TO THE CONGOLESE . LAST WEEK A U.S . AID

TEAM HEADED BY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE HARLAN CLEVELAND FLEW INTO

GROUND FROM AN AIRBORNE ACCIDENT . AT LEAST 62 PEOPLE ON THE STREETS

WERE KILLED, AND OF ANOTHER 120 HOSPITALIZED, TEN WERE NOT EXPECTED TO

SURVIVE . EIGHT OF THE DEAD LOST THEIR LIVES FROM HUGE HUNKS OF HOT

METAL PLUNGING THROUGH THE ROOFS OF THEIR HOMES . FOUR PEOPLE IN A TAXI

JAPAN GETTING THERE IS NOT MUCH FUN " I WOULDN'T MIND " SAID THE

ANXIOUS HOUSEWIFE AT THE ATAMI STATION OF JAPAN'S NATIONAL RAILWAYS, "

LOST-AND-FOUND WAREHOUSES BULGE WITH AN INVENTORY THAT WOULD DO A

CLOTHING, RANGING FROM GARTER BELTS TO GREATCOATS, FOUR URNS CONTAINING

HUMAN ASHES (PRAYED OVER DAILY BY REVERENT WAREHOUSE EMPLOYEES), AN

ELECTRIC MOTOR, ONE PINBALL MACHINE, FALSE TEETH, AND SEVERAL FALSE

EYEBALLS . ONLY 15 PER CENT OF THE ITEMS ARE RECLAIMED . BY AUCTIONING

WESTERN EUROPE ROUND 1 TO THE GENERAL IF MOST OF EUROPE

SEEMED ANGRY AT CHARLES DE GAULLE LAST WEEK, NO ONE SEEMED TO KNOW

QUITE WHAT TO DO ABOUT HIM . SPEAKER AFTER SPEAKER AT THE EUROPEAN

PARLIAMENT IN STRASBOURG RINGINGLY CONDEMNED CHARLES DE GAULLE'S

IMPERIOUS THUMBS DOWN ON BRITISH MEMBERSHIP IN THE COMMON MARKET . AS A

RESULT, DECLARED COMMON MARKET CHAIRMAN WALTER HALLSTEIN, THE SIX HAVE

BEEN PLUNGED INTO THEIR " FIRST REAL CRISIS A CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE . "

IN EUROPEAN CAPITALS FROM BONN TO ROME, FRANCE'S COMMON MARKET PARTNERS

SPOKE BRAVELY OF GANGING UP ON DE GAULLE, PERHAPS BY BLOCKING HIS PLANS

FOR ASSOCIATING FRANCE'S FORMER AFRICAN COLONIES WITH EUROPE, OR EVEN

BY BOYCOTTING FRENCH GOODS . EMPTY CHAIR ? BUT WHEN THE SPEECHES WERE

OVER, EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTARIANS SPEECHLESSLY REALIZED THAT THERE WAS

ALMOST NO CONCRETE ACTION THAT THEY COULD TAKE AGAINST LE GRAND CHARLES

. DE GAULLE SEEMED TO HOLD ALL THE TRUMPS . SOME MEMBERS OF THE OTHER

COMMON MARKET FIVE HAD TALKED OF GIVING FRANCE THE " EMPTY-CHAIR "

TREATMENT, CARRYING ON THEIR EFFORTS FOR EUROPEAN UNITY AND ATLANTIC

PARTNERSHIP WITHOUT THE FRENCH . YET WHAT PURPOSE WOULD IT SERVE TO

EXCLUDE FRANCE FROM NATO COUNCILS ? NONE AT ALL . ITS CONTRIBUTIONS

TO ALLIED FIGHTING STRENGTH ARE SUFFICIENTLY MEAGER IT IS TWO DIVISIONS

BEHIND ITS COMMITMENTS IN GERMANY, IT WITHHOLDS ITS MEDITERRANEAN FLEET

FROM NATO, KEEPS MOST OF ITS METROPOLITAN TERRITORY OUT OF THE AIR

WARNING SYSTEM, AND EVEN PROHIBITS FOREIGN NUCLEAR WEAPONS ON FRENCH

SOIL . STILL, SHEER GEOGRAPHY GIVES FRANCE A VETO ON NATO PLANNING .

COULD FRANCE BE IGNORED IN THE TARIFF DISCUSSIONS OF THE 40-ODD MEMBERS

OF GATT, OR IN OECD, THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COORDINATING GROUP THAT GREW

OUT OF THE MARSHALL PLAN ? HARDLY, SINCE THE ECONOMIES OF ALL WESTERN

EUROPEAN NATIONS ARE INTERTWINED WITH FRANCE'S . THE URGENT FRENCH NEED

TO EXPORT FOOD SURPLUSES, AND ITS BOOMING MARKET FOR OTHER NATIONS'

INDUSTRIAL GOODS, ARE THE STICK AND THE CARROT THAT HAVE GIVEN THE

COMMUNITY MUCH OF ITS MOMENTUM . EVEN BELGIUM'S PAUL-HENRI SPAAK,

PERHAPS THE MOST IMPLACABLE FOE OF DE GAULLE'S PLANS FOR EUROPE, AGREED

LAST WEEK THAT THERE WAS NO GENERAL SUPPORT FOR RETALIATORY MEASURES

AGAINST FRANCE . WEST GERMANY'S ECONOMICS MINISTER LUDWIG ERHARD, WHO

WAS IN TEARS AT BRUSSELS WHEN FRANCE BLACKBALLED BRITAIN, WENT HOME

BREATHING DEFIANCE OF DE GAULLE AND THREATS TO TOPPLE KONRAD ADENAUER

NOWHERE (SEE BELOW) . AND AFTER ALL THE ORATORY AT STRASBOURG, A "

SOLEMN PROTEST " MOTION CONDEMNING DE GAULLE'S " DOMINATION " OF EUROPE

WAS IGNOMINIOUSLY DEFEATED BY A TIE VOTE OF 38-38 HARDLY A RESOUNDING

GESTURE OF DEFIANCE . PERSONALITY CHANGE . BY THEIR VERY LACK OF

PASSION AT THE NEW REALITIES, EUROPEAN STATESMEN PROVED THAT THERE IS

STILL A LOT OF LIFE IN DEEP-ROOTED NATIONALISM, WHETHER DE GAULLE'S OR

ANYONE ELSE'S . THE COMMUNISTS HAD FOUND OUT THE SAME THING IN

YUGOSLAVIA, POLAND, HUNGARY AND EAST GERMANY . THERE WERE DIFFERENCES

: RUSSIA HAD TRIED TO IMPOSE A UNITY, AND WESTERN EUROPEANS HAD HOPED

TO EVOLVE INTO A UNITY BY DEMOCRATIC MEANS AND FOR MUTUAL BENEFIT .

WESTERN EUROPEANS STILL INSIST THAT THE IDEA OF EUROPE WILL CARRY THE

DAY, BUT AT THE MOMENT THERE IS A NEW CONSCIOUSNESS OF ONE ANOTHER'S

DISPARATE TASTES, TALENTS AND DESTINIES . THE FRENCH, AWARE OF THE

HOSTILITY OF ALLIES, WERE REASSURING EVERYBODY THAT THEY WERE NOT

PROPOSING TO GO IT ALONE . FOREIGN MINISTER COUVE DE MURVILLE SAID : "

IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF FREEING THE EUROPEAN PERSONALITY BUT OF

REMAINING INSIDE THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE . " EVEN SO, EUROPE'S

PERSONALITY HAD UNDOUBTEDLY UNDERGONE A CHANGE . SAID ONE MINISTER IN

BRUSSELS LAST WEEK : " FOR THE PRESENT, ONLY EXPECT THE THINGS TO BE

DONE QUICKLY AROUND HERE THAT ARE PLAINLY GOOD FOR ALL THE SIX

COUNTRIES . IT WILL BE QUIT A WHILE BEFORE WE HEAR A MINISTER IN

COUNCIL SAY HE IS VOTING FOR ANYTHING FOR THE GOOD THE COMMUNITY AS A

FRANCE SPARKS ACROSS THE CHANNEL FOR A MAN SO INSISTENT ON

HAVING HIS OWN SENSIBILITIES TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT, CHARLES DE GAULLE HAS

A GARGANTUAN CAPACITY FOR BEING INDIFFERENT TO EVERYONE ELSE'S . LAST

WEEK, HAVING STOOD FRANCE'S FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS ON THEIR EARS, DE

GAULLE TRIUMPHANTLY SURVEYED THE SCENE FOR THE BENEFIT OF SOME 120

NEWLY ELECTED NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEPUTIES IN A RECEPTION AT ELYSEE

PALACE . DE GAULLE, WHOSE ATTITUDE TOWARD ECONOMICS IS VAGUE AT BEST,

LOFTILY EXPLAINED TO THE DEPUTIES WHY THE U.S . WANTED BRITAIN IN THE

COMMON MARKET : " THE AMERICANS ARE GIVING AWAY THEIR PRODUCTS TO THE

SOUTH AMERICANS, THE AFRICANS, AND EVEN THE ARABS . THEREFORE THEY MUST

TRY TO SELL THEM IN EUROPE, WHICH CAN PAY FOR THEM . " THIS WAS WILDLY

INACCURATE : U.S . SALES TO JAPAN AND CANADA ALONE IN 1962 TOTALED

ALMOST TWICE AS MUCH AS ITS $3.6 BILLION IN EXPORTS TO THE COMMON

MARKET . WITH BRITAIN'S EXCLUSION, SAID LE GRAND CHARLES, THE U.S . IS

NOW " MAKING USE OF ENGLAND " TO CREATE " A VAST NEW TRADE THINGAMAJIG

WITH THE IRISH, THE ICELANDERS, AND SO FORTH . " THEN DE GAULLE TURNED

HIS REMARKS TO THE WEST GERMANS, FOR WHOM HE HAD SOME ADVICE ON HOW TO

GOVERN THEMSELVES . " WHAT IS NEEDED IN GERMANY, " HE DECLARED, " IS A

CONSTITUTION THAT WOULD PERMIT IT TO FACE MODERN CONDITIONS . "

(GERMANY'S CONSTITUTION WAS DRAFTED AND ADOPTED IN 1949.) CHANGE OF

TONE . DE GAULLE'S MOST DERISIVE COMMENTS WERE AIMED AT HAROLD

MACMILLAN AND HIS COUNTRYMEN, WHO " ALWAYS MANAGE TO SEEM SO

RESPECTABLE . " DESCRIBING THE PRIME MINISTER'S TALKS WITH HIM AT

RAMBOUILLET LAST DECEMBER, HE RELATED : " MR . MACMILLAN CAME TO TELL

ME WE WERE RIGHT IN MAKING OUR FORCE DE FRAPPE . " WE HAVE OUR OWN,

TOO,' HE TOLD ME . " WE SHOULD TRY TO ASSOCIATE THEM IN A EUROPEAN

FRAMEWORK INDEPENDENT OF AMERICA.' ON THIS, HE LEFT ME FOR THE BAHAMAS

. " THERE, ACCORDING TO DE GAULLE, MACMILLAN BETRAYED HIM BY AGREEING

INSTEAD TO ACCEPT POLARIS FORCE FROM THE U.S . AND THEN TO COMMIT IT,

ALONG WITH BRITAIN'S OWN NEW NUCLEAR BOMBERS, TO A MULTINATIONAL NATO

NUCLEAR FORCE . SHRUGGING THAT THIS " NATURALLY CHANGED THE TONE " OF

THE JAN . 14 PRESS CONFERENCE AT WHICH DE GAULLE GUTTED BRITAIN'S HOPES

OF JOINING EUROPE, DE GAULLE ADDED TESTILY : " MR . MACMILLAN, WHOM I

LIKE, HAS HAD THE BRITISH PRESS COMPARE ME TO HITLER AND EVEN TO

NAPOLEON . " IN LONDON, IRATE BRITISH OFFICIALS WERE OFFENDED AT THE

IDEA THAT MACMILLAN COULD DICTATE FLEET STREET'S LINE, EVEN IF HE

WANTED TO . PERHAPS, THEY SUGGESTED ACIDLY, HE WAS CONFUSING BRITAIN'S

FREE PRESS WITH FRANCE'S, WHERE DE GAULLE'S SIDE PRONOUNCEMENTS AND

LITTLE WITTICISMS ARE FED TO THE PARIS PRESS BY THE PALACE GUARD . A

GREAT MANY TALKATIVE DEPUTIES HAD HEARD DE GAULLE'S COMMENTS AT HIS

PALACE RECEPTION, AND THE STATE-OWNED NEWS AGENCY HAD SENT THEM OUT ON

THE WIRE . NONETHELESS, WHEN THE REVERBERATIONS BEGAN, THE PALACE

GRANDLY ISSUED A WARNING THAT THE PUBLIC " ONCE AGAIN BE ON GUARD

AGAINST THE PUBLICATION OF SO-CALLED DECLARATIONS OF GENERAL DE GAULLE

. " SEVEN REASONS . IN LONDON, BRITISH OFFICIALS PRODUCED THEIR OWN

MINUTES OF THE RAMBOUILLET TALKS, WHICH CONTAINED NO HINT THAT

MACMILLAN HAD EVER PROPOSED A DETERRENT " INDEPENDENT OF AMERICA . "

THE PRIME MINISTER, THEY SAID, HAD INDEED AGREED THAT DE GAULLE SHOULD

PUSH AHEAD WITH HIS FORCE DE FRAPPE, BUT HAD POINTEDLY EXPRESSED HIS

HOPES THAT IT WOULD EVENTUALLY BE ASSIGNED TO NATO . SNAPPED ONE

OFFICIAL : " THE FRENCH HAVE NOW GIVEN SEVEN DIFFERENT REASONS WHY DE

GAULLE TURNED DOWN BRITISH MEMBERSHIP . THE ONLY THING THEY HAVEN'T

CLAIMED YET IS THAT IT WAS BECAUSE SCOTLAND BEAT FRANCE 11-6 AT RUGBY .

/ THE REAL REASON WHY DE GAULLE VETOED BRITAIN, RETORTED FOREIGN

SECRETARY LORD HOME, WAS THAT " TWO VISIONS OF EUROPE HAD COME INTO

HEAD-ON COLLISION . ONE WAS OF EUROPE SO ORDERED THAT IT WOULD BE A

THIRD FORCE, PROTECTED, EXCLUSIVE, NARCISSUS-LIKE IN ITS SELF-GLORY .

THE OTHER, A EUROPE OF EQUAL, POLITICALLY MATURE NATIONS IN COMPLETE

PARTNERSHIP WITH AMERICA AND DOING THEIR DUTY BY THE WHOLE WORLD

OUTSIDE . " WITH ANGLO-FRENCH RELATIONS IN SUCH AN IRRITABLE STATE,

CLOSEST FRIEND AND MOST LOYAL DISCIPLE, AND ALIVE ONLY BECAUSE KASSEM

COMMUTED HIS 1959 DEATH SENTENCE . UNSHARED PRIZE . TO KASSEM THE COUP

MUST HAVE SEEMED ONLY TOO FAMILIAR . IN THE SAME WAY BACK IN 1958,

KASSEM SEIZED POWER BY RUTHLESSLY SLAUGHTERING KING FEISAL II AND HIS

IRON-FISTED, PROWESTERN PREMIER, NURI AS-SAID, WHO WAS CAUGHT TRYING TO

ESCAPE THE CITY DRESSED IN WOMEN'S CLOTHES . IN THOSE DAYS KASSEM WAS A

ACTUALLY, HE WAS LEADER OF A GROUP OF ARMY CONSPIRATORS INCLUDING

MERCURIAL COLONEL ABDUL SALAM AREF, A PASSIONATE PRONASSERITE . AFTER

THE YOUNG KING WAS SLAIN, KASSEM APPOINTED HIMSELF PREMIER,NAMED AREF

STANDARDS OF OUR POPULATION AND SAVING THEM FROM LIVING IN SLUMS .

TWO FRIENDS & BROTHERS EVEN THOUGH AREF DEVOTEDLY DECLARED, /

I AM KASSEM'S SON, " AND BACHELOR KASSEM FONDLY CALLED AREF " MY SON,

AREF'S OTHER HERO, EGYPT'S NASSER . ORDERED INTO EXILE AS AMBASSADOR TO

WEST GERMANY, AREF PULLED A GUN IN KASSEM'S PRESENCE BUT WAS DISARMED

AND FINALLY CONDEMNED TO DEATH AS A TRAITOR . KASSEM CHANGED THE

SENTENCE TO LIFE IMPRISONMENT AND IN 1961 SENTIMENTALLY AND IMPRUDENTLY

ATTACKS FROM NASSER'S RADIO CAIRO, KASSEM EAGERLY ACCEPTED THE SUPPORT

OF IRAQ'S WELL-ORGANIZED COMMUNIST PARTY, WANGLED $800 MILLION IN ARMS

AND ECONOMIC AID FROM THE SOVIET BLOC, AND VOTED THE COMMUNIST LINE IN

THE UNITED NATIONS . SPARTAN COT . KASSEM'S BRIEF REGIME READS LIKE A

CASE HISTORY IN DANGEROUS LIVING . HE SAVAGELY PUT DOWN ONE ABORTIVE

REVOLT, NARROWLY ESCAPED DEATH IN AN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT IN WHICH HIS

ARM AND HAND WERE SHATTERED BY BULLETS . UNDERSTANDABLY GUN-SHY, HE

SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME INSIDE THE DEFENSE MINISTRY BUILDING, WHERE HE

SLEPT ON A SPARTAN COT AND WATCHED SUSPICIOUSLY FOR TROUBLE . THERE WAS

PLENTY OF THAT . HALF OF IRAQ'S ARMY WAS TIED DOWN BY A REBELLION OF

THE KURDISH TRIBESMEN NORTH AND EAST OF MOSUL . KASSEM BEGAN TO GROW

SUSPICIOUS OF IRAQ'S COMMUNISTS ; AFTER A SERIES OF RED-INSPIRED

STRIKES, KASSEM JAILED HUNDREDS OF REDS AND CONDEMNED TO DEATH 28

COMMUNIST LEADERS . AND ALWAYS HE HAD TO FEAR DISAFFECTION IN HIS OWN

ARMY . HE WAS PROMISING EVEN GREATER ARMY PURGES WHEN LAST WEEK THE

REBELS STRUCK . AFTER MORE THAN TEN HOURS OF HARD FIGHTING, THE DEFENSE

MINISTRY WAS IN RUINS AND KASSEM'S DISHEARTENED DEFENDERS SURRENDERED .

KASSEM WAS ALIVE, BUT ONLY FOR A LITTLE WHILE . THE REBEL IRAQI RADIO

ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD BEEN " TRIED " ON THE SPOT, CONDEMNED AND, AT 90

MINUTES PAST NOON THE NEXT DAY, STOOD AGAINST A WALL AND EXECUTED . AT

THE MOMENT (THOUGH VICTORIES ARE OFTEN PERISHABLE IN ARAB POLITICS),

THE REVOLT SEEMED AN IMPRESSIVE TRIUMPH FOR EGYPT'S NASSER, EVEN IF HE

HAD NO DIRECT HAND IN IT . IF SO, THERE WOULD BE TROUBLE FOR THE

HARD-PRESSED KINGS OF JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA, AS WELL AS FOR THE

BRITISHPROTECTED SHEIKS OF THE PERSIAN GULF . " KASSEM HAS GONE ; SOON

KINGS SAUD AND HUSSEIN WILL GO TOO, " SAID A COMPLACENT EGYPTIAN IN

CAIRO . BUT FIRST, NASSER'S SUPPORTERS WERE CONFIDENT THAT THE IRAQI

COUP WOULD SET OFF A SUCCESSION OF UPRISINGS IN NEIGHBORING SYRIA,

WHICH HAS ALREADY PUT DOWN TWO PRO-NASSER REVOLTS SINCE BREAKING OFF

FROM EGYPT IN 1961 .

WEST GERMANY WAITING FOR THE CALL ECONOMICS MINISTER LUDWIG

ERHARD, THAT PUDGY AND POPULAR FELLOW, HAS BEEN ITCHING TO GET HIS

HANDS ON THE TOP JOB IN WEST GERMANY, AND CAN HARDLY WAIT FOR

CHANCELLOR KONRAD ADENAUER TO RETIRE AS PROMISED NEXT FALL . HE HAS

SHYLY NUDGED DER ALTE BEFORE, ONLY TO BE RAPPED HARSHLY ON THE KNUCKLES

. LAST WEEK ERHARD PUFFED UP HIS CHEST AND TRIED AGAIN . TO A MUNICH

NEWSPAPER, LUDWIG DECLARED HIS WILLINGNESS TO TAKE OVER RIGHT NOW . " I

WOULD BE READY TO ACCEPT A CALL TO THE CHANCELLORSHIP IF MY PARTY AND

THE BUNDESTAG SO DECIDED, " HE ANNOUNCED, CLEARLY HOPING THAT OTHERS

FELT AS HE DID . AFTER ALL, MANY OF WEST GERMANY'S RESTIVE POLITICIANS

HAD BEEN GRUMBLING OVER CHARLES DE GAULLE'S COURTSHIP OF DER ALTE,

WONDERING WHETHER THE PRICE OF GERMANY'S NEW FRIENDSHIP TREATY WITH

FRANCE WAS AN UNACCEPTABLE SUBSERVIENCE TO FRANCE, AND WHETHER IT

REQUIRED SIDING WITH THE FRENCH AGAINST BOTH BRITAIN AND THE U.S . NO

SUPPORT . BUT WHEN ERHARD SAT BACK TO LISTEN FOR THE EXPECTED CRIES OF

SUPPORT, THERE WAS NOTHING BUT SILENCE . HE HAD OVERREACHED HIMSELF .

AT THE FIRST CABINET MEETING AFTER ERHARD GAVE OUT HIS

READINESS-TO-SERVE INTERVIEW, KONRAD ADENAUER SIMPLY SMILED AND AGREED

WITH EVERY COMPLAINT POOR LUDWIG COULD THINK OF . WOULD THE CHANCELLOR

FLATLY ENDORSE BRITAIN'S ENTRY INTO THE COMMON MARKET ? HE DEMANDED .

OF COURSE, ADENAUER AGREED BLANDLY . WOULD ADENAUER DECLARE THAT NATO

AND CLOSE RELATIONS WITH THE U.S . WERE THE BASIS OF BONN'S DIPLOMACY

? NATURALLY, SMILED DER ALTE . THEN CAME THE CLANGER . WOULD ADENAUER

DISASSOCIATE HIMSELF FROM DE GAULLE'S IDEAS OF CREATING A THIRD FORCE

BETWEEN EAST AND WEST ? SNAPPED DER ALTE : OF COURSE NOT, NO NEED

FOR IT . DE GAULLE HAD NEVER EVEN DISCUSSED SUCH THOUGHTS WITH HIM ;

BESIDES, WEST GERMANY IS OPPOSED TO SUCH A POLICY . RUNNING OUT OF

STEAM AND QUESTIONS ERHARD LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM FOR SUPPORT FROM

FOREIGN MINISTER GERHARD SCHRODER AND DEFENSE MINISTER KAI-UWE VON

HASSEL . THEY, LIKE ERHARD, ARE PROBRITISH, AND LIKE ERHARD, HAVE GRAVE

RESERVATIONS ABOUT ADENAUER'S COMRADESHIP WITH DE GAULLE . BUT NEITHER

WAS PREPARED TO BRING DOWN THE GOVERNMENT ; SCHRODER FOUND A SUDDEN

FASCINATION IN HIS THUMBNAILS ; VON HASSEL SHUFFLED PAPERS . NEGLECTED

CONSCIENCE . NEXT DAY, AT A CAUCUS OF THE RULING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS

AND THEIR ALLIES, ADENAUER CHIDED ERHARD MERCILESSLY FOR PRESUMING TO

SEEK CONTROL OF THE GOVERNMENT . WHEN THE CABINET FINALLY VOTED ON

ADENAUER'S DEMAND THAT THE FRANCO-GERMAN PACE BE RATIFIED IMMEDIATELY,

ERHARD'S NEIN WAS OVERWHELMINGLY DEFEATED . FOR THE CHANCELLOR, THERE

WAS NOW ONLY THE BUNDESTAG TO BE DEALT WITH . KONRAD ADENAUER, 87,

HANDLED THE SITUATION WITH DEFT EASE . THE FRANCO-GERMAN TREATY " IS

NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR EUROPEAN INTEGRATION, " HE TOLD THE ASSEMBLED

LEGISLATORS . " IT IS MERELY ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL PREREQUISITES . " AS

A MATTER OF FACT, DECLARED DER ALTE, DE GAULLE " PROMISED ME THAT THE

FIRST SUBJECT OF JOINT CONSULTATION AFTER THE TREATY GOES INTO EFFECT

WILL BE BRITISH ENTRY " INTO THE COMMON MARKET . AS FOR THE ATLANTIC

ALLIANCE, " EUROPE KNOWS THAT IT CANNOT DEFEND ITSELF WITHOUT THE

SUPPORT OF THE UNITED STATES . I UNDERLINE AGAIN OUR REPEATEDLY

EXPRESSED INTENTION OF ORGANIZING OUR DEFENSE IN THE FRAMEWORK OF NATO

/ LUDWIG ERHARD SAT SILENT THROUGHOUT ADENAUER'S PERFORMANCE, SHOWED NO

EMOTION EVEN WHEN DER ALTE TURNED TO THE ECONOMIC MATTERS WHICH ARE

ERHARD'S SPECIALITY AND SAID : " CHANCELLOR ERHARD WILL . . . I MEAN

MINISTER ERHARD . . . " BOTH SIDES OF THE HOUSE DISSOLVED IN LAUGHTER AS

ADENAUER PERMITTED HIMSELF A RARE GRIN . " MALICIOUS CRITICS WILL THINK

I DID THAT ON PURPOSE, " HE SAID . " BUT I ASSURE YOU I DID NOT . WELL,

MAYBE HAVING A LAUGH IN THE MIDDLE OF SUCH A BORING GOVERNMENT

STATEMENT IS A GOOD THING . " AT WEEK'S END, ERHARD WAS RIGHT WHERE HE

HAD ALWAYS BEEN, GROPING FOR THE TOP RUNG OF THE LADDER . AND KONRAD

ADENAUER WAS IN HIS ACCUSTOMED PLACE ON TOP .

SKRIPOV DID NOT KNOW WAS THAT MISS X HAD BEEN WORKING FOR AUSTRALIAN

INTELLIGENCE ALL ALONG, AND SHE SIMPLY TURNED THE PARCEL OVER TO

GOVERNMENT AGENTS . INSIDE THEY FOUND CODED TRANSMISSION TIMETABLES FOR

A SOVIET RADIO STATION, ALONG WITH A SMALL, HIGH-SPEED RADIO MESSAGE

TORTURE IN A BRUTAL NONSTOP INTERROGATION . LATER, THE PAINTER'S TWO

SONS-IN-LAW CLAIMED THAT HE WAS PLAYING CARDS WITH THEM AT THE TIME OF

THE ROBBERY . ONLY TWO OF THE 40 EYEWITNESSES OF THE CRIME POSITIVELY

IDENTIFIED HIRASAWA AS THE ROBBER AND BOTH WERE INCREASINGLY UNSURE AS

THE TRIAL WORE ON . THE ONLY CLUE POINTING TO HIRASAWA WAS THE CALLING

CARD OF THE SUPPOSED HEALTH INSPECTOR, WHICH THE ROBBER HAD LEFT BEHIND

NAME ON THE WORLD'S FRONT PAGES . A SMALLISH, DARK-SKINNED MAN WITH

GENTLE EYES AND A FRINGELIKE BEARD, HE LED HIS RIFF TRIBESMEN IN THE

LAST ROMANTIC WAR OF THIS CENTURY . IN THE U.S., THE VISION OF KRIM'S

SNOW-WHITE TURBAN, FLOWING DJELLABAH AND SPIRITED ARABIAN STEED WAS PUT

TO MUSIC BY SIGMUND ROMBERG IN BROADWAY'S THE DESERT SONG . IN NORTH

AFRICA, HIS TENACIOUS STRUGGLE AGAINST THE ARMIES OF FRANCE AND SPAIN

SENT A THROB OF NATIONALISM THROUGH THE ARAB WORLD . CLOSED CAVE . BORN

IN THE RIFF MOUNTAINS OF NORTHERN MOROCCO, EDUCATED AT A SPANISH SCHOOL

IN MELILLA, A QUIET EMPLOYEE OF THE SPANISH MOROCCAN ADMINISTRATION

UNTIL HE WAS 38, KRIM BECAME A REBEL WHEN THE SPANISH BROKE THE PEACE

WITH THE RIFF TRIBESMEN BY SEIZING THE HOLY CITY OF XAUEN . IN THE

SUBSEQUENT FIGHTING, KRIM WAS CAPTURED AND HIS FATHER KILLED . ESCAPING

FROM THE SPANISH PRISON IN MELILLA KRIM BROKE HIS LEG AND EVER AFTER

WALKED WITH A PRONOUNCED LIMP . GAINING THE SAFETY OF THE MOUNTAINS, HE

RALLIED THE RIFFS FOR A JIHAD AGAINST SPAIN AND IN 1921 WON AN

EXTRAORDINARY VICTORY AT ANOUAL, CAPTURING A SPANISH GENERAL AND 20,000

SOLDIERS MOST OF WHOM WERE BUTCHERED ON THE SPOT . IN THE NEXT FOUR

YEARS, KRIM REPEATEDLY WHIPPED THE SPANIARDS AND NEARLY DROVE THEM INTO

THE SEA . WHEN KRIM DECLARED THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE RIFF AND NAMED

HIMSELF SULTAN, SPAIN SET UP A PUPPET RULER OF ITS OWN, THE REDOUBTABLE

MOROCCAN BANDIT RAISULI. KRIM PROMPTLY SCATTERED ANOTHER SPANISH ARMY,

SEIZED RAISULI AND SHUT HIM UP IN A CAVE WITH HIS HAREM UNTIL HE DIED .

ARROGANT IN VICTORY, KRIM NEXT CHALLENGED THE FRENCH AND WAS FINALLY

OVERWHELMED BY A COMBINED FRANCO-SPANISH ARMY OF 300,000 MEN LED BY

MARSHAL HENRI PETAIN, WHICH BLASTED HIS MOUNTAIN STRONGHOLDS WITH

ARTILLERY AND BOMBS UNTIL KRIM AT LAST SURRENDERED IN MAY 1926 . THE

SPANISH ARMY, ONE OF WHOSE OFFICERS WAS GENERALISSIMO FRANCISCO FRANCO,

WANTED KRIM EXECUTED, BUT THE FRENCH MOR GALLANTLY SHIPPED HIM OFF TO

EXILE ON REUNION ISLAND IN THE INDIAN OCEAN . THERE, CONSOLED BY HIS

TWO FAVORITE WIVES AND A MONTHLY PENSION . KRIM

LANGUISHED FOR 21 YEARS . IN 1947 FRANCE RELENTED AND LET KRIM BOARD A

SHIP FOR THE RIVIERA, WHERE HE WOULD BE UNDER HOUSE ARREST . THE

65-YEAR-OLD REBEL JUMPED SHIP AS IT WAS PASSING THROUGH THE SUEZ CANAL,

AND WAS GRANTED POLITICAL ASYLUM IN EGYPT . SPURNED FORTUNE . IN CAIRO,

UNDER NASSER'S PROTECTION, KRIM WORKED WITH OTHER NORTH AFRICAN EXILES

FOR THE INDEPENDENCE OF TUNISIA, ALGERIA AND MOROCCO . BUT HE WAS

DISGUSTED BY THE TERMS ON WHICH FREEDOM WAS WON ; HE CLAIMED THEY WERE

CENTRAL AFRICA TROUBLE BREWING CUSTOMS AGENTS AND SPECIAL BRANCH

DETECTIVES CHARGED WITH SAFEGUARDING THE BORDERS OF THE SPRAWLING

RHODESIAN FEDERATION HAVE BEEN RUN RAGGED LATELY . IN THE NORTH, THERE

IS A STEADY TRAFFIC OF WHITE MERCENARIES AND AFRICAN SOLDIERS FROM THE

ROUTED KATANGESE ARMY, WHO SLIP ACROSS THE CONGO LINE TO PEDDLE THEIR

WEAPONS TO EAGER WHITE AND BLACK RHODESIANS WHO MAY ONE DAY USE THEM ON

EACH OTHER . IN THE EAST, SMUGGLERS FROM THE PORTUGUESE COLONY OF

MOZAMBIQUE MAKE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE WILD, MOUNTAINOUS BUSH TO BRING

WHISPERED, " MAN, WHAT DOES A HOP LOOK LIKE ? NO ONE HERE HAS EVER

SEEN ONE ! " THE HOP CRISIS RESULTS FROM A $28 DUTY ON EVERY POUND OF

IMPORTED HOPS IMPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF SIR ROY WELENSKY BECAUSE TAX

REVENUE FROM COMMERCIAL BEER HAS NOT BEEN UP TO EXPECTATIONS . " THIS

IS DUE TO THE SPREAD OF HOME BREWING, " COMPLAINED THE GOVERNMENT .

HOME BREWERS ARE GENERALLY RESPECTABLE CITIZENS, RANGING FROM RAILROAD

ENGINEERS AND CIVIL SERVANTS TO BANK CLERKS AND GARAGE MECHANICS MEN

WHO FIND COMMERCIAL BEER TOO EXTRAVAGANT FOR THEIR BUDGETS . THE NEW

DUTY WOULD MAKE HOME BREW TWICE AS COSTLY AS THE COMMERCIAL STUFF .

VINTNERS ASSOCIATION, SOME 300 DO-IT-YOURSELF BRAUMEISTERS FIRED OFF A

PROTEST TO WELENSKY, POINTING OUT THAT HOME BREWING " HAS TAKEN PLACE

THE COLONIES, THIS TRADITION HAS BEEN ACCEPTED AS THE BIRTHRIGHT OF THE

FRANCE'S CLAIM TO DOMINATE WESTERN EUROPE AND TO BE RECKONED WITH AS

THE LEADER OF A THIRD FORCE IS ALSO THE LENGTHENING EXTENSION OF THAT

MAN . THOSE OF HIS ALLIES WHO HAVE TO DEAL WITH LE GRAND CHARLES

SOMETIMES FIND THAT THEIR EXASPERATION EXCEED THEIR ADMIRATION . BUT

ANY WAY ONE LOOKS AT IT, WHETHER AS AN ALLY OR AS A FRENCHMAN WORRYING

ABOUT THE CHAOS THAT MIGHT FOLLOW HIS DEATH, THERE IS A LOT RIDING ON

THE TOWERING MAN IN THE ELYSEE PALACE . HE IS 72, AND HE HAS ENEMIES

DESPERATE ENOUGH TO WANT TO KILL HIM . LAST WEEK, AS FRENCHMEN CLOSELY

FOLLOWED THE NEWS OF A TRIAL OF WOULD-BE ASSASSINS OF DE GAULLE, THE

GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED A FRESH ATTEMPT ON DE GAULLE'S LIFE . ARMORED CAR

. THE NIGHT BEFORE DE GAULLE WAS TO INSPECT THE ECOLE MILITAIRE ON THE

LEFT BANK NEAR THE EIFFEL TOWER, PARIS GENDARMES SWARMED OVER THE

GROUND, SEARCHING THE BUILDINGS FOR WEAPONS AND INTERROGATING OFFICER

STUDENTS AND TEACHERS . DE GAULLE SHOWED UP NEXT DAY ON SCHEDULE, BUT

(IN A CONCESSION TO DANGER RARE FOR HIM) COOPED UP INSIDE AN ARMORED

CITROEN LIMOUSINE WITH BULLETPROOF WINDOWS . ACCORDING TO THE OFFICIAL

STORY FROM SURETE HEADQUARTERS ON THE RUE DES SAUSSAIES, POLICE HAD

DISCOVERED A PLOT ON A CIVILIAN'S TIP, IN THE NICK OF TIME . AFTER

INTERROGATING THE FIVE SUSPECTS, THE POLICE INDICATED THAT THE

TRIGGERMAN WAS NAVY CAPTAIN ROBERT POINARD, 37, WHO WAS HELD FOR

QUESTIONING ALONG WITH HIS BLONDE YOUNG WIFE . ACCORDING TO THE POLICE

SUPPOSITION, CAPTAIN POINARD WAS TO USE A CARBINE WITH A TELESCOPIC

SIGHT TO KILL DE GAULLE WHILE HE WAS INSPECTING THE HONOR GUARD IN THE

COBBLED ECOLE MILITAIRE COURTYARD . TWO OTHER OFFICERS WERE ALSO IN

CUSTODY, BUT THE ODDEST OF THE SUSPECTS WAS THE ALLEGED RINGLEADER, MME

. PAULE ROUSSELOT DE LIFFIAC, 55, A PIPE-SMOKING, LOW-SALARIED ENGLISH

TRANSLATOR AT THE SCHOOL, THE MOTHER OF SIX CHILDREN, WHO WAS PICKED UP

AT HER 15-ROOM, 18TH CENTURY CHATEAU IN A TOWN SOUTH OF LYON . THE

ECOLE MILITAIRE, WHERE NAPOLEON LEARNED TO SOLDIER, IS THE TOP ACADEMY

FOR THE FRENCH MILITARY, AND A HOTBED OF ANTIGAULLISM AMONG THE

VETERANS OF ALGERIA WHO THINK HE LET THEM DOWN . SHREWD DELAY . ALGERIA

WAS A WORD MUCH SPOKEN ALSO IN A COURTROOM IN SUBURBAN VINCENNES, WHERE

NINE WOULD-BE ASSASSINS WERE ON TRIAL FOR HAVING TRIED TO KILL DE

GAULLE LAST AUGUST IN AN AMBUSCADE AT PETIT-CLAMART, A PARIS SUBURB .

AS HAS SO OFTEN HAPPENED IN FRANCE SINCE THE DREYFUS CASE OF THE 1890S,

THE TRIAL WAS NOT CONFINED TO PERTINENT EVIDENCE BUT BLOSSOMED INTO A

NATIONAL POLITICAL AFFAIR . VERY FEW FRENCHMEN HAD MUCH SYMPATHY FOR

THE DEFENDANTS, BUT MANY HAD GRAVE DOUBTS ABOUT HOW THEY WERE BEING

TRIED . DE GAULLE'S CHOSEN INSTRUMENT FOR THE TRIAL WAS THE SPECIAL

COURT OF MILITARY JUSTICE, FROM WHOSE VERDICT THERE IS NO APPEAL, WHICH

WAS SET UP LAST YEAR AND WAS TO END ITS EXISTENCE ON FEB . 25 . THE

DEFENDANTS' ATTORNEYS SHREWDLY TRIED TO DELAY PROCEEDINGS UNTIL THAT

DATE SO THAT THE CASE WOULD HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN IN A REGULAR

COURT, FROM WHICH APPEALS COULD BE TAKEN . BUT DE GAULLE MOVED TO FIT

THE LAW TO HIS NEEDS.HIS CABINET SWIFTLY APPROVED A BILL EXTENDING THE

LIFE OF THE SPECIAL COURT OF MILITARY JUSTICE, AND THE BILL WAS PASSED

BY DE GAULLE'S ASSEMBLY 271-170 (THE SENATE LAST WEEK STUBBORNLY VOTED

THE BILL DOWN BUT, LIKE BRITAIN'S HOUSE OF LORDS, IS POWERLESS TO

OVERTURN DECISIONS OF THE LOWER HOUSE .

THE DEFENDANTS AT VINCENNES WERE AN ODD,

AND ODDLY FRIGHTENING, LOT . MOST OF THEM WERE SLACK-JAWED YOUTHS WHO

SEEMED EQUALLY LACKING IN CONFIDENCE AND INTELLIGENCE . ONE WAS AN ARMY

LIEUTENANT WITH THE OLD, ARISTOCRATIC BRETON NAME OF BOUGRENET DE LA

TOCNAYE, AND A HEAD REELING WITH HEROIC MEMORIES OF HIS FAMILY'S FEATS

OF ARMS DATING BACK TO THE CRUSADES . THE LEADER, LIEUT . COLONEL

JEAN-MARIE BASTIEN-THIRY, 35, WHO HAD GRADUATED FROM THE FAMED

POLYTECHNIQUE AND SERVED AS A BRILLIANT AIR FORCE ENGINEER, REVEALED

HIMSELF AS A MAN WHO PUT GREAT INDUSTRY, INTELLIGENCE AND LOGIC TO WORK

WITHIN A FRAMEWORK OF MAD ZEAL . ALL NONSENSE . THOUGH REFUSING TO

RECOGNIZE THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT, BASTIEN-THIRY AGREED TO ANSWER

QUESTIONS, " BECAUSE IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE FRENCH PEOPLE TO KNOW WHY

WE HAVE ACTED AND HOW WE HAVE ACTED . " HIS STORY WAS FANTASTIC,

INCREDIBLE, AND THOROUGHLY FRENCH . TO BEGIN WITH, EXPLAINED

BASTIEN-THIRY, THE AMBUSH HAD NOT BEEN INTENDED TO KILL DE GAULLE, ONLY

TO CAPTURE HIM . TO THIS END, THE ASSASSINS WHO WERE ALL " CRACK SHOTS

/ HAD FIRED AT THE TIRES OF DE GAULLE'S CAR . AS A WITNESS FOR THE

PROSECUTION, DE GAULLE'S SON-IN-LAW, COLONEL ALAIN DE BOISSIEU, WHO WAS

RIDING BESIDE THE CHAUFFEUR, TESTIFIED THAT HE SAW A MAN POURING A

STREAM OF BULLETS AT THE CAR, AND RECALLED, " HE DID NOT SEEM TO BE

AIMING HIS SUBMACHINE GUN AT THE TIRES, BUT QUITE OBVIOUSLY AT THE

PASSENGERS . " TO THE CHAUFFEUR, BOISSIEU SNAPPED, " DOWN THE MIDDLE .

STRAIGHT AHEAD ! " THEN HE TURNED AROUND, BEGGED DE GAULLE, WHO WAS

STILL SITTING UPRIGHT, TO BEND DOWN . DE GAULLE OBLIGED BY LEANING

FORWARD SLIGHTLY . DEFENDANT BASTIEN-THIRY AIRILY DISMISSED AS "

TECHNICAL INCIDENTS " THE ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE THAT THE CAR WINDOWS WERE

SHATTERED BY BULLETS, A MOTORCYCLE COP'S HELMET DRILLED THROUGH, AND DE

GAULLE'S HEAD MISSED ONLY BY INCHES . IF THEY HAD CAPTURED DE GAULLE,

THE CONSPIRATORS INTENDED TO HIDE HIM AWAY IN A VILLA " BETWEEN PARIS

AND VERSAILLES, " AND PLANNED TO PREVENT HIS ESCAPING BY REMOVING HIS

SPECTACLES AND SUSPENDERS . AFTER SEVERAL WEEKS, DE GAULLE WOULD BE

TRIED BY THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF THE RESISTANCE (THE SUCCESSOR TO THE

ALGERIAN SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION), AND PRESUMABLY EXECUTED . WITH DE

GAULLE DISPOSED OF, THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF THE RESISTANCE PLANNED TO

APPOINT A NEW HEAD OF STATE : NONE OTHER THAN DE GAULLE'S PRESENT

FINANCE MINISTER VALERY GISCARD D'ESTAING . GISCARD D'ESTAING SAID IT

WAS ALL NONSENSE, THAT HE HAD NEVER EVEN MET BASTIEN-THIRY AND HAD NO

LINKS WITH EITHER THE SECRET ARMY OR THE COUNCIL OF THE RESISTANCE .

THE WILD RHETORIC OF THE DEFENDANTS COULD NOT CONCEAL THE IMPLACABLE

DETERMINATION TO KILL . LA GLOIRE SUMMONS FRENCHMEN IN MANY DIRECTIONS

. FIVE OF THE GUNMEN WHO TOOK PART IN THE PETIT-CLAMART AMBUSH ARE

STILL AT LARGE, INCLUDING THE MOST DANGEROUS OF ALL, GEORGES WATIN, 39,

NICKNAMED BOITEUX (THE LIMPER), WHO THE POLICE SAY WAS ALSO THE BRAINS

BEHIND THE ECOLE MILITAIRE PLOT . A FRENCH CABINET MINISTER, EMERGING

FROM A MEETING AT THE ELYSEE PALACE LAST WEEK, SAID WORRIEDLY TO A

FRIEND : " NEVER HAD DE GAULLE'S LIFE BEEN IN SUCH DANGER . /

IRAQ GREEN ARMBANDS, RED BLOOD A WEEK AFTER THE OVERTHROW

IRAQ'S DICTATOR ABDUL KARIM KASSEM, THE CRACK OF RIFLE FIRE STILL

ECHOED IN BAGHDAD'S LIBERATION SQUARE . TANKS AND ARMORED CARS KEPT

STERN VIGIL AT EVERY IMPORTANT INTERSECTION . SCURRYING EVERYWHERE WERE

THE LITTLE SQUADS OF MEN WEARING GREEN ARMBANDS FERRETS WHO SOUGHT TO

FIND AND TO CRUSH THE LAST REMAINING OPPOSITION TO REBEL PRESIDENT

ABDUL SALAM AREF AND HIS MYSTERIOUS REVOLUTIONARY BACKERS . WHO WERE

THESE NEW RULERS ? IN THE MODERN MODE, AREF, 41, GRITTED HIS TEETH

AND PRESENTED HIMSELF AT THE BAGHDAD HOTEL FOR THE INEVITABLE PRESS

CONFERENCE WITH THE SWARM OF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS, AN ORDEAL HE

SEEMED TO REGARD AS IN SOME WAYS WORSE THAN THE HISTORIC NIGHT OF THE

COUP ITSELF . MORE THAN A HUNDRED SHOUTING REPORTERS AND PHOTOGRAPHERS

PUSHED ASIDE HIS TOMMY-GUN-WAVING GUARD AND CROWDED AROUND IRAQ'S BOSS

TO HEAR AREF SPEAK FREELY ABOUT THE AIMS AND PURPOSES OF THE NEW

GOVERNMENT . HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT AN END TO ONE-MAN RULE, FRIENDSHIP

WITH ALL ARAB STATES, AND THE " OVERCOMING OF ALL THE DIFFICULTIES

FACING THE IRAQI PEOPLE . " BUT HE WAS MYSTERIOUSLY SILENT ABOUT THE

SIZE OR MEMBERSHIP OF THE ALL-POWERFUL NATIONAL COUNCIL OF THE

REVOLUTIONARY COMMAND, WHICH ORGANIZED AND LED THE REVOLT AGAINST

KASSEM . NO PERSONALITIES . SAID AREF : " THIS IS A SECRET WHICH MUST

REMAIN A SECRET FOR MANY REASONS . " ASKED WHY, ENGLISHSPEAKING AREF

REPLIED VOLUBLY IN ARABIC . PRESSED AGAIN FOR AN ANSWER, AREF SUDDENLY

ANNOUNCED, " THE CONFERENCE IS CLOSED, " AND DEPARTED, SURROUNDED BY

HIS GUARDS . THE REASON FOR SUCH SECRECY SEEMS TO BE A GENERAL

REVULSION AGAINST THE SELFGLORIFICATION OF KASSEM'S FOUR-YEAR

DICTATORSHIP . " WE REVOLTED AGAINST THE CULT OF PERSONALITY, "

EXPLAINED NEW FOREIGN MINISTER TALIB HUSSEIN SHABIB, 32 . TO THE KEY

QUESTION OF WHO IS BOSS OF THE NEW IRAQ, THE ANSWER SEEMS TO BE : AT

THE MOMENT, NO ONE MAN . PRESIDENT AREF CANNOT MAKE MAJOR DECISIONS

WITHOUT THE CONCURRENCE OF THE MYSTERIOUS NATIONAL COUNCIL . BUT HIGHLY

VISIBLE WAS THE NEW 21-MAN CABINET, AND MOST WESTERN OBSERVERS LIKED

WHAT THEY SAW . SAID ONE : " IN GENERAL, THEY'RE A TOPNOTCH BUNCH OF

RESPONSIBLE, EAGER, EXCEPTIONALLY WELL-EDUCATED PEOPLE . " MANY OF THE

MINISTERS HAVE LIVED OR HAVE BEEN EDUCATED IN THE WEST, RANGING FROM

FOREIGN MINISTER SHABIB, WHO GRADUATED FROM LONDON UNIVERSITY AND IS

MARRIED TO AN ENGLISHWOMAN, TO FINANCE MINISTER SALIH KUBBA, WHO

ATTENDED THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND HAS AN INTERNATIONAL

REPUTATION AS AN ECONOMIST . SEVEN OF THE NEW CABINET MINISTERS WERE IN

KASSEM'S CONCENTRATION CAMP AT RASHID MILITARY BASE UNTIL THE REBELS

BROKE DOWN THE GATES DURING THE COUP . THE BAATH IDEA . THE NEW

GOVERNMENT IS CLEARLY ANTI-COMMUNIST, AND ALL BUT FIVE MINISTERS ARE

EITHER MEMBERS OF OR CLOSELY LINKED TO THE BAATH (RENAISSANCE) PARTY .

MORE AN IDEA THAN AN IDEOLOGY, THE BASIC BAATH DOCTRINE INSISTS THAT "

THERE ARE NO ARAB NATIONS ; THERE IS ONLY ONE ARAB NATION . " THIS

CREED IS, OF COURSE, WARMLY EMBRACED BY EGYPT'S GAMAL ABDEL NASSER, BUT

AREF AND IRAQ'S BAATH PARTY SEEM HARDLY EAGER TO FALL UNDER CAIRO'S

DOMINATION . THE BAATHIST LEADERS IN IRAQ, IN FACT, HAVE RESHAPED THEIR

DOCTRINE OF ARAB UNITY INTO A CONCEPT OF FEDERATION OF ARAB STATES

WITHOUT A CENTRALIZED DICTATORSHIP . THIS COULD MEAN ANYTHING,

INCLUDING A REVIVAL OF THE OLD CONCEPT OF LOOSE UNITY IN THE " FERTILE

CRESCENT " IRAQ, SYRIA, JORDAN AND LEBANON . ALREADY SYRIA, HAVING

BROKEN FREE FROM NASSER, WAS PROPOSING FEDERATION TO IRAQ'S NEW LEADERS

. THE IDEAS OF THE NEW IRAQIS SEEM LIBERAL, HUMANE AND DEMOCRATIC . BUT

SO DID KASSEM'S PROGRAM WHEN HE FIRST SEIZED POWER ; HIS REIGN SWIFTLY

DRIFTED TO BRUTALITY AND DEGRADATION . NORMAL TORPOR . BY WEEK'S END

IRAQ SEEMED SETTLING DOWN INTO THE NORMAL TORPOR OF AN ARAB STATE AFTER

A COUP D'ETAT . OIL FLOWED UNINTERRUPTEDLY THROUGH THE PIPELINES TO THE

MEDITERRANEAN . SHOPS, SCHOOLS, AND GOVERNMENT OFFICES REOPENED . THE

CURFEW WAS GRADUALLY EXTENDED FROM 3 IN THE AFTERNOON UNTIL 11 AT

NIGHT, AND IN THE COFFEEHOUSES MEN WERE GOSSIPING AND PLAYING

BACKGAMMON .

THE LOCAL COMMUNISTS, THE

ONLY GROUP STILL SUPPORTING THE DISCREDITED KASSEM REGIME, WERE BEING

STRIDENTLY URGED BY MOSCOW'S POWERFUL ARABIC VOICE IN EAST GERMANY TO "

STRUGGLE AGAINST THE FASCIST IMPERIALIST REGIME NOW FOISTED ON IRAQ . "

SOME COMMUNISTS RESPONDED BY SNIPING FROM ROOFTOPS, BUT THEIR

ORGANIZATION HAD SUFFERED A DEVASTATING BLOW . HUNDREDS OF THE DOGGED

MEN WITH GREEN ARMBANDS, CARRYING MIMEOGRAPHED LISTS OF RED LEADERS

COMPLETE WITH HOME ADDRESSES AND AUTO LICENSE NUMBERS, METHODICALLY

HUNTED DOWN THE COMMUNISTS, WHO HAD GROWN STRONG IN KASSEM'S FINAL

MONTHS . BY LAST WEEK THE NEW REGIME HAD KILLED OR JAILED NEARLY 2,500

DISSIDENT COMMUNISTS . THIS WAS ENOUGH TO WIN THE APPLAUSE OF WESTERN

DIPLOMATS . BUT ANYONE WHO HAD WITNESSED THE PERILOUS PASSAGE OF OTHER,

EARLIER REVOLTS WITH LAUDABLE AMBITIONS, COULD ONLY HOPE THAT THE

REBELS WOULD STOP THE SHOOTING AND START RUNNING THE COUNTRY . IN THE

LONG RUN, GUNS WILL HARDLY SERVE THE NEW REGIME BETTER THAN THEY SERVED

ABDUL KARIM KASSEM .

GREAT BRITAIN 2-12 THE OTHER HAROLD THE LABOR PARTY LAST WEEK CHOSE A

NEW LEADER TO CARRY ITS BANNER AGAINST THE TORIES IN BRITAIN'S COMING

GENERAL ELECTION . THE WINNER : HAROLD WILSON, 46, A PIPE-SMOKING

INTELLECTUAL WITH A PHENOMENAL MEMORY, A FOLLOWING OF MIXED ADMIRERS,

AND A LOVE OF POLITICAL COMBAT . WILSON'S  VICTORY WAS A CRUSHING BLOW

TO HIS CHIEF RIVAL, COMRADELY GEORGE BROWN, 48, A STAUNCH TRADE

UNIONIST AND EX-TRUCK DRIVER, WHO AS ACTING PARTY LEADER SINCE THE

DEATH LAST MONTH OF HUGH GAITSKELL, HAD EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HE

WOULD INHERIT THE MANTLE OF LEADERSHIP . BUT WHEN THE VOTING BEGAN LAST

WEEK, IT WAS GEORGE BROWN'S OLD FRIENDS AMONG LABOR'S TRADE UNIONISTS

WHO ABANDONED HIM FIRST . SOME OPPOSED HIS PRO-COMMON MARKET VIEWS ;

OTHERS AMONG LABOR'S INTELLECTUAL CENTER AND RIGHT FLINCHED AT THE

THOUGHT OF A WORKINGCLASS, UP-FROM-THE-RANKS PRIME MINISTER, AND

PREFERRED TO GO TO THE COUNTRY WITH AN OXFORD GRADUATE AND ECONOMICS

DON LIKE WILSON . RESPECTABILITY MEANS A LOT TO THE LABOR PARTY . HIGH

MORTALITY . " NO ONE KNOWS HAROLD, REALLY, " SAYS A FRIEND . BUT AT A

PRESS CONFERENCE LAST WEEK, JAMMED WITH REPORTERS AND TV CAMERAS,

WILSON SET OUT SMOOTHLY AND COMPETENTLY TO LEAVE THE RIGHT IMPRESSION .

HE REGRETTED THE " TRAGIC EVENT " OF GAITSKELL'S DEATH " THAT CREATED

THIS VACANCY . " HE DIPLOMATICALLY DECLARED THAT " A GREAT DEAL OF

CREDIT MUST GO TO GEORGE BROWN " FOR KEEPING THE PARTY TOGETHER IN THE

INTERIM . FINALLY, WILSON STATED HIS THREE MAIN OBJECTIVES : " FIRST,

TO MAINTAIN THE UNITY OF THE PARTY THAT HUGH GAITSKELL HANDED ON ;

SECOND, TO CONTINUE THOSE POLICIES WORKED OUT UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP . . .

THIRDLY, TO LEAD THE PARTY TO VICTORY IN THE COMING GENERAL ELECTION .

/ IN THE PAST DECADE, LABOR'S STRENGTH HAS BEEN SAPPED BY INTERNAL

BICKERING AND BY THE LOSS OF MANY OF ITS ABLEST MEN (GAITSKELL, SIR

STAFFORD CRIPPS, ERNEST BEVIN, ANEURIN BEVAN) . THE FEUDING HAS FADED,

AND LABOR FINDS ITSELF IN THE BEST SHAPE IN YEARS TO TOPPLE THE

GOVERNMENT OF PRIME MINISTER HAROLD MACMILLAN . A GALLUP POLL LAST WEEK

INDICATED THAT LABOR HAD A 15F PER CENT LEAD OVER THE CONSERVATIVES,

THE LOWEST THE TORIES HAVE BEEN IN ELEVEN YEARS IN POWER . BEVERIDGE'S

BOY . DEEPENING UNEMPLOYMENT AND A FALTERING ECONOMY ACCOUNT MORE FOR

TORY UNPOPULARITY THAN ITS RECENT DEFEAT ON THE COMMON MARKET .

MACMILLAN HAS UNTIL FALL 1964 TO CALL AN ELECTION AT THE TIME MOST

ADVANTAGEOUS TO HIMSELF . MUCH WILL DEPEND ON THE SKILL WITH WHICH

WILSON EXPLOITS TORY WEAKNESSES AND DEMONSTRATES LABOR'S RIGHT TO

GOVERN . THE SON OF AN INDUSTRIAL CHEMIST, JAMES HAROLD WILSON WAS BORN

MARCH 11, 1916, IN THE HEART OF INDUSTRIAL YORKSHIRE, AND SPENT HIS

CHILDHOOD IN A HILLSIDE VILLAGE OVERLOOKING THE FACTORY SMOKE OF THE

COLNE VALLEY . AT THE LOCAL COUNCIL SCHOOL, HE WON THE FIRST OF A

SERIES OF SCHOLARSHIPS THAT EVENTUALLY CARRIED HIM TO OXFORD'S JESUS

COLLEGE, WHERE HE WAS A LEADING MEMBER OF THE DEBATING SOCIETY AND A

CROSS-COUNTRY RUNNER . GRADUATING WITH FIRST CLASS HONORS, WILSON

REMAINED AT OXFORD AS AN ECONOMICS DON UNTIL THE WAR, ENDING UP IN THE

MINISTRY OF FUEL AND POWER . SIR WILLIAM BEVERIDGE EMPLOYED HIM AS A

RESEARCHER FOR HIS FAMED SOCIAL INSURANCE REPORT, AND CALLED WILSON A "

BRILLIANT YOUNG MAN " AND " THE BEST ECONOMIST I'VE EVER HAD . " IN

1945 WILSON STOOD FOR OFFICE FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND, IN THE ELECTION

THAT THREW WINSTON CHURCHILL OUT OF OFFICE, WON A LANCASHIRE SEAT

HANDILY BY 7,022 VOTES . TWO YEARS LATER, WHEN WILSON BECAME PRESIDENT

OF THE BOARD OF TRADE AT 31, HE WAS THE YOUNGEST CABINET MEMBER SINCE

WILLIAM PITT . LITTERED HOUSE . AMONG HIS CONSTITUENTS OR AT HIS

RED-BRICK HOME IN HAMPSTEAD GARDEN SUBURB, WILSON IS AFFABLE, EASYGOING

AND WELL-LIKED . HIS WIFE MARY, THE DAUGHTER OF A BAPTIST MINISTER,

WRITES POETRY AND IS ACTIVE IN HER LOCAL CHURCH ; HIS TWO SONS, ROBIN,

19, AND GILES, 14, LITTER THE HOUSE WITH SPORTS GEAR AND MACKINTOSHES .

BUT IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, THE REACTION TO WILSON IS GENERALLY ONE OF

UNEASY SUSPICION, AND HE IS FREQUENTLY ACCUSED OF BEING " SLIPPERY . "

AS THE ECONOMIST PUT IT LAST WEEK, " ON THE BIG THINGS DEFENSE, THE

AMERICAN ALLIANCE, EAST-WEST, THE NEED TO GIVE LABOR A TWENTIETH

CENTURY LOOK MR . WILSON HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY AMBIGUOUS, INDEED

DELIBERATELY AND CLEVERLY SO . THESE ARE THE REASONS FOR MORE THAN

DOUBT ABOUT HIS LEADERSHIP . " HAVING QUIT THE LABOR CABINET IN 1951,

ALONG WITH FIREBRAND ANEURIN BEVAN, WILSON HAS INHERITED MUCH OF

BEVAN'S LEFTWING SUPPORT . BUT IN THE CABINET HIS MAIN ADMINISTRATIVE

ACHIEVEMENT WAS THE DISMANTLING OF A VAST ARRAY OF CONTROLS ON

BRITAIN'S POSTWAR ECONOMY . HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN MORE PRAGMATIC THAN

DOCTRINAIRE OR OPPORTUNISTIC, HIS ENEMIES SAY . IN A COMMONS SPEECH

LAST WEEK HE DECLARED, " WHAT I AM SAYING MAY OR MAY NOT BE

IDEOLOGICAL, BUT IT WILL GET THE EXPORT ORDERS . " WITH THE LEFT SAFELY

ON HIS SIDE, WILSON IS SHREWD ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT, AS LEADER, HE MUST

NOW CONCILIATE THE PARTY'S CENTER AND RIGHT . WILSON CARRIED ON A MILD

FLIRTATION WITH THE H-BOMB " UNILATERALISTS " WHEN HE CHALLENGED

GAITSKELL FOR PARTY LEADERSHIP IN 1960, AND FOR A TIME PLUMPED FOR

NEUTRALISM INSTEAD OF NATO . LAST WEEK WILSON REASSURED EVERYBODY THAT

THE LABOR PARTY " STANDS FIRMLY BY NATO . " AND HE ADDED, " WE SHOULD

EXPECT TO HAVE A VERY HAPPY RELATIONSHIP " WITH WASHINGTON . IN A

RECENT COMMONS SPEECH HE ARGUED THAT BRITAIN SHOULD AVOID THE NEEDLESS

EXPENSE OF A SEPARATE NUCLEAR DETERRENT, BUT NEVERTHELESS SHOULD HAVE A

VOICE IN DECIDING WHEN THE WEST (I.E., THE U.S.) USES ITS NUCLEAR POWER

: " THERE MUST BE NO ANNIHILATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION ! " WITH

HIS READY TONGUE AND SHARP MIND, HAROLD WILSON WILL PROVE A FORMIDABLE

ADVERSARY FOR PRIME MINISTER HAROLD MACMILLAN (HE WAS SWIFTLY DUBBED "

THE OTHER HAROLD " ) . THERE IS HARDLY AN M.P . WHO HAS A BETTER GRASP

OF PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE OR A BETTER KNACK OF TURNING IT TO HIS

SIDE'S ADVANTAGE . HE HAS ALREADY DRAWN BLOOD WITH HIS SLASHING ATTACKS

ON THE " VAIN NUCLEAR POSTURING " OF THE MACMILLAN GOVERNMENT .

MACMILLAN'S RELATIONS WITH U.S . PRESIDENT JOHN KENNEDY, SAID WILSON,

REMINDED HIM OF A " SEEDY UNCLE " RECEIVING HOMILIES FROM A YOUNG AND

WEALTHY NEPHEW . THOUGH IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO DISCOVER PRECISELY WHERE

HAROLD WILSON STANDS, THERE WAS LITTLE DOUBT LAST WEEK ABOUT WHERE HE

INTENDS TO COME TO REST AT 10 DOWNING STREET .

ITALY OFF & RUNNING FOR ITALY'S 243 ELECTED SENATORS AND 596

DEPUTIES, ALL ROADS LED OUT OF ROME LAST WEEK . GETTING THE JUMP ON THE

PRESIDENTIAL DECREE FORMALLY DISSOLVING PARLIAMENT, THE POLITICIANS

SCURRIED HOME TO START CAMPAIGNING IN THE FIRST GENERAL ELECTION IN

FIVE YEARS . IF THE APRIL 28-29 ELECTION WERE ONLY A PERSONAL

POPULARITY CONTEST, SHORT (5 FT . 1 IN.), MUSTACHIOED PREMIER AMINTORE

FANFANI, 55, MIGHT FIND HIMSELF OUT OF A JOB . FANFANI IS SHREWD, NOT

SIMPATICO ,; BEHIND HIS BACK, CRITICS CALL HIM AND HIS AIDES I

BASSOTTI (THE DACHSHUNDS) . MORE THAN FANFANI'S LOOKS AND COLD

POLITICAL STYLE ARE AGAINST HIM . A 6 PER CENT JUMP IN LIVING COSTS

LAST YEAR TOUCHED OFF A PROLONGED WAVE OF STRIKES BY INDUSTRIAL AND

WHITECOLLAR WORKERS ; FORTNIGHT AGO, 5,000,000 WORKERS QUIT THEIR JOBS

IN A ONE-DAY GENERAL WALKOUT . FANFANI'S YEAR-OLD PARTNERSHIP WITH

PIETRO NENNI'S LEFT-WING SOCIALISTS, THE APERTURA A SINISTRA (OPENING

TO THE LEFT), HAS SHARPLY DIVIDED THE PREMIER'S OWN CHRISTIAN

DEMOCRATIC PARTY ; THE COALITION'S MAJOR LEGISLATIVE ACCOMPLISHMENT

THE NEEDLESS AND EXPENSIVE NATIONALIZATION OF THE ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY,

WHICH WAS NENNI'S PRICE FOR COLLABORATION HAS TURNED MANY BUSINESSMEN

AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT . STILL, FANFANI FIGURES TO STAY ON TOP . OF THE

SIX NATIONS IN THE COMMON MARKET, ITALY'S ESTIMATED 6 PER CENT GROWTH

RATE THIS YEAR IS THE HIGHEST ; AT ABOUT 1,000,000, UNEMPLOYMENT IS

HALF THE 1956 LEVEL . MANY ITALIANS FEAR THAT FLIRTATION WITH THAT OLD

STALIN PRIZEWINNER PIETRO NENNI WILL EVENTUALLY LEAD ITALY DOWN THE

PATH TO NEUTRALISM . BUT SO FAR, NENNI HAS PULLED TO THE RIGHT IN

INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, AWAY FROM HIS LONGTIME COMMUNIST ALLIES . HE HAS

EVEN HALFHEARTEDLY ENDORSED A NATO NUCLEAR FORCE . NENNI WAS PROBABLY

SAVED A LITTLE SOCIALISTIC EMBARRASSMENT WHEN THE U.S . RECENTLY AGREED

TO PULL ITS JUPITER MISSILES OUT OF ITALY .

SOARED FROM COMPLETE OBSCURITY TO A SPOT IN WALTER ULBRICHT'S CABINET .

FIRST GAINING PROMINENCE WITH HIS LECTURES ON ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AT EAST

BERLIN'S HUMBOLDT UNIVERSITY, BARTSCH WAS GIVEN A JOB CONTROLLING

PERHAPS HE DID NOT TELL HIS COLLEAGUES OF SOME OF HIS EARLIER

ACHIEVEMENTS : A PLACE IN THE HITLERJUGEND AT NINE, HITLER'S CROSS OF

DANZIG AT 16 (PRESUMABLY FOR DEEDS IN POLAND), A WAR CAREER IN THE

NOTORIOUS SS . WESTERN INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES KNEW ALL ABOUT BARTSCH,

HOWEVER . HIS NAME HAD TURNED UP IN THE BERLIN DOCUMENTS CENTER, AN

ARCHIVE OF OLD NAZI MEMBERSHIP FILES RESCUED FROM THE STORAGE HEAP OF A

WEST GERMAN PAPERMILL AFTER THE WAR . RESISTING THE TEMPTATION TO SPILL

HEADLINES . THEN ULBRICHT'S PARTY CONTROL COMMITTEE MET AND DECIDED

GRANDIOSE SCHEME TO TRANSPLANT MOST OF SOUTH AFRICA'S 11 MILLION

NATIVES INTO NINE BACK-COUNTRY, ALL-BLACK BANTUSTANS WAS SUPPOSED TO

PUT AN END TO THE COUNTRY'S RACIAL UNREST . INSTEAD, IT HAS ONLY

INCREASED THE DANGEROUS TENSION BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE . THE FIRST

BANTUSTAN ON VERWOERD'S LIST WAS THE TRANSKEI, A DENMARK-SIZE (16,500

SQ . MI.) AREA OF ERODED FARM LAND ON THE INDIAN OCEAN . NOBODY KNOWS

THE TROUBLES IT HAS SEEN . EVER SINCE AFRICANS WENT ON A RAMPAGE THERE

MORE THAN TWO YEARS AGO, MURDERING THE GOVERNMENT'S HANDPICKED TRIBAL

CHIEFS AND SETTING FIRE TO ENTIRE VILLAGES, MOBILE POLICE PATROLS ARMED

WITH STEN GUNS, ARMORED CARS, AND HELICOPTER SPOTTER PLANES HAVE HAD TO

STAY ON DUTY IN PARTS OF THE TRANSKEI . FORTNIGHT AGO, A WHITE FAMILY

OF FOUR WERE CAPRICIOUSLY HACKED TO DEATH WITH PANGAS AS THEY STUMBLED

DOWN THE STEPS OF THEIR BURNING TRAILER, SET AFIRE WHILE PARKED ON A

ROAD ONLY 30 MILES FROM THE TRANSKEI'S CAPITAL OF UMTATA . LAST WEEK,

PARTY-CONTROLLED LEGISLATURE, PROBABLY BY JUNE THERE WAS MORE TROUBLE .

CHIEF, THE CHIEF MINISTER OF THE NEW TRANSKEI GOVERNMENT . THE

BODYGUARD OF A HEADMAN SERVING MATANZIMA GOT INTO A TRIBAL FIGHT WITH

40 WARRIORS ARMED WITH SPEARS AND AXES . MATANZIMA QUICKLY MUSTERED 500

MEN TO CRUSH THE REVOLT, AND SOUTH AFRICAN POLICE STOOD BY WITH A

TRUCKLOAD OF MEN AND A HELICOPTER . THE REBELS FLED INTO THE HILLS .

POLICE BLAMED THE TRAILER MURDERS AND THE TRIBAL OUTBREAK ON THE

INCREASING INFLUENCE OF POQO (PRONOUNCED PAW-KAW), AN AFRICAN TERRORIST

20,000 WHITES, AND 14,000 COLOREDS WILL BE STRICTLY LIMITED . ALL

MEASURES PASSED BY THE LOCAL LEGISLATURE OF TRIBAL CHIEFS AND ELECTED

REPRESENTATIVES ARE SUBJECT TO VETO BY THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ; CAPE

TOWN STILL WILL CONTROL JUSTICE AND INTERNAL SECURITY . MONEY TO

IMPROVE THE BARREN REGION WILL BE LACKING . VERWOERD HAS PROMISED AN

ANNUAL BUDGET SUBSIDY OF $30 MILLION, BUT THIS FALLS FAR SHORT OF

NEW INDUSTRY . IN ADDITION, MATANZIMA FACES POWERFUL POLITICAL

OPPOSITION FROM ANOTHER TEMBU CHIEF, SABATA DALINDYEBO, WHO DOES NOT

200 AFRICAN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS ON COMMUNIST SCHOLARSHIPS MARCHED DOWN

SOFIA'S LENIN BOULEVARD TOWARD THE OFFICE OF PREMIER TODOR ZHIVKOV TO

PROTEST GOVERNMENT RESTRICTIONS . INSTEAD OF SYMPATHY, THEY WERE MET BY

600 BULGARIAN MILITIAMEN, WHO FLAILED THE AFRICANS WITH CLUBS AND

HAULED THEM OFF TO JAIL . ALL THE STUDENTS HAD ASKED FOR WAS PERMISSION

TO MAINTAIN AN ALL-AFRICA STUDENT UNION . LIKE OTHER AFRICANS IN

EASTERN EUROPE, THE 350 AFRICAN STUDENTS IN BULGARIA FOUND MORE

SEGREGATION THAN BROTHERHOOD, MORE INDOCTRINATION THAN EDUCATION .

ROUND OF THE NUCLEAR TEST BAN NEGOTIATIONS, THE WEST REFUSED TO SCALE

RUSSIANS, WHO ORIGINALLY REFUSED TO PERMIT ANY INSPECTIONS, THREE YEARS

AGREED TO " TWO OR THREE, " AND LAST WEEK WOULD NOT GO HIGHER . A

AT EAST-WEST CONFERENCES RESULTS IN A TENDENCY TO ACCEPT THE ARGUMENTS

OF BOTH SIDES : " YOU COME TO THINK THAT THE RUSSIANS OBJECT TO

CONTROLS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO CHEAT, AND THE WEST INSISTS ON CONTROLS

BECAUSE THEY WANT TO SPY IN RUSSIA . YOU REACH THE CONCLUSION THAT

EVERYBODY IS EQUALLY WRONG . " IMPOSED DEADLINE . A CITY OF 182,000 AND

THE BIRTHPLACE OF JEAN JACQUES ROUSSEAU, AS WELL AS OF THE RED CROSS,

GENEVA GOT INTO THE CONFERENCE BUSINESS EARLY . DURING THE 16TH

CENTURY, UNDER REFORMER JOHN CALVIN, GENEVA WAS THE PROTESTANT ROME .

IN 1872 GENEVA'S CITY HALL WAS THE HEADQUARTERS OF A FIVE-MAN

COMMISSION THAT ARBITRATED A DISPUTE BETWEEN BRITAIN AND THE U.S . OVER

THE DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE BRITISH-BUILT CONFEDERATE RAIDER ALABAMA .

THE LUCKLESS LEAGUE OF NATIONS WAS ESTABLISHED IN GENEVA IN 1920 .

AFTER THE LEAGUE WAS ERASED BY WORLD WAR II, THE UNITED NATIONS TOOK

OVER THE VAST PALAIS DES NATIONS AS ITS EUROPEAN BASE . GENEVA IS TO

DIPLOMATS WHAT NIAGARA FALLS IS TO HONEYMOONERS . EVERY MEETING OF

EVERY CONFERENCE IS FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH ENDLESS, MULTILINGUAL TALK

. ONLY RARELY DOES THE PALAIS, ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST OFFICE

BUILDINGS, COME TO LIFE WITH SUCH DRAMATIC MOMENTS AS EMPEROR HAILE

SELASSIE'S MOVING SPEECH AGAINST MUSSOLINI'S INVASION OF ETHIOPIA, OR

OF THE LESS DEVELOPED AREAS, A GROUP KNOWN AS UNCSCAT FOR SHORT .

MEETINGS MOST OFTEN OCCUR DURING

THE GOOD WEATHER MONTHS, AND USUALLY AFFORD SUFFICIENT TIME OFF FOR

DELEGATES TO ENJOY THE DELIGHTS OF MOUNTAIN AND BEACH . THE PERMANENT

U.N . EMPLOYEES IN GENEVA LEAD A QUIET, INCESTUOUS LIFE MADE UP OF

INTIMATE COCKTAIL PARTIES, SMALL DINNERS AND CASUAL MEETINGS IN THE

PALAIS BAR, WHICH SERVES SANDWICHES SO DISMAL THAT THEY ARE ALLEGED TO

BE REJECTS FROM COMMERCIAL AIRLINES . THE CITIZENS OF GENEVA, WHO ARE

MOSTLY FRENCH-SPEAKING SWISS, IGNORE THE PERMANENT U.N . STAFF, THE

DELEGATES AND THE TOURISTS, AND DEVOTE THEMSELVES TO MAKING WATCHES,

PRECISION TOOLS AND, ESPECIALLY, MONEY . AN 18TH-CENTURY FRENCH FOREIGN

MINISTER ONCE ADVISED A FRIEND, " IF YOU SEE A GENEVESE JUMP OUT OF A

WINDOW, JUMP RIGHT AFTER HIM . THERE'S 15 PER CENT TO BE GAINED . " BUT

WILDNESS . IN BERN AND ZURICH THE SIDEWALKS ARE ROLLED UP AT MIDNIGHT,

BUT GENEVA'S NIGHT SPOTS CAN STAY OPEN UNTIL 4 A.M . POLICE CANNOT

BREAK INTO GENEVA HOTEL ROOMS AND ASK TO SEE MARRIAGE LICENSES AS THEY

CAN IN MOST GERMAN SWISS CITIES . GENEVA HAS ONLY A FEW LICENSED

PROSTITUTES BUT NO SUSCEPTIBLE VISITOR HAS EVER BEEN KNOWN TO COMPLAIN

OF A LACK OF COMPLAISANT WOMEN . OCCASIONALLY, THERE ARE CRIMINAL

ACTIVITIES . DURING THE 1960 DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE, SIR MICHAEL

NIGHT OF THE MURDER SHELTERED FROM THE BLITZ IN LONDON'S WARREN STREET

SUBWAY STATION AND PRODUCED FIVE INDEPENDENT WITNESSES TO PROVE IT . "

THIS IS THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY CASE I'VE EVER KNOWN, " SAID THE JUDGE .

/ ON THE ONE HAND A FULL CONFESSION, AND ON THE OTHER AN UNSHAKABLE

ALIBI . " THE JURY, EQUALLY PUZZLED, COULD NOT REACH A VERDICT . IN A

RETRIAL, LOUGHAN WAS ACQUITTED . HE WAS STILL GLOATING WHEN ARRESTED ON

THE STEPS OF OLD BAILEY FOR ANOTHER ROBBERY AND, AFTER HIS 24TH

CONVICTION, SENT TO PRISON FOR SEVEN YEARS . THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE

LAST ANYBODY HEARD OF LITTLE HAROLD LOUGHAN IF THE PEOPLE, A

SENSATIONAL LONDON SUNDAY NEWSPAPER, HAD NOT PRINTED THE MEMOIRS OF

PROSECUTOR CASSWELL . IN ONE INSTALLMENT, CASSWELL CLAIMED THAT HAROLD

LOUGHAN WOULD HAVE BEEN CONVICTED IF ALL THE EVIDENCE HAD BEEN HEARD .

LOUGHAN, NOW 66 AND IN JAIL AS USUAL, SUED FOR LIBEL, CLAIMING HE HAD

BEEN CALLED A MURDERER DESPITE HIS OFFICIAL INNOCENCE . MURDER OR LIBEL

. THE NEWSPAPER'S LAWYER ARGUED THAT EVEN IF THE ARTICLES DID AMOUNT TO

CALLING LOUGHAN A MURDERER, TRUTH IS A DEFENSE AGAINST LIBEL, AND

CASSWELL HAD FINALLY SHOWN THAT LOUGHAN HAD INDEED MURDERED ROSE

ROBINSON 19 YEARS AGO . FOR ELEVEN DAYS THE JURY HEARD EVIDENCE OF THE

OLD MURDER WITH LOUGHAN STILL PROTESTING HIS INNOCENCE . " YOU ARE

ASKED TO TRY AGAIN A MURDER IN THE GUISE OF A LIBEL ACTION, " HIS

LAWYER COMPLAINED TO THE JURY . LAST WEEK THE JURY RETURNED ITS VERDICT

: THE PEOPLE WAS NOT GUILTY OF LIBEL BECAUSE LOUGHAN WAS GUILTY OF THE

MURDER . LOUGHAN, OF COURSE, CANNOT BE TRIED AGAIN FOR THE SAME CRIME .

IF THE JURY WAS CORRECT, HE HAD CHEATED THE GALLOWS . BUT THAT WAS

LITTLE COMFORT TO HAROLD LOUGHAN . AFTER THE TRIAL HE WAS RETURNED TO

THE PRISON HOSPITAL WHERE, AFTER SPENDING 23 OF HIS 66 YEARS BEHIND

BARS, HE AWAITS DEATH FROM INOPERABLE CANCER .

MIDDLE EAST WHO'S

WOOING WHO ? IN CAIRO, PRESIDENT GAMAL ABDEL NASSER ACTED LIKE AN

EX-CHAMPION SEEKING A SUCCESSFUL COMEBACK . HE LOST MUCH OF HIS CLAIM

FOR THE TITLE OF ARAB LEADERSHIP IN 1961, WHEN AN ARMY COUP WRENCHED

SYRIA FROM ITS SHORT-LIVED MERGER WITH EGYPT IN THE UNITED ARAB

REPUBLIC . THAT LEFT NASSER WITHOUT A SINGLE ARAB ALLY, AND SURROUNDED

BY SUCH VIRULENT ENEMIES AS IRAQ'S DICTATOR KASSEM AND THE KINGS OF

JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA . THEN CAME LAST MONTH'S IRAQI REVOLUTION AND

THE OVERTHROW OF KASSEM . NO ONE COULD BLAME EGYPT'S LEADER FOR HARKING

BACK TO OLD DREAMS OF ARAB GRANDEUR, FOR THIS NEW MAN IN BAGHDAD

PRESIDENT ABDUL SALAM AREF WAS A FORMER NASSER PROTEGE DEDICATED TO

PANARAB UNITY . TRIBUTE TO MOTHER . WITH THIS IN MIND, NASSER MOUNTED A

PLATFORM IN CAIRO'S VAST REPUBLIC SQUARE LAST WEEK TO CELEBRATE THE

FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEFUNCT UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC . STRINGS OF

RAMADAN LIGHTS OUTLINED THE MOSQUES AND MINARETS, AND A CROWD OF 20,000

JAMMED THE SQUARE PROTECTED FROM THE COLD NIGHT AIR BY A SIWAN, A "

HALL " ROOFED AND WALLED BY BRIGHTLY COLORED CANVAS . " UNION ! UNION

! UNION ! NASSER ! NASSER ! NASSER ! " ROARED THE MOB . WHAT

IT GOT WAS A LITTLE LESS THAN NASSER HAD HOPED FOR . THE LEADERS OF THE

IRAQI DELEGATION TO THE CELEBRATION, DEPUTY PREMIER ALI SALEH SAADI AND

FOREIGN MINISTER TALIB HUSSEIN SHABIB, WERE CORDIAL ENOUGH, BUT THEY

WERE FAR FROM SPECIFIC . SAADI DUTIFULLY PAID TRIBUTE TO EGYPT AS THE "

MOTHER REPUBLIC " OF THE ARAB WORLD, BUT INSTEAD OF CALLING FOR UNION,

HE URGED ONLY A /FRANK RAPPROCHEMENT " BETWEEN CAIRO AND BAGHDAD . WAS

THIS ENOUGH SURE, CRIED NASSER IN HIS OWN SPEECH . TODAY, HE DECLARED

/ THERE IS A UNITY OF OBJECTIVES BETWEEN THE REVOLUTION IN BAGHDAD AND

THE REVOLUTION IN CAIRO, " AND " WE DO NOT NEED TREATIES OR

CONSTITUTIONAL FORMS TO PROVE THIS UNITY . " JAIL FOR THE DOG . IN

BAGHDAD, NEW PRESIDENT AREF AND HIS COLLEAGUES WERE TOO BUSY LEARNING

HOW TO RUN A COUNTRY TO PAY MUCH ATTENTION . THE SLAIN KASSEM, NOW

DUBBED " THE MAD TYRANT, " HAD QUARRELED WITH ALL HIS NEIGHBORS . AREF

WAS RESTORING TRADE RELATIONS WITH EGYPT, IMPORTS FROM LEBANON AND

EXPORTS TO LITTLE KUWAIT, THE OIL-RICH PRINCIPALITY KASSEM ONCE TRIED

TO TAKE OVER . TIDYING UP ANOTHER NATIONAL PROBLEM, AREF SENT A

HELICOPTER NORTH TO PICK UP TWO DELEGATES OF THE KURDISH REBELS IN THE

HOPE THAT HE MIGHT NEGOTIATE AN END TO THE BLOODY CIVIL WAR THAT HAS

TIED UP HALF THE 75,000-MAN IRAQI ARMY ; HE EVEN MADE FRIENDLY

OVERTURES TO THE U.S.-BRITISH CONTROLLED IRAQ PETROLEUM CO., WHICH

KASSEM HAD ALIENATED . AS FOR THE COMMUNISTS OF BAGHDAD, THEY WERE

STILL GOING INTO JAILS . THE RESULT WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST SINGLE RED

PROPAGANDA BARRAGES SINCE THE REDS CHARGED THE U.S . WITH USING GERM

WARFARE IN KOREA . PRAVDA'S CORRESPONDENT CLAIMED, " I SAW TANKS CRUSH

WOMEN AND CHILDREN, " AND REPORTED THE " PHYSICAL ANNIHILATION OF

HUNDREDS, PERHAPS THOUSANDS, OF IRAQI DEMOCRATS AND PATRIOTS . " THE

PRAVDA MAN WENT LOOKING FOR AZIZ SHARIF, A 1962 LENIN PEACE PRIZEWINNER

AT THE OFFICE OF THE PEACE PARTISANS LEAGUE (A EUPHEMISM FOR RED

MILITIA) . A SOLDIER ON GUARD AT THE OFFICE TOLD HIM, " THAT DOG HAS

LONG SINCE BEEN JAILED . " THE SOVIET RED CROSS EVEN APPEALED TO THE

INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS TO HELP PROTECT COMMUNISTS, WHOM IT PREFERRED

TO CALL " THE DEMOCRATIC PATRIOTS VICTIMIZED BY BLOODY PERSECUTION IN

IRAQ . " WHEN THE FIRST HECTIC DAYS WERE OVER, THE NOVICES WOULD GET

AROUND TO ANSWERING GAMAL ABDEL NASSER'S CRY FOR UNION . AT WEEK'S END

IRAQ'S THINKING WAS SUMMED UP BY FOREIGN MINISTER SHAHIB, WHO PROPOSED

A JOINT MEETING OF THE FOUR " LIBERATED " ARAB STATES (IRAQ, EGYPT,

YEMEN, ALGERIA) TO " COORDINATE WORK AMONG THEM IN VARIOUS FIELDS WITH

BY INTERNAL DISSENSION, THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN UNABLE TO MAINTAIN A

CEASE-FIRE, EVICT ALL FOREIGN MILITARY PERSONNEL FROM LAOS, INTEGRATE

THE THREE MILITARY AND POLITICAL FACTIONS, OR HOLD FREE ELECTIONS . BUT

THE SUPPOSEDLY " NEUTRALIST " GOVERNMENT HAS RECOGNIZED EVERY COUNTRY

IN THE COMMUNIST BLOC, AND HAS DONE SO LITTLE TO HALT THE RAMPANT

INFLATION THAT THE PRICE OF THE KIP HAS RISEN FROM 80 TO 180 PER DOLLAR

. ON THE PLAINE DES JARRES, HEADQUARTERS OF BOTH THE NEUTRALIST AND

COMMUNIST PATHET LAO ARMIES, THE REDS HAVE BEGUN A CAMPAIGN TO

INFILTRATE AND SUBVERT THE FORCES OF THEIR ONETIME NEUTRALIST ALLIES .

FARTHER NORTH, THOUSANDS OF RED CHINESE WORKERS HAVE CROSSED INTO LAOS

TO BUILD ROADS LINKING CHINA'S YUNNAN PROVINCE WITH COMMUNIST-HELD

NIGERIA NATION ON TRIAL IN 1960, WHEN NIGERIA WON ITS

INDEPENDENCE, IT BECAME AT BIRTH THE WORLD'S MOST POPULOUS BLACK STATE

AND AFRICA'S BIGGEST QUESTION MARK . HELD TOGETHER IN UNEASY

FEDERATION, THE COUNTRY NUMBERED SOME 250 TRIBES AND LANGUAGES, THREE

PRINCIPAL RELIGIONS (MOSLEM, CHRISTIAN, ANIMIST), AND THREE BIG,

TRADITIONALLY HOSTILE REGIONS : THE FEUDAL, MOSLEM NORTH, WHICH CLAIMS

HALF THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF NIGERIA ; THE EAST, DOMINATED BY THE

ASTUTE, INDUSTRIOUS IBO TRIBES ; AND THE WEST, RICHEST AND MOST

ADVANCED OF ALL THREE, WHOSE YORUBA TRIBESMEN ARE NIGERIA'S MOST

SOPHISTICATED CITIZENS . AS BIG AS TEXAS AND OKLAHOMA COMBINED, WITH

SOME 45 MILLION INHABITANTS GIVE OR TAKE 10 MILLION NIGERIA SEEMED LESS

A NATION THAN A CONCATENATION, A HAPHAZARD CREATION OF BRITISH

COLONISTS WHO RULED IT FOR 60 YEARS AND DUBBED IT THE " WHITE MAN'S

GRAVE . " NIGERIA HAS SURVIVED TO BECOME AFRICA'S MOST CONSPICUOUSLY

SUCCESSFUL DEMOCRACY . ITS BIRTH PANGS WERE EASED BY A LONG TRADITION

OF TRIBAL GOVERNMENT, AND BY THE SOLID GOOD SENSE OF MANY AFRICAN

LEADERS WHOM THE BRITISH GROOMED FOR SELF-RULE NOTABLY ITS FEDERAL

PRIME MINISTER, SIR ABUBAKAR TAFAWA BALEWA (TIME COVER, DEC . 5, 1960)

. THE GREATEST SINGLE ASSURANCE OF STABILITY HAS BEEN NIGERIA'S TRIPOD

FORM OF GOVERNMENT, DESIGNED TO PREVENT ANY ONE REGION FROM DOMINATING

THE OTHER TWO . THAT SYSTEM IS NOW IN JEOPARDY, AND WITH IT THE VERY

FUTURE OF NIGERIA AS A DEMOCRACY AND AS A NATION . POLITICAL PLAY ?

NIGERIA'S COMPLEX CRISIS IS BEING PLAYED OUT IN THE SCRUPULOUSLY

DECOROUS HIGH COURT IN THE FEDERAL CAPITAL OF LAGOS . THERE, IN THE

COURSE OF A TRIAL THAT HAS DRAGGED ON FOR FOUR MONTHS, THE LEADER OF

THE OPPOSITION, OBAFEMI AWOLOWO, LAST WEEK OPENED HIS OWN DEFENSE

AGAINST A GOVERNMENT INDICTMENT CHARGING HIM AND 24 OTHER LEADING

POLITICIANS WITH CONSPIRACY TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT . NEARLY ALL

THE DEFENDANTS ARE MEMBERS OF AWOLOWO'S ACTION GROUP, THE PARTY THAT

RULES WESTERN NIGERIA AND REPRESENTS IT IN THE FEDERAL PARLIAMENT .

CHIEF AWOLOWO IS NOT ALONE IN BRANDING THE TRIAL A POLITICAL PLAY TO

WRECK HIS PARTY AND ELIMINATE THE OPPOSITION . THE CRISIS WAS ACTUALLY

PRECIPITATED BY AWOLOWO, 54, A MERCURIAL, LONDON-TRAINED BARRISTER WHO

BECAME OPPOSITION LEADER IN LAGOS WHEN HIS PARTY LOST THE 1959 FEDERAL

ELECTIONS . AWOLOWO THEN RANGED HIS PEOPLE FIRMLY AGAINST THE

MIDDLE-ROAD COALITION GOVERNMENT, COMPOSED OF THE CONSERVATIVE NORTHERN

PEOPLE'S CONGRESS (NPC), SUPPORTED BY THE PROUD, PRIMITIVE FULANI AND

HAUSA TRIBES OF THE NORTH, AND THE PROGRESSIVE NATIONAL CONVENTION OF

NIGERIAN CITIZENS (NCNC), WHICH IS BASED IN THE EAST . SMASHED MACE .

CHIEF SAMUEL L . AKINTOLA, WHO BECAME DEPUTY LEADER OF THE ACTION GROUP

AND WESTERN REGION PREMIER, LAST MAY REBELLED AGAINST AWOLOWO'S

POLICIES, WAS SACKED AS DEPUTY LEADER AND DISMISSED AS THE WEST'S

PREMIER (HE WAS LATER REINSTATED BY COURT ORDER) . AWOLOWO'S

HIGH-HANDED REPRISALS LED TO A CHAIRTHROWING MELEE IN THE WESTERN

REGION ASSEMBLY AT IBADAN IN WHICH THE CEREMONIAL MACE WAS SHATTERED

AND THE POLITICIANS SUBDUED WITH TEAR GAS . SEIZING THEIR CHANCE TO

QUASH THE OPPOSITION, RIVAL PARTY BOSSES IN LAGOS PERSUADED THE

RELUCTANT SIR ABUBAKAR TO DISPATCH FEDERAL FORCES TO THE WEST AND

DECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY THAT WAS LIFTED ONLY AT YEAR'S END . THE

GOVERNMENT ALSO INITIATED AN EXHAUSTIVE INVESTIGATION OF REGIONAL AND

PARTY FINANCES, CHARGED AWOLOWO AND OTHER PARTY CHIEFTAINS WITH

DIVERTING $18 MILLION IN PUBLIC FUNDS . ON TOP OF THE CORRUPTION

SCANDALS, THE GOVERNMENT LAST NOVEMBER FILED ITS SENSATIONAL INDICTMENT

ACCUSING AWOLOWO OF SENDING AGENTS TO GHANA FOR PARA-MILITARY TRAINING

AS TERRORISTS IN A PLOT TO SEIZE POWER IN LAGOS . UNIVERSAL DASH .

CHIEF AWOLOWO LAST WEEK SCORNFULLY TERMED " ABSOLUTELY UNRELIABLE AND

INCREDIBLE " THE PROSECUTION'S CHARGES THAT HE HAD CONSPIRED TO " LEVY

WAR " AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT . " TODAY, " HE SAID DEFIANTLY, " I MAY BE

LANGUISHING IN PRISON . I AM NOT GOING TO DIE THERE . I STILL BELIEVE I

WILL BE PRIME MINISTER SOME DAY . /

AS FOR THE CORRUPTION CHARGES, AWOLOWO'S

SUPPORTERS ARGUE THAT MALFEASANCE IS NO LESS RIFE IN THE OTHER REGIONS

. THEY ARE PROBABLY QUITE RIGHT . " DASH, " AS NIGERIANS CHEERFULLY

CALL THEIR RITUALISTIC SYSTEM OF PAYOFFS, IS SO UNIVERSAL THAT MANY

TRAFFIC COPS HAVE A FIXED BRIBE FOR EVERY VIOLATION (RUNNING A RED

LIGHT COSTS 28 #$ ), AND HOSPITAL NURSES SOMETIMES DEMAND A PENNY FOR

BRINGING A PATIENT A BEDPAN . MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT, WHOSE CADILLACS

AND MERCEDESES HELP MAKE LAGOS TRAFFIC JAMS AMONG THE WORST IN AFRICA,

EARN MORE ($17,000 INCLUDING EXPENSES) THAN BRITISH M.P.S, BUT MANY

MANAGE TO EKE OUT THE COST OF LIVING ON IKOYI ISLAND WITH A LITTLE HELP

FROM FOREIGN INDUSTRIALISTS AND LOCAL ENTREPRENEURS . " NIGERIAN

BUSINESSMEN, " SAYS A EUROPEAN BANKER IN LAGOS, " ARE THE BIGGEST BUNCH

OF CON MEN I'VE EVER SEEN . " FOR ALL THEIR SURFACE CYNICISM, NIGERIANS

BY CONTRAST WITH MOST THIN-SKINNED CITIZENS OF AFRICA'S NEW NATIONS ARE

SEARCHINGLY SELF-CRITICAL AND TAKE FIERCE PRIDE IN THEIR EXUBERANTLY

UNINHIBITED PRESS . YOUNGER POLITICIANS IN ALL THE PARTIES ARE

INCREASINGLY DISILLUSIONED BY THE FLAGRANT VENALITY OF THEIR ELDERS AND

THE CHASM THAT DIVIDES LAGOS' DOYENS OF DASH FROM THE JOBLESS HORDES

WHO HAVE SWARMED INTO ITS FESTERING SLUMS AND ALMOST TREBLED THE CITY'S

POPULATION (TO 750,000) IN THREE DECADES . THE BEST GUARANTEE . MANY

YOUNG NIGERIANS DERIDE THE GOVERNMENT'S FAITH IN PRIVATE ENTERPRISE,

AND IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS THEY ARE OPENLY IMPATIENT WITH THE

INCORRUPTIBLE SIR ABUBAKAR'S PRAGMATIC, UNPRETENTIOUS AND RATHER

OLD-FASHIONED STYLE . AS AFRICA'S MOST POPULOUS NATION, THEY ARGUE,

NIGERIA IS THE CONTINENT'S LOGICAL LEADER . " WHEN YOU'RE IN ACCRA, "

COMPLAINS A LAGOS NEWSMAN, " YOU CANNOT HELP FEELING THAT YOU'RE AT THE

CENTER OF PAN-AFRICAN ACTIVITY . WHY DON'T WE GET REFUGEES FROM OTHER

PARTS OF AFRICA ? " IF THE ACTION GROUP IS DESTROYED BY THE TREASON

TRIAL, MANY NIGERIANS BELIEVE, A NEW, RADICAL PARTY WILL HAVE TO TAKE

ITS PLACE OR ELSE THE NATION'S RESTIVE LEFTWINGERS MAY WELL RESORT TO

REAL VIOLENCE . MEANWHILE, THOUGH PREMIER AKINTOLA HAS ALREADY FORMED A

NEW,MODERATE MOVEMENT IN THE WEST CALLED THE UNITED PEOPLE'S PARTY, THE

VACUUM LEFT BY THE ACTION GROUP MAY BE FILLED BY THE NCNC, WHOSE

LONGTIME BOSS, DR . NNAMDI ( " ZIK " ) AZIKIWE, IS MORE OR LESS REMOVED

FROM ACTIVE POLITICS IN HIS POST AS NIGERIA'S GOVERNOR-GENERAL . BUT

AMBITIOUS, FLAMBOYANT ZIK MAKES NO SECRET OF HIS AIM TO MAKE NIGERIA A

REPUBLIC, IN WHICH NCNC COULD EMERGE AS THE DOMINANT NATIONAL PARTY AND

ZIK HIMSELF MIGHT WELL BE A STRONG PRESIDENT.MANY NIGERIANS, SHOCKED BY

THE GOVERNMENT'S SEVEN-MONTH SUSPENSION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, NOW FEAR THAT

A SINGLE, POWERFUL PARTY MAY BE TEMPTED TO IMPOSE THE KIND OF

AUTHORITARIAN RULE THAT HAS BEEN RIVETED ON GHANA AND GUINEA . THE

GOVERNMENT'S MOST IMMEDIATE CONCERN IS THAT THE COUNTRY'S CURRENT

SCANDALS WILL MAR ITS REPUTATION FOR STABILITY AND SCARE AWAY THE

FOREIGN INVESTORS ON WHOM IT IS COUNTING FOR AT LEAST 50 PER CENT OF

THE FINANCING FOR THE $1.9 BILLION, SIX-YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN IT

LAUNCHED LAST YEAR . TO SIR ABUBAKAR, THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PROGRESS

THIS WILL ENSURE IS THE BEST GUARANTEE OF MEANINGFUL NATIONHOOD FOR

NIGERIA .

CREATION OF A MULTINATIONAL NUCLEAR DETERRENT CONSISTING OF A FLEET OF

SURFACE SHIPS EQUIPPED WITH THE U.S . POLARIS MISSILE . KEY PROVISION

OF THE PLAN IS THAT THE SHIPS WOULD BE " MULTIMANNED, " I.E., THEIR

CREWS WOULD BE DRAWN FROM EVERY NATO NATION THAT WOULD BE WILLING TO

HELP FOOT THE BILL . COST OF THE INTERNATIONAL TASK FORCE WOULD BE

ABOUT $2 BILLION FOR 200 MISSILES AND THEIR FLOATING LAUNCH PADS ; IT

WOULD TAKE AT LEAST THREE YEARS TO BUILD, ABOUT HALF AS MUCH IN TIME

AND MONEY AS IT WOULD TAKE TO CREATE A MULTINATIONAL NUCLEAR POLARIS

SUBMARINE FLEET . ORIGINALLY, IN FACT, THE U.S . HAD HASTILY SUGGESTED

THAT MULTI-MANNED, MULTINATIONAL POLARIS SUBMARINES MIGHT BE A LOGICAL

PROGRESSION FROM THE INDEPENDENT POLARIS SUBS THAT BRITAIN HAS AGREED

TO BUILD (BUT HAS COMMITTED TO NATO) . APART FROM THE COST, HOWEVER,

CONGRESS HAS ALREADY INDICATED THAT IT IS DEAD SET AGAINST GIVING U.S .

ALLIES THE COMPONENTS OR KNOW-HOW TO BUILD THE SUBMARINES . MOREOVER,

OLD NAVAL HANDS ARE AGHAST AT THE PROSPECT OF MANNING SUBMARINES WITH

CREWS OF MIXED NATIONALITIES . WARNED A WEST GERMAN NAVAL EXPERT LAST

PROVOKES, HOWEVER, THE QUESTION OF CONTROL IS LARGELY ACADEMIC ; THE

FINGERS WOULD BE UNANIMOUS . " DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT EUROPE WILL

WANT TO SHOOT THIS THING OFF WITHOUT BEING SURE THAT THE MAJOR U.S .

FORCE WOULD BE USED ? " ASKED A U.S . STRATEGIST . " CONSIDERING IT

AS A SECOND STRIKE FORCE, THE SEMANTICS OF VOTING BECOMES IRRELEVANT .

FRANCE THE PERSONAL TOUCH AS OTHER EUROPEANS RAILED AGAINST

CHARLES DE GAULLE'S VISION OF A FRENCH-LED EUROPE, MANY FRENCHMEN LAST

WEEK WERE UNEASILY CONTEMPLATING DE GAULLE'S INFLUENCE ON THEIR OWN

SOCIETY . SINCE THE NOVEMBER ELECTION TURNED THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY INTO

A VIRTUAL ANNEXE OF THE ELYSEE PALACE, DE GAULLE HAS RULED WITH LITTLE

PARLIAMENTARY CRITICISM AND WITH ONLY MUTED RUMBLINGS FROM FRANCE'S

ONCE RAMBUNCTIOUS PRESS . IT HAS BECOME CLEAR THAT LE GRAND CHARLES HAS

ESTABLISHED A PERSONAL REGIME IN WHICH, THOUGH IT IS NOT REMOTELY SO

AUTOCRATIC A GOVERNMENT AS THAT OF FRANCISCO FRANCO, ALMOST ANY

POTENTIAL CONTROVERSY IS SIMILARLY QUELLED BY THE GOVERNMENT LEST IT BE

INTERPRETED ABROAD AS A DIRECT EXPRESSION OF NATIONAL POLICIES . WITH

VIRTUALLY UNLIMITED POWERS UNDER FRANCE'S EMERGENCY LAWS, DE GAULLE'S

GOVERNMENT IN RECENT MONTHS HAS : CANCELED THE SHOWING OF A TV

DOCUMENTARY TO MARK THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BATTLE OF STALINGRAD .

PREPARED BY THE STATE-OWNED TV NETWORK, THE FILM INCLUDED A TIRADE BY

NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV THAT, IN THE GOVERNMENT'S WORDS, WAS " VIOLENTLY

HOSTILE TO WEST GERMANY AND TO THE POLICY OF FRANCO-GERMAN

RAPPROCHEMENT . " SAME WEEK, ANOTHER DOCUMENTARY MOVIE, DEATH IN

MADRID, CONSISTING MOSTLY OF STOCK SHOTS TAKEN DURING THE 1936 SPANISH

CIVIL WAR, WAS DENIED A LICENSE FOR EXHIBITION IN FRANCE OR ABROAD

PRESUMABLY FOR FEAR OF OFFENDING FRANCO . ORDERED THE PARIS OPERA TO

CANCEL A PERFORMANCE BY RUDOLF NUREYEV, A RUSSIAN BALLET DANCER WHO

DEFECTED TO THE WEST IN 1961 . THOUGH NUREYEV HAS ALREADY DANCED IN

PARIS, LONDON AND NEW YORK, THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT PLAINLY FELT THAT HIS

APPEARANCE IN PARIS WOULD BE AN AFFRONT TO NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV .

CONFISCATED NEARLY 75,000 COPIES OF A NOVEL, HIGH COURT, IN WHICH

RIGHT-WING AUTHOR ALFRED FABRE-LUCE GIVES A FICTIONAL ACCOUNT OF A

FUTURE TRIAL OF DE GAULLE AS IT MIGHT BE CONDUCTED IF HE WERE IMPEACHED

BY THE SENATE . THE GOVERNMENT'S OBJECT THIS TIME WAS TO AVOID OFFENSE

TO CHARLES DE GAULLE HIMSELF . SOME OF THE GOVERNMENT'S REPRESSIONS ARE

EXPLICABLE AS INTERNATIONAL BACKSCRATCHING . DE GAULLE'S INCREASING

AMIABILITY TOWARD SPAIN HAS BEEN REWARDED BY FRANCO'S JAILING OF SIX

TOP ANTI-GAULLIST TERRORISTS WHO WERE HIDING OUT IN SPAIN . BANNING THE

STALINGRAD SHOW MAY JUST POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN REPAID LAST WEEK WHEN

GERMAN POLICE FAILED TO PREVENT MYSTERIOUS FRENCH AGENTS IN MUNICH FROM

KIDNAPING A TOP S.A.O . LEADER, ANTOINE ARGOUD (SEE BELOW) . BUT IT

SEEMED UNLIKELY THAT KHRUSHCHEV WOULD CARE GREATLY IF NUREYEV DANCED IN

PARIS, OR THAT ADENAUER WOULD OBJECT TO BEING DAMNED BY NIKITA ON TV .

REDRESS, WHO EXPECTS LOGIC ?

JUST AS THE MAN SAID, A SMALL DELIVERY TRUCK WAS PARKED IN THE ALLEY,

AND INSIDE IT THE GENDARMES FOUND A GAGGED, TRUSSED, MIDDLEAGED MAN .

LIFTING THE BLINDFOLD, A COP PEERED AT THE BATTERED, BLOODY FACE AND

NODDED : " IT LOOKS LIKE ARGOUD . " FASCHING FRAWL . EVER SINCE APRIL

1961, EX-COLONEL ANTOINE-CHARLES-LOUIS-MARIE ARGOUD, 48, HAD BEEN ONE

OF THE TERRORIST SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION'S TOP LEADERS . EARLIER, AS A

SECTOR COMMANDER IN ALGERIA, HE WAS FAMED FOR HIS USE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL

WARFARE TACTICS AGAINST THE REBEL F.L.N . AN ARGOUD SPECIALTY :

EXHIBITING IN THE STREETS BODIES OF EXECUTED MOSLEM PRISONERS AS A

WARNING . AFTER LEAVING ALGERIA, HE GREW A BEARD AND SHUTTLED

ANONYMOUSLY BETWEEN ITALY, GERMANY AND SWITZERLAND . ARGOUD HAD ALREADY

BEEN SENTENCED TO DEATH IN ABSENTIA FOR HIS PART IN THE 1961 GENERALS'

PUTSCH, AND, AS A MEMBER OF THE DIEHARD COUNCIL OF NATIONAL RESISTANCE,

IS BELIEVED TO HAVE ORDERED THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF DE GAULLE AT

PETIT-CLAMART, OUTSIDE PARIS, LAST YEAR . SOON AFTER THE PARIS PRESS

HEADLINED THE STORY OF THE ARREST, L'AFFAIRE ARGOUD WAS TURNED INTO A

FIRST-RATE INTERNATIONAL WHODUNIT BY THE OWNER OF MUNICH'S HOTEL EDEN

WOLFF, WHO SAID THAT THE S.A.O . LEADER HAD CHECKED IN THERE THE

PREVIOUS NIGHT . THREE HOURS AFTER HE HAD REGISTERED, SAID THE

HOTELMAN, TWO MEN ENTERED THE LOBBY AND SENT A NOTE UP TO HIS ROOM .

ARGOUD CAME DOWN AND SPOKE TO HIS VISITORS, WHO SHOWED HIM SOMETHING .

ALL THREE STARTED OUT THE DOOR TOGETHER, BUT THEN ARGOUD TRIED TO PULL

AWAY . THE OTHER TWO GRABBED HIM, HAULED HIM OUT TO THE STREET, KNOCKED

HIM DOWN, THREW HIM INTO AN AUTO AND DROVE AWAY . AT THE HEIGHT OF

MUNICH'S RIOTOUS PRE-LENTEN CELEBRATIONS, ANY POLICEMAN MIGHT HAVE

SHRUGGED IT OFF AS JUST ANOTHER FASCHING BRAWL .

LEGENDARY BEARDS . AS THEY READ THE HEADLINES, PARISIANS BEGAN TO

QUESTION THE OFFICIAL VERSION THAT ARGOUD HAD BEEN BETRAYED BY THE

S.A.O . HOW HAD HE BEEN SMUGGLED FROM GERMANY INTO FRANCE ? WAS THE

PHONE CALL REALLY FROM AN S.A.O . MAN ? COULD PIERRE CHATEAU-JOBERT,

THOUGH SUPPOSED TO BE ARGOUD'S RIVAL FOR LEADERSHIP OF THE FOUNDERING

S.A.O., REALLY HAVE BETRAYED A COMRADE IN THIS WAY ? THE NEWSPAPERS

PLUNGED GLEEFULLY INTO THE GUESSING GAME : ARGOUD, THEY SAID, HAD BEEN

CAPTURED BY LES BARBOUZES (THE BEARDED ONES), THE LEGENDARY TRIGGERMEN

OF THE FRENCH SECRET SERVICES . IT WAS SPECULATED THAT THE ESMERALDA

PHONE CALL WAS SIMPLY THE GOVERNMENT'S WAY OF ESTABLISHING AN ALIBI

AFTER ITS AGENTS HAD ILLEGALLY KIDNAPED ARGOUD IN GERMANY .

ARGOUD'S ATTORNEY POINTEDLY CITED TWO

SIMILAR " ILLEGAL " KIDNAPINGS : THAT OF ADOLF EICHMANN BY THE

ISRAELIS AND, EVEN MORE TO THE POINT, THAT OF THE EMIGRE DUKE

D'ENGHIEN, WHO, SUSPECTED OF PLOTTING AGAINST NAPOLEON, WAS SNATCHED IN

GERMANY BY FRENCH POLICE AND THEN TRIED AND EXECUTED . WHATEVER THE

TRUTH OF THE MATTER, PARISIANS AGREED THAT L'AFFAIRE ARGOUD WAS TRULY

ROCAMBOLESQUE, INCREDIBLE . TO CAP IT, POLICE LAST WEEK ROUNDED UP NINE

OTHER S.A.O . MEN IN A PARIS APARTMENT, CHARGED THEM WITH HAVING

PLANNED (THOUGH THEY FAILED EVEN TO ATTEMPT) THE ASSASSINATION OF

PREMIER GEORGES POMPIDOU LAST YEAR . ARGOUD'S ARREST HAD ANOTHER RESULT

: IT CAUSED A ONE-DAY ADJOURNMENT IN THE TRIAL OF NINE DEFENDANTS

(TIME, FEB . 22) ACCUSED OF BEING PART OF THE GANG THAT TRIED TO KILL

DE GAULLE AT PETIT-CLAMART . MEANWHILE, THE GOVERNMENT WILL SEEK TO

ESTABLISH THAT ARGOUD WAS A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL OF NATIONAL

RESISTANCE, WHICH ORDERED THE AMBUSH AT PETIT-CLAMART, AND THE REST OF

FRANCE WILL KEEP GUESSING WHO ACCOMPLISHED ARGOUD'S CAPTURE .

INDIA DATE WITH DESAI TO INDIA'S ABLE FINANCE MINISTER MORARJI

DESAI, AUSTERITY IS A WAY OF LIFE . NOT ONLY IS HE A VEGETARIAN AND A

TEETOTALER WHO FASTS FOR A DAY AND A HALF EVERY WEEK, BUT HE IS ALSO A

HARDHEADED FISCAL CONSERVATIVE WHO DERIDES PIE-IN-THE-SKY WELFARE

SCHEMES AND IS AN ARDENT BELIEVER IN PAY-AS-YOU-GO FINANCING . LAST

WEEK DESAI PRESENTED THE INDIAN PARLIAMENT WITH AN AUSTERITY BUDGET

THAT WILL PUT THE ENTIRE NATION ON THE DESAI STANDARD . TO FINANCE

INDIA'S HERCULEAN TASK OF EQUIPPING ITS ARMED FORCES AGAINST THE

CONTINUING THREAT OF CHINESE AGGRESSION, DESAI BOOSTED THE BUDGET BY A

STAGGERING 33 PER CENT TO A RECORD $3.8 BILLION ; DEFENSE EXPENDITURES

ALONE JUMPED 70 PER CENT, TO $1.8 BILLION . BUT DESAI REFUSED TO

SQUEEZE THE MONEY OUT OF THE GOVERNMENT'S COSTLY FIVE-YEAR PLAN OR EVEN

TO RELY ON LARGE-SCALE DEFICIT FINANCING . THE COST WILL BE BORNE BY

INDIA'S POPULATION WHOSE PER CAPITA INCOME LAST YEAR WAS $69 . PERSONAL

INCOME TAXES IN THE LOWER BRACKETS WILL BE INCREASED AS MUCH AS 450 PER

CENT . IMPORT DUTIES ON MOST RAW MATERIALS, MACHINERY AND MANUFACTURED

GOODS WILL BE BOOSTED FROM 15 PER CENT TO 55 PER CENT . ALL OF INDIA'S

TAXPAYERS WILL HAVE TO DEPOSIT UP TO 3 PER CENT OF THEIR AFTER-TAX

INCOMES IN GOVERNMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS ; BUSINESSES WHOSE AFTER-TAX

INCOMES EXCEED 6 PER CENT OF THEIR CAPITAL VALUE MUST PAY A 50 PER CENT

TAX ON ALL SUBSEQUENT PROFITS . ALL BASIC HOUSEHOLD GOODS, CLOTH, FOOD

AND COOKING FUELS WILL BE HIT WITH NEW TAXES . ONLY EXCEPTIONS :

SUGAR, SHOES, RICE AND MATCHES . ADVERSE REACTION TO THE BUDGET WAS

SURPRISINGLY MILD . SOME BUSINESSMEN PROTESTED THAT DESAI COULD HAVE

EASED THE TAX BURDEN BY SLASHING UNNECESSARY GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES ;

OTHERS POINTED OUT THAT INDIA MIGHT HAVE BEEN SPARED THE CRUSHING NEW

TAXES IF THE GOVERNMENT HAD SPENT ENOUGH MONEY IN THE PAST TO HAVE MADE

A MORE CREDITABLE SHOWING AGAINST THE CHINESE . GRUMBLED ONE : " THIS

IS A HIGH PRICE TO PAY FOR LADAKH EVEN ASSUMING WE DO GET IT BACK . "

BUT MOST INDIANS CLOSED RANKS BEHIND DESAI . SAID ONE GOVERNMENT

OFFICIAL : " THE BUDGET IS THE CLEAREST ANSWER YET GIVEN BY AN ASIAN

DEMOCRACY TO COMMUNIST EXPANSION . /

DENMARK CUTTING BACK WITH KRAG

NO ASCETIC IS DENMARK'S

AND AN EYE FOR PRETTY WOMEN, HE HAS BEEN MARRIED TWICE : FIRST TO

SWEDISH ACTRESS BIRGIT TENGROTH, CURRENTLY TO DANISH MOVIE STAR HELLE

VIRKNER, WHO HAS BEEN NAMED AS ONE OF EUROPE'S TEN MOST ATTRACTIVE

WOMEN . IN COPENHAGEN LAST WEEK, AFTER ONLY SIX MONTHS IN OFFICE, KRAG

FACED HIS SUPREME POLITICAL TEST WHEN HE INTRODUCED INTO PARLIAMENT A

COMPLEX SERIES OF MEASURES THAT WILL 1) EXTEND ALL UNION CONTRACTS FOR

TWO YEARS, THUS LIMITING WAGE INCREASES ; 2) FIX MAXIMUM PRICES OF ALL

CONSUMER GOODS EXCEPT FISH AND FARM PRODUCTS ; AND 3) COMPEL ALL

TAXPAYERS TO BUY UP TO $290 IN 4 PER CENT BONDS THAT CANNOT BE REDEEMED

FOR FIVE YEARS . A TRAINED ECONOMIST, KRAG INSISTED THAT HIS DRACONIAN

MEASURES ARE ESSENTIAL ; MORE THAN ANY OTHER NATION IN EUROPE, DENMARK

HAD STAKED ITS ECONOMIC FUTURE ON JOINING THE COMMON MARKET ALONG WITH

BRITAIN . WHEN DE GAULLE BLACKBALLED BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP, FRANCE'S

PRESIDENT SHREWDLY PROMISED DENMARK IMMEDIATE ADMISSION . KRAG'S REPLY

WAS SHARP AND TO THE POINT : " WE HAVE NO WISH TO BE ONE OF PRESIDENT

DE GAULLE'S PIECES IN THE POLITICAL CHESS GAME WITH BRITAIN . IT IS

IMPORTANT THAT WE KEEP OUR TWO MAJOR CUSTOMERS, BRITAIN AND WEST

GERMANY, INSIDE THE SAME ORGANIZATION . IT MUST BE OUR PURPOSE IN ALL

FIELDS TO SEE THAT NEGOTIATIONS FOR A UNIFIED EUROPE GO ON . " BUT

KRAG'S LOYALTY TO HIS FRIENDS ABROAD HARDLY ALLAYED HIS HEADACHES AT

HOME . RACKED BY SEVERE INFLATION, DENMARK LAST YEAR SAW ITS TRADE

DEFICIT DANGEROUSLY INCREASED TO $486 MILLION, WHILE ITS CURRENCY

RESERVES WERE CUT IN HALF . IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS, DANISH WAGES HAVE

RISEN 40 PER CENT , PRODUCTION LESS THAN 20 PER CENT . THE STRINGENT

NEW ECONOMIC PROGRAM DREW ANGUISHED CRIES FROM EMPLOYERS AND THE

POLITICAL OPPOSITION, BUT KRAG CURTLY REJECTED THE TRADITIONAL DANISH

COMPROMISE . KRAG'S COALITION GOVERNMENT CAN UNDOUBTEDLY SQUEEZE THE

BILL THROUGH PARLIAMENT BY ITS USUAL ONE-VOTE MAJORITY, AND THE DANES

WILL HAVE TO TIGHTEN THEIR BELTS FOR YEARS OF AUSTERITY AHEAD .

SOUTH KOREA OVER TO YOU, GENTLEMEN TO ALL OUTWARD APPEARANCES,

SOUTH KOREA'S RULING MILITARY JUNTA HAS WIELDED IRON-FISTED CONTROL

OVER THE COUNTRY SINCE IT SEIZED POWER IN A LIGHTNING COUP NEARLY TWO

YEARS AGO . UNDER STRONGMAN GENERAL PARK CHUNG HEE, THE GOVERNMENT

STIFLED ALL OPPOSITION ; NEWSPAPERS WERE GAGGED, AND 4,000 KNOWN

POLITICAL OPPONENTS OF THE REGIME WERE FORBIDDEN TO CRITICIZE IT IN

PUBLIC . BUT PARK HAS BEEN LESS SUCCESSFUL IN QUELLING DISAFFECTION

WITHIN HIS OWN JUNTA . LAST WEEK THE WRANGLING WAS OUT IN THE OPEN,

THREATENING TO PLUNGE SOUTH KOREA INTO YET ANOTHER FULL-SCALE

CRISIS . SNOOPER BOSS . PARK'S GENERALS BECAME OPENLY RESTIVE SOON

AFTER HIS DECISION TO RESTORE CIVILIAN POLITICAL RULE (TIME, DEC . 28),

AT LEAST IN NAME . IN FACT, JUNTA MEMBERS PLANNED MERELY TO SWAP THEIR

KHAKI FOR MUFTI AND CONTINUE TO RUN THE COUNTRY ; PARK HIMSELF WAS THE

LEADING CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY . THIS PLEASANT PROSPECT WAS

SHATTERED LAST JANUARY WHEN BRIGADIER GENERAL KIM CHONG PIL, HUSBAND OF

PARK'S NIECE AND BOSS OF THE DREADED CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY, QUIT

THE C.I.A .  IN ORDER TO GRAB CONTROL OF THE REGIME'S CIVILIAN

POLITICAL ORGANIZATION, THE DEMOCRATIC-REPUBLICAN PARTY WITH PARK'S

TACIT APPROVAL KIM WHOSE 30,000 SNOOPERS HAD KEPT  TABS ON ANYTHING

AND ANYONE THE JUNTA MIGHT DISTRUST INCLUDING MEMBERS OF THE JUNTA

INFILTRATED THE PARTY'S POWER POSITIONS WITH 1,200 OF HIS FORMER C.I.A

AGENTS., JUNTA MEMBERS OBJECTED TO KIM'S POWER GRAB AS A BLATANT

ATTEMPT TO CUT THEM OUT OF THE LION'S SHARE OF THE SPOILS . WHEN THEY

INSISTED THAT PARK FIRE KIM FROM THE PARTY LEADERSHIP, PARK RETALIATED

BY SACKING FOUR OF KIM'S BITTEREST FOES FROM THE JUNTA . BUT THE FOUR,

ALL HIGH-RANKING OFFICERS, THREATENED TO PLUNGE SOUTH KOREA INTO CIVIL

WAR UNLESS PARK BROUGHT KIM TO HEEL . " THE ENTIRE ARMY IS AGAINST YOU,

ONE OFFICER TOLD PARK . " YOU CANNOT WIN . " FAILED OBJECTIVE . PARK

FINALLY CAPITULATED . HE FORCED KIM TO RESIGN HIS PARTY POST, LAST WEEK

SENT HIM ON A 50-DAY FOREIGN INSPECTION TRIP AS HIS " AMBASSADOR

PLENIPOTENTIARY . " NO SOONER HAD KIM LEFT THAN INVESTIGATORS BEGAN

EXPLORING RUMORS THAT HE HAD USED HIS POWERFUL C.I.A . JOB TO MAKE A

STOCK MARKET KILLING AND TO MULCT KICKBACKS FROM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS

. BEFORE 3,000 SCREAMING POLITICIANS IN SEOUL'S CITIZENS HALL, PARK

ANNOUNCED GRIMLY THAT HE WAS BOWING OUT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE . " I

CANNOT HELP ADMITTING, " HE SAID, " THAT THE REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT

HAS FAILED COMPLETELY IN ACHIEVING ITS POLITICAL OBJECTIVE THE

EMERGENCE OF NEW POLITICAL PERSONALITIES . " CERTAINLY, PARK'S

WITHDRAWAL AND KIM'S FALL FROM GRACE FAILED TO TURN UP ANY PROMISING

NEW POLITICAL LEADERS THE JUNTA-CONTROLLED DEMOCRATIC-REPUBLICAN PARTY

IS IN FLOUNDERING DISARRAY WHILE THE THREE OTHER MAJOR CIVILIAN PARTIES

WHICH ARE ALSO RIVEN BY INTERNAL DISSENSION, LACK ANY BROAD BASE OF

POPULAR SUPPORT . THUS, FEW SOUTH KOREANS EXPECT THAT PARK WILL REMAIN

LONG IN THE WINGS . WITH INFLATION RAMPANT AND UNEMPLOYMENT AT A RECORD

HIGH, MANY POLITICIANS SUSPECT THAT PARK IS DELIBERATELY SADDLING THEM

WITH CHAOS, THAT IN HIS OWN GOOD TIME, HE MAY ONCE AGAIN " SAVE " THE

COUNTRY .

YEMEN FOR ALLAH & THE IMAM FROM REMOTE YEMEN LAST

SEPTEMBER CAME WORD OF A REVOLUTION THAT HAD TOPPLED THE CENTURIES-OLD

DYNASTY OF IMAM MOHAMMED EL BADR . LEADER OF THE COUP WAS COLONEL

ANNOUNCED IN THE YEMEN CAPITAL OF SAN " A THAT HIS TROOPS HAD KILLED

THE IMAM AND WERE IN CONTROL OF THE PRIMITIVE, NEBRASKA-SIZED COUNTRY .

WEEKS LATER IT WAS LEARNED THAT BADR HAD IN FACT ESCAPED THE SHELLED

RUINS OF HIS PALACE AND TAKEN REFUGE IN YEMEN'S RUGGED HILL COUNTRY,

WHOSE WARLIKE TRIBES HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN LOYAL TO THE IMAM .

CLOUDED CLAIMS . EVER SINCE, HELPED BY MONEY AND SUPPLIES FROM THE

UNEASY MONARCHS OF SAUDI ARABIA AND JORDAN, THE IMAM AND HIS TRIBAL

WARRIORS HAVE BEEN INCHING DOGGEDLY BACK TOWARD SAN " A . PRESIDENT

SALLAL APPEALED FOR HELP TO EGYPT'S GAMAL ABDEL NASSER, AN OLD FRIEND

OF THE IMAM BUT AN EVEN MORE IMPLACABLE FOE OF THE OIL-RICH DESERT

DYNASTIES WHO WERE HELPING BADR . NASSER RUSHED IN EGYPTIAN TROOPS,

WHOSE SOVIET-MADE GUNS, TANKS AND JETS MAKE THEM THE ARAB WORLD'S MOST

FORMIDABLE FIGHTING FORCE . THOUGH THE REPUBLICANS HAD NOT IN FACT WON

THE WHOLE COUNTRY, THE U.S . DECIDED RELUCTANTLY LAST DECEMBER TO

RECOGNIZE SALLAL'S REGIME, HAVING FIRST WON NASSER'S PROMISE TO

WITHDRAW HIS TROOPS . EGYPT'S PRESIDENT HAS NOT ONLY FAILED TO HONOR

HIS PLEDGE BUT HAS ACTUALLY RAISED THE EXPEDITIONARY FORCE TO 23,000

TROOPS ON THE PRETEXT THAT BRITAIN, SAUDI ARABIA AND JORDAN HAVE ALL

SENT IN FORCES TO HELP THE IMAM . BRITAIN, WHICH HAS NOT RECOGNIZED

SALLAL, FEARS THAT EGYPTIAN PENETRATION OF THE ARABIAN PENINSULA WILL

ISOLATE ITS OILFIELDS AND DEAL A CRIPPLING BLOW TO ITS ECONOMY .

IS TRUSTED BY BOTH SIDES, TO DISCUSS A SOLUTION WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF

SALLAL AND THE IMAM ; FROM YEMEN HE WILL GO TO EGYPT, SAUDI ARABIA AND

JORDAN . THE ACTUAL COURSE OF THE FIGHTING HAS BEEN CLOUDED BY THE

GRANDIOSE CLAIMS OF BOTH SIDES AND THE FORMIDABLE OBSTACLES THAT FACE

WESTERN NEWSMEN WHO EVEN TRY TO GET INTO YEMEN, LET ALONE REACH THE

BATTLE LINES . ONE WHO SUCCEEDED WAS TIME CORRESPONDENT GEORGE DE

CARVALHO . FROM BEIRUT LAST WEEK HE CABLED HIS REPORT ON A 23-DAY TREK

IN WHICH HE CROSSED THE PEAKS, PLATEAUS AND WADIS FROM ADEN TO THE

SAUDI ARABIAN BORDER, TRAVELING A TOTAL OF 1,000 MILES BY CAMEL,

DONKEY, CAR AND SHOE LEATHER WITHOUT ONCE LEAVING ROYALISTHELD

TERRITORY (SEE MAP) . ALONG THE WAY, CORRESPONDENT DE CARVALHO WAS

REPEATEDLY SHOT AT BY EGYPTIAN FIGHTER PLANES, TANKS, MORTARS, AND

ARTILLERY, SAW TWO OF HIS SIX YEMENI GUARDS KILLED AND ONE WOUNDED IN

BATTLE . RIFLES & FAITH . THE FIGHTING IS MOST INTENSE IN A 70-MILE ARC

CURVING AROUND THE EASTERN APPROACHES TO SAN " A . IN MOST AREAS, THE

ROYALISTS LIMIT THEMSELVES TO HIT-AND-RUN GUERRILLA RAIDS, BUT HERE

THEY ARE TAKING AND HOLDING GROUND, ATTACKING STEADILY AND ADVANCING ON

A WIDE FRONT . REPORTS DE CARVALHO : " THE INCREDIBLE FACT IS THAT THE

EGYPTIANS ARE LOSING IN YEMEN . RAGGED, BAREFOOT YEMENI TRIBESMEN,

ARMED ONLY WITH ANCIENT RIFLES AND FAITH IN ALLAH, ARE KICKING HELL OUT

OF NASSER'S ELITE TROOPS DESPITE THEIR OVERPOWERING SOVIET EQUIPMENT,

OVERWHELMINGLY SUPERIOR FIREPOWER, AND UNCHALLENGED AIRPOWER . "

THE WAR IN YEMEN IS BEING FOUGHT BETWEEN

THE 10TH CENTURY AND THE 20TH . THE MOUNTAIN TRIBES HAVE NO OFFICERS'

CORPS OR NONCOMS ; THEY SIMPLY CHOOSE THEIR SHEIKS AND FOLLOW THEM

INTO BATTLE . " WE CAPTURED 14 FIELD RADIOS, " SIGHED PRINCE ABDULLAH

IBN HASSAN, 25, A COUSIN OF THE IMAM . " BUT NONE OF MY MEN KNOW HOW TO

USE THEM . " NOR CAN THEY USE CAPTURED TANKS OR TRUCKS, SINCE NONE OF

THE TRIBESMEN KNOW HOW TO DRIVE . WHEN THEY ATTACK A TANK, THE

TRIBESMEN FIRST KILL OFF THE ACCOMPANYING INFANTRYMEN, THEN OFTEN SET

IT AFIRE WITH FLAMING CORN STALKS . THE EGYPTIANS ARE RESTRICTED TO THE

FEW ROUGH ROADS AND DEPEND ON DAILY DELIVERY OF SUPPLIES, WHILE THE

ROYALISTS CAN FIGHT ANYWHERE . SAYS PRINCE ABDULLAH : " ALL MY MEN

NEED IS BREAD AND BULLETS . WE WILL FIGHT UNTIL WE ARE ALL DEAD OR THE

EGYPTIANS ARE DRIVEN INTO THE SEA . WE BOW ONLY TO GOD . " PLASTERED

SKIRMISHERS . YEMEN'S ROADS AND FIELDS ARE LITTERED WITH THE REMAINS OF

MIRAN . SAID HE : " ABOUT 25 MILES FROM SAN'A WE WERE AMBUSHED . MY

COMPANY NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO FIGHT . IN A FEW HOURS, MORE THAN 100 OF

US WERE KILLED, AND I SURRENDERED . " NASSER HAS APPARENTLY HAD TO CALL

UP THE RESERVES . COMPLAINED SERGEANT IBRAHIM MOHSIN ALKATI, 32, WHO

WAS A CAIRO TRUCK MECHANIC BEFORE HE WAS RECALLED TO DUTY : " I DIDN'T

EVEN KNOW THERE WAS A WAR ON IN YEMEN . I THOUGHT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO

HELP TRAIN THE YEMENI REPUBLICAN ARMY . " ONE BATTLE WITNESSED BY

CORRESPONDENT DE CARVALHO WAS AT EL ARGOUP, 25 MILES SOUTHEAST OF

SAN'A, WHERE 500 YEMENIS COMMANDED BY PRINCE ABDULLAH ATTACKED AN

EGYPTIAN POSITION ON TOP OF A SHEERSIDED HILL THAT WAS FORTIFIED WITH

SIX SOVIET T-54 TANKS, A DOZEN ARMORED CARS AND ENTRENCHED MACHINE GUNS

. THE YEMENIS, ADVANCING IN A THIN SKIRMISH LINE, WERE PLASTERED BY

ARTILLERY, MORTARS AND STRAFING PLANES . THEY COULD REPLY ONLY WITH

RIFLES, ONE MORTAR WITH 20 ROUNDS, AND A BAZOOKA WITH FOUR ROUNDS

HANDLED BY A MAN WHO HAD NEVER FIRED A BAZOOKA BEFORE IN HIS LIFE . THE

FIGHT FOR EL ARGOUP LASTED A WEEK AND ENDED IN A ROUT THAT COST THE

EGYPTIANS THREE TANKS, SEVEN ARMORED CARS AND 160 DEAD . DE CARVALHO

ASKED A HAGGARD SHEIK IF HIS MEN SUFFERED FROM BATTLE FATIGUE . THE

SHEIK FROWNED : " WE SUFFER FROM MANY DISEASES IN YEMEN, BUT BATTLE

FATIGUE WHAT IS THAT ? " THE TRIBESMEN'S LOYALTY TO THE IMAM IS NOT

ALWAYS EASY TO UNDERSTAND . MANY OF THE PRESENT ROYALIST LEADERS

SUFFERED CRUELLY DURING THE 14-YEAR REIGN OF BADR'S FATHER, AHMAD THE

DEVIL, WHOSE WAY OF PACIFYING THE HILL TRIBES WAS TO TAKE MASS HOSTAGES

AND BEHEAD RESTIVE SHEIKS . SHRUGGED ONE SHEIK : " THE IMAMS HAVE

RULED US FOR A THOUSAND YEARS . SOME WERE GOOD AND SOME BAD . WE KILLED

THE BAD ONES SOONER OR LATER, AND WE PROSPERED UNDER THE GOOD ONES . "

ANOTHER REASON FOR FIGHTING THE REPUBLICANS IS THAT THE HILL TRIBES

BELONG TO THE MOSLEM SHIA SECT, OF WHICH THE IMAM IS THE RELIGIOUS HEAD

. THE YEMENIS OF THE COAST AND THE SOUTH BELONG TO THE RIVAL SUNNI SECT

(AS DO MOST EGYPTIANS) . THOUGH PRESIDENT SALLAL IS HIMSELF A MOUNTAIN

SHIA, IT IS HIS MISFORTUNE TO BE FIGHTING THE FIERCE MOUNTAIN SHIAS

WITH LOWLAND SUNNIS WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN FAMED FOR MARTIAL PROWESS . THE

IMAM MOHAMMED EL BADR IS A HUSKY, HARD-LOOKING MAN OF 36 WHO ROVES

CONSTANTLY ALONG THE NORTHWEST FRONT IN A DODGE WAGON AND NEVER SLEEPS

MORE THAN TWO NIGHTS IN THE SAME PLACE . IN A WADI UNDER THE STARS ONE

NIGHT, HE TOLD DE CARVALHO :. " NASSER'S BIGGEST SINGLE TARGET IN

YEMEN IS ME . " WAVING AT THE SKIES FROM WHICH EGYPTIAN JETS HAD

POUNCED ON HIS FORCES ONLY THAT DAY, HE SIGHED : " NOW I'M GETTING MY

REWARD FOR BEFRIENDING NASSER . WE WERE BROTHERS, BUT WHEN I REFUSED TO

BECOME HIS STOOGE, HE USED SALLAL AGAINST ME . I WILL NEVER STOP

FIGHTING . I WILL NEVER GO INTO EXILE . WIN OR LOSE, MY GRAVE WILL BE

HERE . " BY LAST WEEK THE WAR SEEMED DEADLOCKED . HOWEVER, IMAM

MOHAMMED IS TRYING TO RECRUIT A MERCENARY AIR FORCE, AND IS BUILDING UP

A SMALL STOCK OF ANTITANK GUNS, RECOILLESS RIFLES AND MORTARS . SAUDI

ARABIA, WHICH HAS BANKROLLED THE ROYALISTS SO FAR WITH ABOUT $15

MILLION, IS ITCHING TO PLUNGE INTO THE FIGHT . IN THE WAKE OF REPEATED

BOMBINGS OF SAUDI TOWNS, SAUDI ARABIA'S PREMIER PRINCE FEISAL WARNED

U.S . DIPLOMATS : " I CANNOT SIT MUCH LONGER WITH MY ARMS FOLDED WHILE

NASSER ATTACKS NOT ONLY MY NEIGHBOR YEMEN BUT ALSO MY OWN COUNTRY . "

MIDDLE EAST SPREADING INFECTION IN THE

MIDDLE EAST, REVOLUTION IS REACHING EPIDEMIC PROPORTIONS . A REVOLT IN

YEMEN LAST SEPTEMBER OUSTED THE CENTURIES-OLD DYNASTY OF THE IMAM AND

INSTALLED A " REPUBLIC " THAT HAS EVER SINCE BEEN PROPPED UP BY 20,000

EGYPTIAN TROOPS SENT IN BY GAMAL ABDEL NASSER . IN TWO BLOODY DAYS'

WORK LAST MONTH, IRAQI ARMY OFFICERS DEPOSED AND KILLED PSYCHOTIC

DICTATOR ABDUL KARIM KASSEM . LAST WEEK, ON A QUIET, GREY FRIDAY

MORNING, THE INFECTION REACHED SYRIA . BROKEN BONDS . EVERYONE KNEW IT

WAS COMING, FROM SYRIA'S STRONGMAN, GENERAL ABDEL KARIM ZAHREDDIN, DOWN

TO THE LOWLIEST PRIVATE IN THE ARMY . WHEN ZAHREDDIN SEVERED SYRIA'S

UNION WITH EGYPT 17 MONTHS AGO, HE HAD PROFITED FROM THE NATION'S

REVULSION AGAINST THE POLICE STATE AND HARSH ECONOMIC CONTROLS IMPOSED

BY NASSER . BUT SYRIANS, PASSIONATE BELIEVERS IN ARAB UNITY, ALSO FELT

GUILTY ABOUT BREAKING THE BONDS . WISPY PRESIDENT NAZEM EL-KOUDSI

SIGHED, " THE TROUBLE WITH SYRIANS IS THAT WE ARE NEVER CONCERNED WITH

JUST OUR OWN PROBLEMS BUT WITH ISSUES AFFECTING ALL ARABS . " THE

REGIME SURVIVED THREE MAJOR AND COUNTLESS MINOR CONSPIRACIES, BUT ONCE

IRAQ REBELLED AGAINST DICTATOR KASSEM IN THE NAME OF ARAB UNITY, THE

SYRIAN REGIME WAS DOOMED . SIX CABINET MINISTERS RESIGNED DISCREETLY,

AND WHEN MEMBERS OF THE BAATH (RENAISSANCE) PARTY WERE ASKED TO REPLACE

THEM, THEY REFUSED . DESPERATE PRESIDENT KOUDSI EAGERLY OFFERED TO

UNITE SYRIA WITH THE NEW REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ BUT RECEIVED

NO OFFICIAL REPLY FROM BAGHDAD . SCHOOLS WERE CLOSED TO PREVENT STUDENT

DEMONSTRATIONS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT, AND TANKS AND ARMORED CARS

PATROLLED THE STREETS OF DAMASCUS . THE REVOLUTION CAME AS QUIETLY AS A

SUNRISE . GENERAL ZAHREDDIN SUSPECTED COLONEL MOHAMMED HARIRI, CHIEF OF

THE SOUTHERN FRONT COMMAND, OF BEING A TOP CONSPIRATOR AND ORDERED HIM

SENT OUT OF THE COUNTRY AS MILITARY ATTACHE TO JORDAN . HARIRI REFUSED

TO GO, AND THE ENTIRE SOUTHERN COMMAND BACKED HIM UP . AN ARMORED

COLUMN MOVED OUT FROM THE BADANI MILITARY CAMP AND ENTERED DAMASCUS,

WHERE THE TANKS PATROLLING THE STREETS QUICKLY JOINED THE REBELS .

SCARCELY A SHOT WAS FIRED AS SYRIA CHANGED ITS ALLEGIANCE . TEMPERS

WERE SO COOL THAT PRESIDENT KOUDSI WAS ALLOWED TO REMAIN AT HOME WITH

HIS FAMILY . PREMIER KHALED EL-AZM, WHO LIVED BESIDE THE TURKISH

EMBASSY, SIMPLY SLIPPED NEXT DOOR AND WAS GIVEN POLITICAL ASYLUM .

DAMASCUS RADIO WENT ON THE AIR PROCLAIMING THE BAATHIST SLOGANS OF "

UNITY, FREEDOM, SOCIALISM ! " A JUBILANT SYRIAN ARMY OFFICER AT A

BORDER POST SAID, " WE WANT UNITY, NOT WITH NASSER, BUT WITH ALL ARABS

. " AS IN IRAQ, THE SYRIAN NATIONAL COUNCIL OF THE REVOLUTIONARY

COMMAND INSISTED ON ANONYMITY . THE NEW 20-MAN CABINET HAS ONLY TWO

MILITARY MEN, AND THE BAATH PARTY IS STRONGLY REPRESENTED . NEW PREMIER

SALAH EL-BITAR, 45, IS A FORMER SYRIAN FOREIGN MINISTER AND A BAATHIST

WITH STRONG SYMPATHIES TOWARD ARAB UNITY . A TALL, HULKING DAMASCENE

WITH DARK, BROODING EYES AND BRILLIANTINED HAIR, HE ONCE SIGNED A

MANIFESTO DENOUNCING UNION WITH EGYPT, BUT LATER ADVOCATED CLOSE

FEDERAL TIES .

TWO IN ONE . TWO REVOLUTIONS WITHIN A

SINGLE MONTH HAVE THUS PUT THE BAATHISTS INTO POWER IN TWO NATIONS

STRETCHING FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN TO THE PERSIAN GULF . THE BAATH PARTY

STRONGLY EMPHASIZES UNITY WITH ALL ARAB STATES, INCLUDING EGYPT, BUT

REJECTS DICTATORSHIP BY ANYONE, INCLUDING NASSER . ITS PHILOSOPHY CALLS

FOR ITTIHAD, LOOSE FEDERATION, AND PLEDGES OVERALL ALLEGIANCE TO URUBA,

A PERVASIVE PANARABISM . WHEN NEWS OF THE SYRIAN REVOLT REACHED THE

IRAQI CAPITAL OF BAGHDAD, A MILITARY PARADE WAS TRANSFORMED INTO A

VICTORY CELEBRATION, WITH LONG LINES OF CITIZENS AND STUDENTS

SNAKE-DANCING THROUGH THE CITY . IN CAIRO, NASSER'S MEN HAILED THE NEW

SYRIAN REGIME . IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT NASSER WILL PROFIT FROM HIS PAST

MISTAKES AND SETTLE FOR A COALITION OF " LIBERATED " ARAB STATES

GOVERNED BY BAATHISTS AND PRO-NASSERITES BUT RETAINING THEIR SEPARATE

IDENTITIES AND SOVEREIGNTIES . THE REVOLUTIONARY WAVE NEXT THREATENS

THE MONARCHIES OF JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA, WHICH HAVE BITTERLY OPPOSED

NASSER'S INTERVENTION IN YEMEN AND HAVE NO LOVE FOR THE UNITY PROPOSALS

OF THE BAATH PARTY . THE BELEAGUERED KINGDOMS LAST WEEK SEEMED TO BE

GIRDING FOR A LAST-DITCH STAND . KING HUSSEIN ALERTED HIS ARAB LEGION,

THE MOST EFFICIENT FIGHTING FORCE IN THE ARAB WORLD . PRINCE FEISAL,

PREMIER OF SAUDI ARABIA, PROTESTED THAT EGYPTIAN PLANES HAD BOMBED

SAUDI TOWNS ON THE YEMEN BORDER AND ANGRILY DECLARED, " LET THE WORLD

KNOW THAT WE ARE NOT AFRAID OF WAR . WE SAUDIS ARE INDEED THE CHILDREN

OF WAR . IF WE HAVE TO DIE, THEN LET US DIE WITH HONOR . UNLESS THESE

ATTACKS, PROVOCATIONS AND CHILDISH ACTS END, THEN THIS COUNTRY WILL

TURN THE TABLES AND TURN THE AGGRESSORS HEAD OVER HEELS . " POSITIVE

WAY . THE UNITED NATIONS' SPECIAL ENVOY TO THE MIDDLE EAST, DR . RALPH

BUNCHE, LAST WEEK VISITED THE REPUBLICAN AREAS OF YEMEN AS PART OF THE

U.N . EFFORT TO PREVENT THE ARKANSAS-SIZED NATION FROM BECOMING AN

INTERNATIONAL BATTLEGROUND . YEMEN HAD DELAYED BUNCHE'S VISIT UNTIL AN

EGYPTIAN ARMORED COLUMN COULD SEIZE THE FORMERLY ROYALIST-HELD TOWN OF

MARIB, AND THEN EXHIBITED IT TO BUNCHE AS EVIDENCE OF REPUBLICAN

CONTROL OF THE COUNTRY . AFTER A 60-MINUTE SESSION WITH YEMEN'S

STRONGMAN ABDULLAH SALLAL, BUNCHE DECLARED, " I WAS MOST IMPRESSED BY

HIS EARNESTNESS, SINCERITY, STRENGTH AND SERIOUSNESS OF PURPOSE . "

STOPPING OFF IN CAIRO ON HIS WAY HOME,

BUNCHE CONFERRED FOR TWO HOURS WITH NASSER, THEN SAW NEWSMEN . HE

EMPHASIZED THAT THE YEMENI PEOPLE HE SAW SUPPORTED SALLAL'S GOVERNMENT

/ IN A POSITIVE WAY . " THE RADIO VOICE OF THE ROYALIST TRIBESMEN

FIGHTING TO RESTORE THE IMAM PLAINTIVELY BEGGED BUNCHE TO VISIT THE

AREAS THEY CONTROLLED " AND SEE THE REAL TRUTH SEE THE ROADS, RAVINES

AND MOUNTAINS OF YEMEN LITTERED WITH EGYPTIAN DEAD . " BUT, ON THIS

TRIP AT LEAST, RALPH BUNCHE WAS SATISFIED TO DRAW HIS CONCLUSIONS FROM

ONE SIDE ONLY . LATER, THE U.N . LET IT BE KNOWN THAT HE PLANS TO VISIT

THE IMAM ON A SEPARATE JOURNEY IN THE NEAR FUTURE . HARD LOOK . IN

1958, THE LAST TIME THERE WAS A BIG REVOLUTIONARY CRISIS IN THE MIDDLE

EAST, THE U.S . RUSHED 14,000 MARINES AND TROOPS TO LEBANON . LAST WEEK

THE U.S . ROLE WAS FAR MORE AMBIVALENT . WASHINGTON SENT A MESSAGE TO

NASSER EXPRESSING " GRAVE CONCERN " AT CONTINUED EGYPTIAN BOMBING OF

SAUDI ARABIA . INSTEAD OF MARINES, THE U.S . SENT VETERAN DIPLOMAT

ELLSWORTH BUNKER TO SAUDI ARABIA TO REASSURE THE UNDERSTANDABLY NERVOUS

PRINCE FEISAL . U.S . POLICY SEEMS AIMED AT SAFEGUARDING THE

TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA FROM AGGRESSION BEYOND

THEIR BORDERS, NOT IN MAINTAINING THE MONARCHS IN POWER AGAINST THEIR

OWN PEOPLE . IN ISRAEL, PREMIER DAVID BENGURION INTERRUPTED A VACATION

TO CONFER WITH HIS DEFENSE CHIEFS . THE REVOLUTION IN SYRIA IS UNLIKELY

TO BE THE FINAL FIRECRACKER ON THE STRING . BAATHIST AND NASSERITE

ELEMENTS ARE KNOWN TO BE AT WORK IN JORDAN, ESPECIALLY AMONG THE

PALESTINIAN ARABS . SAUDI ARABIA CAN NO LONGER TRUST ITS SMALL AIR

FORCE OR EVEN THE OFFICER CORPS OF ITS REGULAR ARMY . IF IT COMES TO

FIGHTING, THE SAUDI RULERS WILL DEPEND ON THEIR " WHITE ARMY, " THE

BEDOUIN TRIBESMEN TRADITIONALLY LOYAL TO THE KING . BUT IF THE ROAD

AHEAD LOOKS ROUGH FOR THE MONARCHIES, IT BY NO MEANS IS SMOOTH FOR THE

/ LIBERATED " STATES, SINCE VICTORY MOST OFTEN PRESENTS ONLY NEW

OCCASIONS FOR QUARRELS, IN KEEPING WITH THE ARAB PROVERB THAT SAYS, " I

AND MY BROTHER AGAINST MY COUSIN ; I AND MY COUSIN AGAINST THE

FRANCE TO THE MINES ! FOR ALL THE EXCITED HEADLINES,

S.A.O . TERRORISM WAS HARDLY CHARLES DE GAULLE'S MAIN CONCERN LAST WEEK

. FAR GRAVER WAS THE CHALLENGE TO HIS AUTHORITY POSED BY FRANCE'S

ECONOMY . IT TOOK THE FORM OF A SPREADING LABOR STRIKE LED BY 188,000

STUBBORN MINERS CONCENTRATED IN THE GRIM COAL DISTRICTS OF NORTHERN

FRANCE . THREE RIVAL UNIONS (ROMAN CATHOLIC, SOCIALIST, COMMUNIST) WERE

OUT OF THE PITS IN A JOINT DEMAND FOR A 12 PER CENT PAY BOOST TO

COMPENSATE FOR THE CREEPING INFLATION THAT HAS WIPED OUT MUCH OF THEIR

PURCHASING POWER IN THE PAST THREE YEARS . DE GAULLE'S REPLY WAS IN THE

AUTHORITARIAN TRADITION OF AN ANGRY OLD SOLDIER . HE PUT HIS SIGNATURE

TO A SPECIAL DECREE THAT HAS THE EFFECT OF DRAFTING THE STRIKERS INTO

THE NATIONAL SERVICEORDERS CAN BE SIGNED BY THE PREMIER ; BY ISSUING

IT HIMSELF, DE GAULLE PUT HIS OWN PRESTIGE ON THE LINE AGAINST THE

STRIKERS . AS STRATEGISTS, THE MINERS TURNED OUT TO BE WORTHY OPPONENTS

. THOUGH TEMPTED TO STRIKE EARLIER BECAUSE OF THE SWIFTLY RISING COST

OF LIVING, THE MINERS HELD OFF UNTIL FRANCE'S COAL STOCKS HAD BEEN USED

UP BY THE BITTER COLD OF THE PAST MONTHS . WHEN THE STRIKE WAS ONLY A

FEW DAYS OLD, FACTORIES BEGAN TO SHUT DOWN FROM LACK OF FUEL . SUPPORT

FOR THE MINERS CAME FROM ALL SIDES . ROMAN CATHOLIC BISHOP GERARD

HUYGHE OF ARRAS PUBLICLY STATED THAT THEIR CONDITIONS MUST BE IMPROVED

. IN PARIS, 3,000 UNIVERSITY STUDENTS DEMONSTRATED FOR THE STRIKERS,

SHOUTING " DE GAULLE TO THE MINES ! " THE WINE DEALERS ASSOCIATION

PROMISED TO SEND 2,600 GALLONS OF RED WINE TO THE BEER-DRINKING MINERS

. OTHER UNIONS PULLED SHORT SYMPATHY STRIKES : RAILROAD WORKERS QUIT

FOR 15 MINUTES ; GAS AND ELECTRIC WORKERS WALKED OUT FOR TWO HOURS,

STALLING SUBWAYS, STOPPING WORK IN FACTORIES, TRAPPING SOME UNWARY

CITIZENS IN ELEVATORS BETWEEN FLOORS . DE GAULLE'S REQUISITION ORDER

ISELF WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR MUCH OF THE SYMPATHY FOR THE MINERS . UNDER

LAST WEEK'S DECREE, FAILURE TO RETURN TO WORK CAN BE PUNISHED BY

DISMISSAL, FINES AND, UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, JAIL TERMS . A COAL

CUTTER IN LENS SAID : " WE WERE STRIKING FOR MONEY AND SHORTER HOURS,

BUT NOW WE'RE STRIKING FOR THE RIGHT TO STRIKE . " AT WEEK'S END

PREMIER GEORGES POMPIDOU TOOK HIS CASE TO THE PEOPLE IN A NATIONWIDE

TELEVISION BROADCAST, URGING THE MINERS TO RETURN TO WORK TO PROTECT "

THE LIFE AND PROSPERITY OF THE NATION . " HE WAS STILL STANDING FIRM ON

MONEY : " THE REASONABLE RHYTHM OF SALARY INCREASES PROHIBITS GIVING

THE MINERS WHAT THEY ASK . " ALL THE GOVERNMENT WOULD PROMISE WAS A 5.7

PER CENT BOOST SPREAD OVER TEN MONTHS .

POSITION AS SENEGAL'S STRONGMAN . WHILE PRO-SENGHOR DEMONSTRATORS

CHANTED, " A SINGLE HAT ON A SINGLE HEAD, " MORE THAN 1,000,000

SENEGALESE, SHUFFLED TO THE POLLS AND HANDED SENGHOR A 99.5 PER CENT

OUI ON A NEW SENGHOR-TAILORED CONSTITUTION . TRUE TO THE SLOGAN, THE

NEW CHARTER SCRAPS SENEGAL'S TWO-MAN, PRESIDENT-PREMIER SYSTEM IN FAVOR

OF A SINGLE, STRONG PRESIDENCY FOR SENGHOR . THE VICTORY WAS RESOUNDING

PROOF OF SENGHOR'S SUPPORT AMONG SENEGAL'S MASSES, AND IT IS MADE ALL

THE MORE IMPRESSIVE BY THE FACT THAT HE IS A ROMAN CATHOLIC IN A 70 PER

CENT MOSLEM LAND . BUT THE OUTCOME WAS ALSO, IN A SENSE, A PAINFUL

DEFEAT FOR BLACK AFRICA'S MOST DISTINGUISHED INTELLECTUAL . FOR IT HAD

BEEN THE BESPECTACLED SENGHOR WHO ORIGINALLY INSTALLED SENEGAL'S

TWO-HEADED SYSTEM OF DIVIDED POWERS AFTER LEADING THE COUNTRY INTO

INDEPENDENCE 2F YEARS AGO . UNTIL HE AND DIA FELL OUT, FRENCH-ORIENTED

SENGHOR LOFTILY RIDICULED OTHER FRENCH AFRICAN NATIONS THAT HAD CHOSEN

ONE-MAN RULE . NOW, WHATEVER HIS CONTINUING POPULARITY AT HOME, SENGHOR

HAS PROBABLY LOST SOME OF HIS EFFECTIVENESS AS THE LEADING SPOKESMAN

FOR POLITICAL LIBERALISM IN FORMER FRENCH AFRICA . THE BRILLIANT

SENGHOR'S INTELLECTUAL CREDENTIALS ARE IMPRESSIVE INDEED . HIS

MUCHDISCUSSED POETIC WORKS INCLUDE CHANTS D'OMBRE, ETHIOPIQUES AND

NOCTURNES . WITH MARTINIQUE'S POET AIME CESAIRE, SENGHOR FOUNDED THE

MYSTIC PHILOSOPHY OF " NEGRITUDE . " SENGHOR WAS THE FIRST AFRICAN EVER

TO WIN FRANCE'S COVETED AGREGATION DE GRAMMAIRE ACADEMIC DEGREE, AND HE

SERVED WITH DISTINCTION AS A TERRITORIAL MEMBER OF THE POSTWAR FRENCH

NATIONAL ASSEMBLY . BY ALL ACCOUNTS, HE HAS BEEN BROODING OVER THE

POLITICAL CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH FORCED HIM TO END HIS 17-YEAR FRIENDSHIP

WITH DIA AND TAKE OVER AS STRONGMAN . BUT SENGHOR WAS NOT LIKELY TO LET

HIS SENSE OF GUILT GET HIM DOWN . HE IS, AFTER ALL, A STRONG ADMIRER OF

CHARLES DE GAULLE, AND MODELED HIS NEW CONSTITUTION PARTLY ON DE

GAULLE'S DESIGN FOR THE FIFTH REPUBLIC IN PARIS . PERHAPS WITH HIS

MENTOR IN MIND, SENGHOR CONCEDED IN ONE OF HIS POEMS THAT " ABSOLUTE

POWER REQUIRES THE BLOOD OF THE MOST DEAR BEING . " IN ANY CASE, BY

WEEK'S END HE HAD GRANDLY CHRISTENED SENEGAL'S NEW REGIME, " LA

DEUXIEME REPUBLIQUE .

QUESTION POSED BY THE SOBER NEW STATESMAN . THE ANSWERS VARY, BUT ONE

THING IS CLEAR : BRITAIN IS BEING BOMBARDED WITH A BARRAGE OF

FRANKNESS ABOUT SEX AND FLOODED WITH A PUBLIC QUESTIONING OF THE

LONG-ESTABLISHED VICTORIAN MORAL STANDARDS . WROTE THE ARCHBISHOP OF

CANTERBURY, IN A RECENT SUNDAY TIMES ARTICLE, " TODAY THERE IS IN OUR

SEX, BRIGHTER AND BETTER SEX . " AND THE CANDOR WITH WHICH THE

ONCE FORBIDDEN SUBJECT IS BEING EXPLORED IS POSITIVELY

ASTONISHING . IT IS THE DECOROUS BRITISH BROADCASTING CORP . THAT LEADS

THE DISCUSSION THESE DAYS . BBC PROGRAMS HAVE INCLUDED A LECTURE ON THE

ARGUMENTS FOR PREMARITAL INTERCOURSE, A DISCUSSION OF HOMOSEXUALITY

(KNOWN ON THE CONTINENT AS LE VICE ANGLAIS), A DRAMA ABOUT AN

ABORTIONIST, AND ANOTHER PLAY ABOUT MEN REMINISCING ABOUT THEIR PAST

SEX LIFE ( " HER BREASTS COULD FILL CHAMPAGNE GLASSES " ) . ON THE

POPULAR SATIRICAL SHOW THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS, THE YOUNG

ESTABLISHMENT TYPES POKE A KIND OF SEXUAL FUN THAT WOULD MAKE AMERICA'S

FCC BOSS NEWTON MINOW TURN PALE . TAKING OFF ON A GOVERNMENT REPORT

THAT ONE BABY IN EVERY EIGHT BORN IN LONDON IS ILLEGITIMATE,

BRASSY SINGER MILLICENT MARTIN LAMENTED AS SHE ROCKED A CRADLE : DON'T

YOU WEEP, MY LITTLE BABY CAUSE YOU HAVEN'T GOT A DAD . GO TO SLEEP, MY

LITTLE BABY, THINGS AREN'T REALLY QUITE SO BAD . THERE'S NO REASON ANY

LONGER WHY YOU OUGHT TO FEEL SO BLUE . THE WORLD IS FULL OF BASTARDS

JUST LIKE YOU . A DEBRIS OF CONVICTIONS . FACT IS, BOTH ON AND OFF THE

AIR WAVES, THE BRITISH ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED WITH THEIR SEARCH FOR WHAT

SOME CALL " A NEW MORALITY " TO FIT THE HUSHED-UP FACTS OF LIFE . " THE

POPULAR MORALITY IS NOW A WASTELAND, " SAID DR . GEORGE MORRISON

CARSTAIRS, 46, PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE AT EDINBURGH

UNIVERSITY, IN A RECENT BBC LECTURE . " IT IS LITTERED WITH THE DEBRIS

OF BROKEN CONVICTIONS . A NEW CONCEPT IS EMERGING, OF SEXUAL

RELATIONSHIPS AS A SOURCE OF PLEASURE, BUT ALSO AS A MUTUAL

ENCOUNTERING OF PERSONALITIES IN WHICH EACH EXPLORES THE OTHER AND AT

THE SAME TIME DISCOVERS NEW DEPTHS IN HIMSELF OR HERSELF . " IN A

VIOLENTLY CONTROVERSIAL REPORT, A GROUP OF THE RELIGIOUS SOCIETY OF

FRIENDS ATTACKED THE ONUS ATTACHED TO " A GREAT INCREASE IN ADOLESCENT

SEXUAL INTIMACY " AND PREMARITAL AFFAIRS . " IT IS FAIRLY COMMON IN

BOTH YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WITH HIGH STANDARDS OF CONDUCT AND INTEGRITY

TO HAVE ONE OR TWO LOVE AFFAIRS, INVOLVING INTERCOURSE, BEFORE THEY

FIND THE PERSON THEY WILL ULTIMATELY MARRY, " SAID THE REPORT . THIS,

CONCLUDED THE QUAKER REPORT, IS NOT SUCH A SIN . " WHERE THERE IS

GENUINE TENDERNESS, AN OPENNESS TO RESPONSIBILITY AND THE SEED OF

COMMITMENT, GOD IS SURELY NOT SHUT OUT . " A BLESSING . ALL THE HUBBUB

OVER SEX HAS, TO BE SURE, CAUSED A LOT OF MISGIVINGS, AND FEW CHURCHMEN

SHARE THE QUAKERS' LIBERAL VIEW . BUT MOST EXPERTS AGREE WITH WRITER V

REVOLUTION HAS BEEN ONE OF THE FEW BLESSINGS IN THE LIFE OF THIS

CENTURY . " THEY ATTRIBUTE THE NEW SEXUAL TOLERANCE AND THE LESSENING

OF VICTORIAN SHAME TO A WIDE VARIETY OF COMBINED CAUSES : THE HEAVY

IMPACT OF BOTH WORLD WARS ON THE OLD MORALITY, THE EMANCIPATION OF

WOMEN FROM THE HEARTH, A GRADUAL INCREASE IN COEDUCATIONAL SCHOOLING,

AND EVEN THE FACT THAT MORE BRITONS TRAVEL ABROAD FOR HOLIDAYS . BUT

EXACTLY WHERE THE PRESENT ORGY OF INTROSPECTION WILL LEAD NOT EVEN THE

BECOME ALL TOO CLEAR THAT THE RECENT FLOOD OF ARTISTIC EXPRESSION

POETRY READINGS BEFORE MASS AUDIENCES, EXHIBITS OF MODERN PAINTINGS,

JAZZ IMPORTED FROM ABROAD, BOOKS AND ARTICLES ABOUT THE STALIN TERROR

WERE BECOMING DANGEROUS CARRIERS OF ALIEN WESTERN IDEAS, SHAKING THE

FOUNDATIONS OF COMMUNITY SOCIETY . DESTALINIZATION, TOUCHED OFF BY

NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV HIMSELF AT THE 20TH PARTY CONGRESS IN 1956, HAD GONE

TOO FAR . NIKITA SPARED NO GROUP IN THE RESTLESS AUDIENCE . WRITER ILYA

EHRENBURG, 72, DREW SCORN FOR THE TITLE OF HIS 1954 NOVE, THE THAW,

WHICH, SAID NIKITA, SUGGESTS POLITICAL " IMPERMANENCE AND INSTABILITY .

/ AS FOR EHRENBURG'S MEMOIRS, WHICH HAVE BEEN RUNNING IN THE LITERARY

JOURNAL NOVY MIR, KHRUSHCHEV REMARKED CAUSTICALLY, " ONE NOTICES THAT

HE DEPICTS EVERYTHING IN GRIM TONES . " KHRUSHCHEV WARNED THE VETERAN

EHRENBURG AGAINST " SLIPPING INTO AN ANTI-COMMUNIST POSITION . " THEN

KHRUSHCHEV TURNED ON YOUNG POET EVGENCY EVTUSHENKO : " HE SHOWS

VACILLATIONS, INSTABILITY OF VIEWS . . . I WOULD LIKE TO ADVISE COMRADE

EVTUSHENKO AND OTHER MEN OF LETTERS THAT THEY SHOULD NOT SEEK CHEAP

SENSATIONALISM . " EVERYONE WAS AWARE, NIKITA ANNOUNCED, THAT

EVTUSHENKO RECENTLY TOLD A PARIS AUDIENCE THAT HIS POEM, BABI YAR

(WHICH DREW FIRE FROM THE KREMLIN), HAD BEEN " CRITICIZED BY DOGMATISTS

. " SUCH BEHIND-THE-BACK REMARKS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES WILL NOT DO,

HINTED THE PREMIER : " IF THE ENEMIES OF OUR CAUSE BEGIN TO PRAISE YOU

FOR WORKS CONVENIENT TO THEIR PURPOSE, THEN THE PEOPLE WILL JUSTLY

CRITICIZE YOU . SO CHOOSE WHAT SUITS YOU BEST . " LOVE FOR TREES .

KHRUSHCHEV DESCRIBED WITH HORROR A RECENT JAZZ CONCERT HE ATTENDED ( "

ONE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HIDE, BUT THERE WAS NO PLACE TO HIDE " ),

EXPRESSED DEEP DISTASTE AT SUCH NEW DANCE CRAZES AS THE TWIST ( "

SIMPLY OBSCENITIES, SOME SORT OF FRENZY, THE DEVIL KNOWS WHAT " ), AND

TURNED ON THE PAINTERS AND SCULPTORS WITH UNDISGUISED FURY . SOME, HE

ROARED, SEEK INSPIRATION IN " RUBBISH HEAPS AND STINKING LATRINES, " OR

/ PRESENT PEOPLE IN AN INTENTIONALLY UGLY ASPECT . " SUCH A MAN WAS

ERNEST NEIZVESTNY, A SCULPTOR WHO HAS RECENTLY WON WIDE ACCLAIM IN

MOSCOW'S ART WORLD WITH HIS PROVOCATIVE WORKS . BUT TO KHRUSHCHEV, HIS

WORK WAS JUST A " NAUSEATING CONCOCTION . IT IS A GOOD THING WE DO NOT

HAVE MANY SUCH ARTISTS, " HE SAID . JUST WHAT WERE NIKITA'S TASTES ?

FOR A MOMENT, HIS IMAGINATION TOOK FLIGHT, AS THE AUDIENCE LISTENED

NERVOUSLY : " RECENTLY I WAS WATCHING THE SUN RISE ON A FOREST COVERED

IN HOARFROST . I SAID TO THOSE WITH ME : " LOOK AT THOSE FIR TREES, AT

THEIR ATTIRE, AT THOSE SNOWFLAKES GLISTENING IN THE RAYS OF THE SUN .

HOW WONDERFULLY BEAUTIFUL THAT IS ! ' YET THE MODERNISTS AND

ABSTRACTIONISTS WANT TO PAINT THESE FIR TREES WITH THEIR ROOTS IN THE

AIR, AND THEY SAID THIS IS NEW, PROGRESSIVE ART . " TIME TO SHUT UP .

RUNNING THROUGH HIS SPEECH WAS THE CLEAR SUGGESTION THAT KHRUSHCHEV

FELT HIS OWN ROOTS WERE IN DANGER . TOO MANY OF THE INTELLECTUALS WERE

DEVOTING THEIR WORK TO EXPOSURE OF THE EXCESSES OF TERROR IN THE STALIN

ERA WHICH WAS STRIKING PRETTY CLOSE TO HOME, SINCE KHRUSHCHEV HAD BEEN

STALIN'S HENCHMAN THROUGHOUT THAT PERIOD . " THE QUESTION IS SOMETIMES

ASKED, " NIKITA ADMITTED, " DID THE LEADING PEOPLE OF THE PARTY KNOW

ABOUT THE ARRESTS AT THE TIME ? YES, THEY KNEW . BUT DID THEY KNOW

THAT COMPLETELY INNOCENT PEOPLE WERE BEING ARRESTED .? NO, THEY DID

NOT KNOW . " ANYONE FAMILIAR WITH NIKITA'S 1956 DESTALINIZATION SPEECH

TO THE 20TH PARTY CONGRESS KNEW THIS TO BE A LIE, FOR HE HAD OPENLY

DISCUSSED STALIN'S MURDEROUS POLITICAL PURGES OF THE 1930S . NOW, HE

SAID, WAS THE TIME TO SHUT UP ABOUT THE DARK CHAPTERS OF HISTORY . "

ALL ATTENTION IS BEING ONE-SIDEDLY CONCENTRATED ON LAWLESSNESS AND THE

ABUSE

OF POWER . HERE ONE NEEDS MODERATION . IF ALL WRITERS BEGAN TO WRITE

ONLY ON THIS TOPIC, WHAT SORT OF LITERATURE WOULD THERE BE .? WHO

WOULD DASH FOR IT ? FLIES, ENORMOUS FAT FLIES . EVERY SORT OF

BOURGEOIS SCUM FROM ABROAD WILL CRAWL TOWARD IT . " WHEN KHRUSHCHEV'S

SPEECH WAS OVER, THE STUNNED AUDIENCE LEFT THE HALL WEARING THE OLD,

FAMILIAR STONY STARES OF STALIN'S DAY . IT WOULD BE HARD TO FORCE THEM

ALL INTO PUBLIC RECANTATIONS ; IN FACT, A SURPRISING NUMBER STAYED

SILENT . BUT SURE ENOUGH, SOME CAVED IN QUICKLY TO THE CULTURAL PURGE .

WITHIN 48 HOURS, THE MOSCOW WRITERS UNION HAD OUSTED ITS LIBERAL

CHAIRMAN, POET STEPAN SHCHIPACHOV, AND REPLACED HIM WITH A REGIME

TRUSTY . AND AS FOR HAPLESS ERNEST NEIZVESTNY, THE SCULPTOR DENOUNCED

PERSONALLY BY NIKITA, HE SOON SHOWED UP IN PRAVDA WITH AN OBEDIENT

GOVERNMENT'S COUNCIL OF MINISTERS, WHICH ANNOUNCED CREATION OF A NEW,

OF HIS MUCH-TOUTED SEVEN-YEAR PLAN (1964-65) AND ORDERED THE NEW

ECONOMIC CZARS TO GET BUSY AND DRAFT A NEW SET OF QUOTAS . THE BOUNCY

PREMIER ALSO TURNED UP AT A MOSCOW MEETING OF AGRICULTURAL EXPERTS AND

EXPLAINED WHY HE FIRED THE SOVIET AGRICULTURE MINISTER FORNIGHT AGO

(TIME, MARCH 15) . HE SPENT TOO MUCH TIME WRITING DIRECTIVES FROM

MOSCOW AND TOO LITTLE TIME ON THE ROAD, INSPECTING THE FARMS HE WAS

ORDERING ABOUT . " THE COWS CAN'T READ DIRECTIVES, " SCOLDED NIKITA . "

AND NATURAL GAS WORKERS WENT OUT ON A SYMPATHY STRIKE, AND A 24-HOUR

CONTINUED INTRANSIGENCE OF THE STRIKERS, DE GAULLE KNEW HE MIGHT HAVE

TO GIVE IN. AT A CABINET MEETING IN PARIS, HE ORDERED STUDIES DRAWN UP

COMPARING WAGES IN PRIVATE AND GOVERNMENT-OWNED INDUSTRY, WITH AN EYE

TOWARD MAKING ADJUSTMENTS . BUT HE WAS STILL RANKLED AT THE MONETARY

SUPPORT GIVEN THE STRIKERS BY THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH IN THE NORTHERN

COAL AREAS . ASKED WHERE THE FUNDS WOULD COME FROM TO PAY FOR ANY WAGE

HIKE, HE SUGGESTED WE COULD ALWAYS TAKE UP A COLLECTION IN THE CHURCHES

GROCERIES . SUDDENLY, A NEWS BULLETIN FROM NEIGHBORING KENYA BLARED

FROM A RADIO IN A BAR NEXT DOOR . AN INSTANT LATER, THE GUTTURAL

TWITTER THAT IS THE SOMALI TONGUE BECAME AN OMINOUS MUTTERING, AND THE

CROWD OF 500 WAS ON THE RAMPAGE . STONING CARS, THE SOMALIS MARCHED TO

THE BRITISH EMBASSY, TOUCHING OFF THREE DAYS OF SHOUTING,

WINDOW-SMASHING RIOTS . MATTER OF HERITAGE . WHAT SET OFF THE EXPLOSION

WAS ANNOUNCEMENT BY BRITISH COLONIAL SECRETARY DUNCAN SANDYS THAT A

SLICE OF SCRUB AND SAND WHICH BORDERS ON SOMALIA WOULD BE MADE ONE OF

SEVEN PROVINCES OF KENYA, WHICH IS DUE TO GET INDEPENDENCE NEXT YEAR

(TIME, MARCH 15) . AS IT HAPPENS, KENYA'S NORTHEAST HAS LONG BEEN A

FAVORITE SQUATTING GROUND FOR NOMADIC SOMALI TRIBESMEN, WHO HERD THEIR

CAMELS AND GOATS BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE HORN OF AFRICA WITHOUT HEED

TO NATIONAL BORDERS . FIERCELY INDEPENDENT, THE ILLITERATE MOSLEM

TRIBESMEN FIGHT SAVAGELY AMONG THEMSELVES FOR GRAZING LAND, FOR THIS IS

THE POSSESSION THEY HOLD MOST DEAR . A PROUD PEOPLE, TALL, LITHE AND

FINE-FEATURED, THE SOMALIS ARE HAMITIC IN ORIGIN, DESCENDED IN PART

FROM 7TH CENTURY ARABS WHO CROSSED INTO AFRICA FROM YEMEN . FOREVER

VAIN ABOUT THEIR HERITAGE, THEY ARE ALSO ACCUSTOMED TO HAVING THEIR OWN

WAY . THE SOMALIS BEGAN RUNNING INTO THE STUBBORN OBJECTIONS OF OTHERS

SHORTLY AFTER SOMALIA (POP . 2,000,000) WON INDEPENDENCE IN 1960 AND

BEGAN BUILDING A NATION OUT OF FORMER ITALIAN SOMALIA AND BRITISH

SOMALILAND . EMPEROR HAILE SELASSIE COLDLY SAID NO TO SOMALIA'S

INSISTENCE ON ANNEXATION OF AN ETHIOPIAN BORDER AREA CONTAINING

1,000,000 SOMALIS . FRANCE LIKEWISE REFUSED TO GIVE UP FRENCH

SOMALILAND, WHERE 600,000 SOMALIS LIVE . AND THOUGH THE BLEAK, BARREN

SLICE OF TERRITORY INSIDE KENYA HARBORS 200,000 SOMALIS, KENYA'S BLACK

NATIONALIST LEADERS, LED BY EX-MAU MAU CHIEFTAIN JOMO ( " BURNING SPEAR

/ ) KENYATTA, HAVE ALWAYS VOWED THAT LOSS OF THEIR NORTHEAST CORNER

WOULD MEAN WAR WITH THEIR OWN BLACK RENDILLES, WHO COVER THEMSELVES

WITH FEATHERS ; WITH THEIR TURKANAS, WHO WEAR LITTLE EXCEPT MUD HATS

; AND WITH THE MARILLES, WHO WEAR ONLY RIFLES . THUS, BRITAIN'S SANDYS

WAS BOUND TO MAKE ENEMIES AND TO RISK VIOLENCE NO MATTER WHAT HIS

DECISION ABOUT KENYA'S FRONTIER . SPEARING THE COMMISSIONER . NO SOMALI

SAW IT THAT WAY . MOBS SURGING THROUGH MOGADISHU'S HEAT (100O PLUS) HAD

TO BE BROKEN UP BY MOUNTED POLICE SWINGING LONG BATONS ; BEFORE THE

DISTURBANCE WAS QUELLED, SOME 500 PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED . IN HARGEISA,

THE ONETIME CAPITAL OF BRITISH SOMALILAND, CROWDS STONED BRITISH HOMES

AND CARS, ATTACKED THE BRITISH CONSULATE . PRESUMABLY BECAUSE OF

BRITAIN'S CLOSE TIES TO THE U.S., NEWLY ARRIVED U.S . AMBASSADOR HORACE

TORBERT WAS STONED OUT OF THE TOWN OF GALCAIO, HIS LAND-ROVER NARROWLY

OUTDISTANCING A MOB OF 1,000 MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN . IN KENYA ITSELF,

A SOMALI TRIBESMAN SPEARED A DISTRICT COMMISSIONER, LIEUT . COLONEL

JOHN BALFOUR, AND ONE MOB HAULED DOWN THE UNION JACK . RESTORING

INTERNAL ORDER WITH TROOPS, SOMALIA'S PREMIER ABDIRASHID ALI SHERMARKE

CALLED THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY INTO SESSION, DEMANDED THAT " RELATIONS

WITH BRITAIN BE REVISED . " AS THE DEBATE DRONED ON, THE BRITISH HOPED

THAT PASSIONS MIGHT COOL . BUT AT WEEK'S END THE OUTRAGED DEPUTIES

VOTED 74 TO 14 TO BREAK OFF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH LONDON, THOUGH IT

SEEMED CLEAR THAT CONSULAR TIES WOULD BE RETAINED ; SUCH A COMPROMISE

APPEARED APPROPRIATE IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE BRITISH WERE TO

SUPPLY SOMALIA WITH $3,600,000 IN AID THIS YEAR . WITH A SIGH AND A

SHRUG, BRITAIN'S MOGADISHU EMBASSY BEGAN PACKING UP, AND IN LONDON THE

BRITISH GOVERNMENT SUGGESTED THAT IT " WILL AT AN APPROPRIATE TIME "

RECONSIDER THE WHOLE

NORTHEAST KENYA QUESTION .

ISRAEL JEW AGAINST JEW IN THE FOUR-MONTH TRIAL OF ADOLF EICHMANN,

ONE DARK CHAPTER OF THE NAZI HOLOCAUST WAS NEVER FULLY BROUGHT OUT :

THE RULE OF NAZI-ORGANIZED COUNCILS OF JEWISH ELDERS IN EUROPEAN

GHETTOS . BACKED BY THEIR OWN HIGH-BOOTED JEWISH POLICE, THE COUNCILS

COMPILED DEATH LISTS OF JEWS AND ROUNDED UP THEIR OWN PEOPLE FOR

DEPORTATION TO NAZI EXTERMINATION CAMPS . REFUSAL TO HELP EICHMANN'S "

TRANSPORTATION " EXPERTS WOULD HAVE MEANT IMMEDIATE DEATH, BUT ALWAYS

THERE WAS THE AGONIZING MORAL DILEMMA : EVEN UNDER DURESS, WAS

COOPERATION NOT BETRAYAL ? LAST WEEK ISRAELI PROSECUTOR DAVID LIBAI

GAVE THE STATE'S ANSWER IN THE FIRST TRIAL OF A JEWISH POLICEMAN WHO

SERVED THE NAZIS . ITS ANSWER WAS YES . IN THE DOCK OF A TINY, DRAB TEL

AVIV COURTROOM, HEAD BURIED IN HIS HANDS, SAT THE ASSISTANT CONDUCTOR

OF THE ISRAEL NATIONAL OPERA, HIRSCH BARENBLAT, 48, FORMER COMMANDER OF

THE JEWISH POLICE IN BEDZIN, POLAND . FOR TWO YEARS AFTER HE MANAGED TO

GET TO ISRAEL IN 1958, BARENBLAT ATTRACTED NO PARTICULAR ATTENTION .

THEN, DURING INTRODUCTIONS AT A CONCERT IN A KIBBUTZ, A MEMBER OF THE

AUDIENCE SUDDENLY LEAPED UP AND SHOUTED : " BARENBLAT, I REMEMBER YOU

! YOU MURDERED JEWS ! " THE CONCERT BROKE UP AMIDST ANGRY CONFUSION

. IN 1961, AFTER A POLICE INVESTIGATION, BARENBLAT WAS ARRESTED AND

CHARGED UNDER THE ISRAELI LAW PUNISHING NAZIS AND THEIR COLLABORATORS

WHO WERE MEMBERS OF " HOSTILE ORGANIZATIONS " THE SAME LAW UNDER WHICH

EICHMANN WAS TRIED AS A GESTAPO MEMBER, AND WHICH THE GOVERNMENT NOW

WANTS EXTENDED TO INCLUDE THE JEWISH POLICE . IN BARENBLAT'S CASE, THE

MAXIMUM PENALTY WOULD BE SEVEN TO TEN YEARS IN PRISON ON EACH OF TWELVE

SPECIFIC ACCUSATIONS OF PERSECUTION . ON THE OPENING DAY OF WHAT LOOKED

TO BE A DRAWN-OUT TRIAL, A TEL AVIV CARPENTER TEARFULLY RECALLED THAT

BARENBLAT'S JEWISH POLICE ONCE TROOPED BACK FROM A ROUND-UP IN BEDZIN "

LOUDLY SINGING, AS IF FROM A VICTORIOUS ENGAGEMENT, " DESCRIBED HOW

THEY HERDED JEWISH MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN INTO TRUCKS HEADED FOR

AUSCHWITZ . " EVEN THE STREETS WEPT, " THE WITNESS SAID . PROSECUTOR

LIBAI CONCEDED THAT BARENBLAT SAVED " MAYBE TEN OR 20 JEWS, " BUT ADDED

: " THIS COURT WILL HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO SAVE HIS OWN SOUL HE WAS

ENTITLED TO CARRY OUT THE TASKS OF THE JEWISH POLICE . " DEFENSE

ATTORNEY ARIEH ROSENBLUM, SUPPORTING BARENBLAT'S PLEA OF INNOCENCE,

SAID THAT HIS CONDUCT WAS JUSTIFIABLE, AND ARGUED THAT HE WAS ACQUITTED

OF COLLABORATIONIST CHARGES AFTER THE WAR BY A POLISH COURT . " THE

JEWISH POLICE, " ROSENBLUM SAID, " CANNOT BE REGARDED AS HOSTILE TO THE

JEWISH PEOPLE . THEIR INTENTION WAS NOT HOSTILITY . THEY DID NOT SEEK

TO EXTERMINATE JEWS ; THEY SERVED WHAT THEY DEEMED THE BEST INTERESTS

OF THE JEWISH COMMUNITY UNDER THE WORST POSSIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES . "

IRAN WATER & BLOOD ON A PLATFORM JUTTING FROM A SHEER,

1,500-FT . GORGE IN THE ZAGROS MOUNTAINS, THE SHAH OF IRAN PICKED UP A

CEREMONIAL TELEPHONE AND SPOKE AN ORDER . SECONDS LATER, TONS OF WATER

FROM THE AB-I-DIZ RIVER BELOW CRASHED THROUGH SLUICE GATES AND BEGAN

TURNING GIANT DYNAMOS . A KNOT OF CABINET MINISTERS, DIPLOMATS AND

ENGINEERS BURST INTO HAT-WAVING CHEERS AS, DOWN IN THE CANYON,

ELECTRICITY BEGAN FLOWING INTO MOSLEM VILLAGES THAT HAD NEVER BEFORE

KNOWN THE MAGIC OF PLUG-IN POWER . THUS LAST WEEK IRAN'S HUGE, $67.2

MILLION " MOHAMMED REZA SHAH PAHLEVI DAM, " HIGHEST IN THE MIDDLE

EAST, WENT INTO OPERATION AS ANOTHER FEATHER IN THE CROWN OF THE

COUNTRY'S 43-YEAR-OLD REFORM-MINDED MONARCH . TO HELP FINANCE THE DAM,

THE WORLD BANK LOANED IRAN $42 MILLION, BUT THE REST OF THE CASH CAME

FROM THE SHAH'S $300 MILLION ANNUAL OIL REVENUES . TO OVERSEE THE

PROJECT, IRAN PICKED TWO EX-CHAIRMEN OF THE U.S.'S TENNESSEE VALLEY

AUTHORITY, DAVID E . LILIENTHAL AND GORDON R . CLAPP, WHO NOW HEAD A

MANHATTAN-BASED CONSULTING FIRM . LAST WEEK'S INAUGURATION WAS RIGHT ON

SCHEDULE, JUST ONE YEAR AND FIVE MONTHS AFTER THE FIRST CONCRETE WAS

POURED . THE DAM'S PRINCIPAL PURPOSE IS TO BRING FERTILITY BACK TO

DESOLATE KHUZISTAN PROVINCE, AN AREA THE SIZE OF MICHIGAN IN SOUTHWEST

IRAN, NEAR THE PERSIAN GULF . TWENTY-FIVE CENTURIES AGO, KHUZISTAN WAS

THE FABLED FERTILE GRANARY OF THE ANCIENT PERSIAN EMPIRE . BUT THE

REGION HAS SINCE ERODED INTO A VIRTUAL WASTELAND ; THE LAST MAJOR

RECLAMATION ATTEMPT WAS A SYSTEM OF IRRIGATION CANALS DUG BY KING

SHAPUR II IN 300 A.D . THE NEW DAM WILL WATER 360,000 ACRES, AND

PROVIDE ELECTRICITY EVEN FOR THE PROVINCES REMOTEST VILLAGES AND FIVE

CITIES, INCLUDING THE OIL-REFINING CENTER OF ABADAN, OPENING THE WAY

FOR INDUSTRIALIZATION . IN THE LONG RUN, IRAN HOPES TO BUILD 13 MORE

DAMS TO IRRIGATE MUCH OF THE SEMI-ARID LAND CURRENTLY BEING HANDED OUT

TO PEASANTS UNDER THE SHAH'S BIG AGRARIAN REFORM PROGRAM, WHICH WAS

APPROVED 1,000TO-1 IN A NATIONAL REFERENDUM IN JANUARY . WITH THE

NATION BEHIND HIM, THE SHAH HAS PUSHED STEADILY AHEAD WITH HIS LAND

SPLIT-UP, DESPITE LOUD OUTCRIES FROM THE BIG LANDOWNERS . A FEW WEEKS

AGO, ONE OUTRAGED GROUP, THE NOMADIC QASHQAI (PRONOUNCED GOSH GUY)

TRIBESMEN, WHO HERD CATTLE IN THE SOUTHERN PROVINCE OF FARS, REGISTERED

ITS PROTEST BY ATTACKING IRANIAN POLICE POSTS, KILLING TEN OFFICERS AND

MEN . WHEN THE DISSIDENT QASHQAI REFUSED TO SURRENDER AND WERE JOINED

BY MALCONTENTS OF TWO OTHER TRIBES, THE SHAH GRIMLY ORDERED HIS AIR

FORCE TO CRUSH THE REVOLT . PEELING OUT OF THE SUN, HIS U.S.MADE F-86

JETS LAST WEEK FLASHED DOWN ON THE REBELS WITH BOMBING AND STRAFING

RUNS THAT LEFT AN ESTIMATED 150 TRIBESMEN SPRAWLED DEAD IN THE PLAINS .

RISING 647 FT., IT WILL TOP EGYPT'S STILL ABUILDING ASWAN HIGH DAM BY

MIDDLE EAST THE CAMEL DRIVER (SEE

COVER) AT 6 : 30 ONE MORNING EARLY THIS MONTH, A PHONE SHRILLED IN THE

SMALL OFFICE OFF THE BEDROOM OF EGYPT'S PRESIDENT GAMAL ABDEL NASSER .

ALREADY AWAKE, HE LIFTED THE RECEIVER TO HEAR EXCITING NEWS : A

MILITARY COUP HAD JUST BEEN LAUNCHED AGAINST THE ANTI-NASSER GOVERNMENT

OF SYRIA . THE PHONE RANG AGAIN . IT WAS THE MINISTER OF CULTURE AND

NATIONAL GUIDANCE . HOW SHOULD RADIO CAIRO HANDLE THE SYRIAN CRISIS ?

SUPPORT THE REBELS, SNAPPED NASSER . THEN EGYPT'S BOSS RAPPED OUT A

SUCCESSION OF TELEPHONED COMMANDS . TO THE AIR FORCE : ALERT THE

BOMBERS AND FIGHTERS IN CASE THE SYRIAN REBELS CALL FOR HELP . TO THE

NAVY (SIX DESTROYERS AND TEN SUBMARINES) : STEAM NORTHWARD AND AWAIT

ORDERS . TO THE ARMY : PREPARE TO MOVE IN CASE THE ISRAELIS MIGHT BE

THINKING OF INTERVENTION ; PLACE MISSILES ON LAUNCH PADS READY TO FIRE

. THIS DONE, NASSER FINISHED DRESSING AND WENT DOWNSTAIRS . THE PHONE

RANG AGAIN, LONG DISTANCE FROM BAGHDAD . PRESIDENT ABDUL SALAM AREF,

WHO ONLY FOUR WEEKS BEFORE HAD OVERTHROWN ANOTHER ANTI-NASSER REGIME IN

IRAQ, SOLICITOUSLY ASKED WHAT NASSER INTENDED DOING ABOUT SYRIA .

NASSER SAID THAT HE WOULD RECOGNIZE A REBEL GOVERNMENT AS SOON AS IT

WAS FORMED . AREF DELICATELY RESPONDED THAT OF COURSE, EGYPT SHOULD BE

THE FIRST STATE TO GRANT RECOGNITION, PROMISED THAT IRAQ WOULD FOLLOW

SUIT FIVE MINUTES LATER . LIMB FROM LIMB . SINCE THE SYRIAN COUP WAS

BOTH SWIFT AND SUCCESSFUL, NASSER'S NERVES AND THE EGYPTIAN ARMY WERE

NOT PUT TO THE TEST . ISRAEL ALERTED ITS BORDER DEFENSES BUT MADE NO

FURTHER MOVE . ON THE SURFACE, IN FACT, THE SYRIAN AFFAIR WAS MUCH

MILDER AND LESS BLOODY THAN MOST ARAB REVOLTS . IN THE PAST 15 YEARS,

THE MIDDLE EAST HAS BEEN CONTINUALLY SHAKEN LIKE A KALEIDOSCOPE,

CONSTANTLY FALLING INTO NEW PATTERNS . THERE HAVE BEEN TWO SIZABLE WARS

AND FULLY TWO DOZEN ARMED UPRISINGS AND REBELLIONS . PREMIERS AND

PRINCES HAVE BEEN TORN LIMB FROM LIMB BY STREET MOBS ; THOUSANDS OF

POLITICIANS AND ARMY OFFICERS HAVE BEEN KILLED BY HANGING, BEHEADING,

FIRING SQUADS AND ASSASSINS ; AND SWARMS OF STUDENTS, WORKERS AND

TRIBESMEN HAVE BEEN MOWED DOWN BY MACHINE GUNS AND BOMBS . IT WAS QUITE

CLEAR LAST WEEK THAT THE LATEST SHAKE OF THE KALEIDOSCOPE RESULTED IN

NEW PATTERNS AND ALIGNMENTS OVERWHELMINGLY FAVORABLE TO GAMAL ABDEL

NASSER . THE SYRIAN REVOLUTION WAS THE THIRD IN SIX MONTHS BY REBELS

PLEDGED TO MAKE COMMON CAUSE WITH EGYPT . FLIGHTS OF NEW LEADERS POURED

INTO CAIRO FOR TEARSTAINED EMBRACES WITH NASSER AND NIGHTLONG

CONFERENCES ON THE FUTURE COURSE OF THAT MISTY CONCEPT CALLED ARAB

UNITY . NASSER STANDS AT THE PINNACLE OF PRESTIGE, IF NOT OF POWER, AND

THE SHADOW HE CASTS HAS NEVER BEEN LONGER . TODAY, IT FALLS OVER THE

ENTIRE ARAB WORLD FROM THE PERSIAN GULF TO THE ATLANTIC OCEAN . MATTER

OF SABOTAGE ? FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 500 YEARS, THE THREE KEY ARAB

STATES OF EGYPT, IRAQ AND SYRIA HAVE A SIMILAR POLITICAL POSTURE AND

ARE ON CLOSE AND FRIENDLY TERMS . THE NEW CROWD IN PRIMITIVE YEMEN,

WHERE 28,000 EGYPTIAN TROOPS ARE PROPPING UP STILL ANOTHER PRONASSER

REBELLION, IS EAGER TO JOIN ANY ALLIANCE THAT CAN BE HAMMERED OUT . THE

MONARCHIES OF SAUDI ARABIA AND JORDAN CLOSE FRIENDS OF THE WEST BUT

HATED ENEMIES OF THE ARAB NATIONALISTS FACE THE THREAT OF UPRISINGS AT

THE HANDS OF POWERFUL LOCAL FRIENDS OF THE MAN IN CAIRO . WHEN KING

SAUD'S PRIVATE COMET PLANE, EQUIPPED WITH A ROYAL THRONE, CRASHED LAST

WEEK AGAINST AN ITALIAN MOUNTAIN, KILLING ALL 18 ABOARD, THE SAUDI

ARABS AUTOMATICALLY ASSUMED THAT IT HAD BEEN SABOTAGED BY NASSER AGENTS

MAYBE IT WAS AND MAYBE IT WAS NOT . IN THE

SWIRLING MIDDLE EAST STRUGGLE, CAIRO WOULD FLEX ITS MUSCLES WHERE IT

COULD . THE SUCCESSFUL COUPS IN YEMEN, SYRIA AND IRAQ WERE NO SURPRISE

TO GAMAL ABDEL NASSER . HE KNEW THEY WERE COMING, IF NOT PRECISELY WHEN

AND HOW . HE KNEW THE CONSPIRATORS INVOLVED IN EACH, THOUGH HE CLAIMS

TO HAVE PULLED NO STRINGS . CAIRO IS THICKLY POPULATED BY EXILES FROM

EVERY CORNER OF THE ARAB WORLD, RANGING FROM SYRIA'S TOUGH ABDUL HAMID

SERRAJ, WHO ORIGINALLY FAILED NASSER IN DAMASCUS, TO OBSCURE TUNISIANS,

YEMENIS, SAUDIS, JORDANIANS AND REFUGEES FROM THE BRITISHBACKED

SHEIKDOMS OF THE PERSIAN GULF . MANY OF THEM LIVE WELL ON EGYPTIAN

SUBSIDIES . FORMER SAUDI PETROLEUM MINISTER ABDULLAH TARIKI IS IN AND

OUT OF CAIRO FREQUENTLY, HELPING ORGANIZE ARMS SHIPMENTS TO SAUDI

ARABIAN DISSIDENTS BY AIR AND ACROSS THE LONG, EMPTY BORDER WITH KUWAIT

. NASSER HAS WON OVER SAUDI ARABIA'S AMBASSADOR TO WEST GERMANY, WHO

RESIGNED A FORTNIGHT AGO IN PROTEST AT HIS COUNTRY'S FAILURE TO

INSTITUTE REFORMS . AT LEAST SIX OTHER SAUDI AMBASSADORS ARE

SYMPATHETIC TO NASSER'S CAUSE ACCENTED VOICE . ALL THE ARAB WORLD IS

INFLUENCED BY NASSER'S GENIUS AS A PROPAGANDIST . RISING TO SHARE

CAIRO'S SKYLINE WITH THE HUGE DOME OF THE MOHAMMED ALI MOSQUE IS A

FOREST OF TRANSMITTING ANTENNAS THAT CARRY RADIO CAIRO'S MESSAGE TO ALL

THE WORLD . CAIRO'S VOICE BEARS MANY ACCENTS . THERE IS THE OVERT VOICE

OF THE ARABS, AND A WHOLE CONCATENATION OF " VOICES " (VOICE OF THE

ARAB NATION, FREE VOICE OF IRAN, VOICE OF FREE AFRICA, ETC.), WHICH

BLEAT INCITEMENT TO REBELLION WITH NO IDENTIFICATION OF THEIR EGYPTIAN

ORIGIN . THE TRANSMITTING COMPLEX IS ELABORATE AND DEVILISHLY CLEVER .

RECENTLY, SOMALI-LANGUAGE TRANSMISSIONS HAVE SUPPORTED THE CLAIMS OF

SOMALIA TO A PORTION OF NORTHEAST KENYA, WHILE SWAHILI BROADCASTS AIMED

AT KENYA DENOUNCE THE IDEA . A U.S . CONSTRUCTION FIRM IS BUILDING A

NEW TRANSMITTER, WHICH WILL BE BEAMED AT TUNISIA AND AIMED AT

DESTROYING PRESIDENT HABIB BOURGUIBA . EGYPTIAN TV, THE LIVELIEST IN

THE MIDDLE EAST, MANAGES TO KEEP THREE CHANNELS BUSY 20 HOURS A DAY,

WHILE KINESCOPES SUBTLY LOADED WITH NASSER PROPAGANDA ARE SHIPPED OUT

TO ALGERIA, KUWAIT AND LEBANON . NASSER HAS COLLECTED THE BEST

ENTERTAINERS IN THE ARAB WORLD, AND USES THEM SUPERBLY . WHEN UM

KALSOUM SINGS WE REVOLUTIONISTS, THE BEDOUINS IN THE DESERT ARE DEEPLY

STIRRED . ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR SONGS AMONG ARAB KIDS IS HOW WE BUILD

THE HIGH DAM AT ASWAN . EVERY TRANSISTOR RADIO IN THE MIDDLE EAST IS A

NASSER AGENT . WHEN YEMEN REVOLTED AGAINST THE IMAM, NASSER SENT THEM

ARMS AND TRANSISTORS . ARAB COMMUNISTS WHO BROADCAST LONG, WINDY

SPEECHES FROM BULGARIA HAVE NOT A CHANCE AGAINST NASSER'S ENTERTAINERS

. FIRE STRIKER . BUT NASSER'S TRIUMPHS ARE NOT SOLELY THE RESULT OF

SUBVERSION AND POP SINGERS . HIS VERY EXAMPLE IS AN INSPIRATION . HE

HAS BEEN THE UNCONTESTED RULER OF EGYPT FOR ALMOST A DECADE, EVER SINCE

FEBRUARY 1954, WHEN HE PUT DOWN A REVOLT OF CAVALRY OFFICERS AND

CONSOLIDATED HIS REGIME . DURING THAT TIME, THE OLD POLITICAL REMNANTS

SUCH AS THE WAFDISTS HAVE DISAPPEARED AND EVEN BEEN FORGOTTEN . IT IS

NASSER WHOSE PERSONALITY STANDS ABOVE ALL OTHERS IN EGYPT AND THE ARAB

WORLD, AND NO OTHER NAME STRIKES FIRE LIKE HIS . HE IS HAILED AS THE

MAN WHO DESTROYED EGYPT'S CORRUPT PAST AND GAVE ARABS A NEW DIGNITY .

HIS PICTURE, WITH ITS PEPSODENT SMILE, IS FOUND IN EVERY CORNER OF THE

MIDDLE EAST, FROM IRAQI BAZAARS TO THE HUTS OF ROYALIST YEMENI

TRIBESMEN WHO STILL CLING TO NASSER'S PICTURE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE

FIGHTING NASSER'S TROOPS .

WHAT NASSER HAS WORKING FOR HIM IS THE DEEP

DESIRE OF ALL ARABS TO BE UNITED IN A SINGLE ARAB NATION, AND THEIR

CONVICTION GRUDGING OR ENTHUSIASTIC THAT NASSER REPRESENTS THE BEST

HOPE OF ACHIEVING IT . THIS DREAM OF UNITY HARKS BACK TO THE GOLDEN AGE

OF THE 7TH CENTURY WHEN, SPURRED BY THE MESSIANIC MOSLEM RELIGION

HANDED DOWN BY MOHAMMED THE PROPHET, ARAB WARRIORS BURST FROM THEIR

DESERT PENINSULA AND CONQUERED EVERYTHING IN SIGHT . IN LESS THAN 150

YEARS, THE ARABS SWEPT VICTORIOUSLY NORTH TO ASIA MINOR AND THE WALLS

OF BYZANTINE CONSTANTINOPLE, SOUTH OVER PERSIA AND AFGHANISTAN TO THE

HEART OF INDIA, EAST THROUGH CENTRAL ASIA TO THE BORDERS OF CHINA, WEST

OVER EGYPT AND AFRICA TO SPAIN AND SOUTHERN FRANCE . IT WAS AN

INCREDIBLE EMPIRE LARGER THAN ANY CARVED OUT BY ALEXANDER THE GREAT OR

IMPERIAL ROME . IT WAS ALSO AN EMPIRE THAT FELL SWIFTLY APART . BY THE

16TH CENTURY, THE ARAB STATES, ONE BY ONE, FELL TO THE OTTOMANS AND

PASSED INTO THE LONG SLEEP OF TURKISH DOMINATION . THEN, IN WORLD WAR

I, ARAB NATIONALISTS REBELLED AGAINST THEIR TURKISH OVERLORDS AND

FOUGHT BESIDE THE BRITISH ARMIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST, CONFIDENT THAT

THEY WOULD OBTAIN UNITY AND FREEDOM . MOVIEGOERS WHO HAVE SEEN LAWRENCE

OF ARABIA KNOW THE GLOOMY RESULT : UNDER LEAGUE OF NATION MANDATES,

MOST OF THE MIDDLE EAST WAS HANDED OVER TO BRITAIN AND FRANCE, AND

FRUSTRATED ARABS WASTED THEMSELVES IN FUTILE REBELLIONS AGAINST THE

COLONIAL POWERS . WORLD WAR II DID LITTLE BETTER FOR THE ARAB

NATIONALISTS . INDIVIDUAL STATES GAINED INDEPENDENCE, BUT CONTROL WAS

SECURELY HELD BY FEUDAL MONARCHS OR COALITIONS OF LANDOWNERS AND

BUSINESSMEN WHO WERE OFTEN LITTLE MORE THAN COLONIAL PUPPETS . SIR

WINSTON CHURCHILL " INVENTED " THE STATE OF JORDAN " ON A SUNDAY

AFTERNOON IN JERUSALEM . " EVEN WORSE, IN THE ARAB VIEW, WAS THE

PARTITION OF PALESTINE TO PROVIDE A NATIONAL HOMELAND FOR THE JEWS .

HUMILIATION BECAME COMPLETE IN 1948, WHEN THE COMBINED ARMIES OF THE

ARAB COUNTRIES WERE CRUSHINGLY DEFEATED BY THE ISRAELIS . MOON ORBIT .

HENCE THE ENORMOUS PRESTIGE NASSER WON IN 1956, WHEN HE SURVIVED THE

MASSED ASSAULT OF BRITAIN, FRANCE AND ISRAEL IN THE SUEZ WAR . ARABS

IGNORED THE FACT THAT THE EGYPTIANS WERE BEATEN IN THE FIELD AND THAT

ONLY INTERVENTION BY THE U.S . AND THE SOVIET UNION SAVED NASSER FROM

COLLAPSE . WHAT MATTERED WAS THAT NASSER HAD ENGAGED THE IMPERIALISTS

AND ISRAEL IN BATTLE, AND MANAGED TO SURVIVE . WHEN EGYPT LATER PROVED

THAT IT HAD THE TECHNICAL SKILL TO OPERATE THE SUEZ CANAL EFFICIENTLY

ON ITS OWN, ARAB NATIONALISTS WERE AS PROUD AS IF NASSER HAD PERSONALLY

ORBITED THE MOON . HIS ARAB BRETHREN ALSO SHARE PRIDE IN NASSER'S

ACHIEVEMENTS AT HOME IN THE YEARS SINCE SUEZ . CAIRO, A CITY AS

POPULOUS AS CHICAGO, HAS BECOME A BUSTLING, BUSY METROPOLIS . NEW

SKYSCRAPERS LINE THE BANKS OF THE NILE, THROWING GLITTERING LIGHT ON

THE RIVER AT NIGHT AND BY DAY REFLECTING IN THEIR GLASS WALLS THE

STATELY GRACE OF THE SAILS OF FELUCCAS HEADED UPRIVER WITH CARGOES OF

WHEAT AND LIME . THE BUILDING BOOM IS NOT CONFINED TO THE HOTELS, WHICH

WERE HOST THIS WINTER TO A RECORD HALF-MILLION TOURISTS . ON THE EDGE

OF THE CITY, ENTIRE NEW SUBURBS ARE IN BEING OR ABUILDING . AT MEDINET

EL WAQF, EGYPT'S NEW MANAGERS ARE HOUSED IN MODERN STUCCO COTTAGES . ON

THE NORTHERN RIM OF THE CITY, 40,000 LOW-COST HOUSING UNITS WERE

ERECTED LAST YEAR . BUT MOST OF CAIRO REMAINS THE SAME : CLOSE,

CROWDED AND CACOPHONOUS WITH HARD-PRESSED AUTO HORNS . IN IMBABA, ON

THE WEST BANK OF THE NILE, CAMELS STREAKED WITH HENNA STILL PLOD

UNKNOWINGLY TOWARD THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE, AND GULLY-GULLY MEN DELIGHT

BRIGHT-EYED, BROWN-FACED CHILDREN WITH MAGIC TRICKS AS THEY DID THEIR

GRANDFATHERS 50 YEARS AGO . IMBABA'S JUNK MARKET IS STILL UNCHANGED,

AND BENT NAILS AND HALF-SHOELACES ARE TRADED WITH SOLEMNITY AND

DILIGENCE . THE RED FLOWERPOT OF THE TARBOOSH HAS ALL BUT VANISHED FROM

CAIRENES' HEADS, AND NASSER HAS EVEN MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN HIS

CAMPAIGN TO GET HIS CITY FOLK TO SWITCH TO EUROPEAN CLOTHES FROM THE

NIGHTSHIRT-LIKE GALLABIYA . MOST ASTONISHING IS THE FACT THAT A VISITOR

SELDOM SEES A BAREFOOT MAN, WOMAN OR CHILD . EVEN URCHINS FROM THE

CAIRO SLUMS WEAR SHOES AND SOCKS . TODAY CAIRO WALKS WELL-DRESSED,

WELL-SHOD AND BAREHEADED, WITH ITS SHOULDERS BACK .

SWALLOWED REVENUES . OF ALL EGYPTIANS, THE

INDUSTRIAL WORKER HAS FARED THE BEST UNDER NASSER . NEXT TO HIM COMES

THE FELLAH, THE TIMELESS PEASANT WORKING THE TIMELESS LAND . IT WAS THE

JEST OF 1952 THAT NASSER'S FOREMOST AMBITION WAS TO RAISE THE FELLAHIN

AT LEAST TO THE LIVING STANDARD OF THE GAMOOSA, THE WATER BUFFALO OF

THE NILE . HE HAS MORE THAN SUCCEEDED . YOU CAN SEE IT SIMPLY IN THE

FELLAH'S CLOTHES . BUT ALSO THE FELLAH, WHO USED TO HAVE MEAT ONLY ONCE

OR TWICE A YEAR, NOW EATS IT AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK . IN PRE-NASSER

EGYPT, THE MOST COMMON CHARACTERISTIC OF THE FELLAHIN WAS SUMMED UP IN

THE PHRASE ANNA MALI, WHICH ROUGHLY TRANSLATES, " I COULDN'T CARE LESS

. " TODAY THE WORD HEARD OVER AND OVER IS NAHDHA, A TERM MEANING TO SIT

UP AND TAKE NOTICE OF THE WORLD AROUND YOU . EGYPT HAS BEEN AWAKE,

TAKING NOTICE AND PARTICIPATING SINCE THE HOT SUMMER MORNING IN JULY

1952, WHEN NASSER AND A GROUP OF YOUNG ARMY OFFICERS PUT AN END TO THE

REGIME OF KING FAROUK . THE RESULTING ECONOMIC UPSURGE WAS HARDLY

ACCOMPLISHED BY EGYPT ALONE . THE INTENSE DEVELOPMENT CAMPAIGN

SWALLOWED UP REVENUES FROM THE SUEZ CANAL, AND FROM THE BIGGEST CROP,

COTTON . IN THE PROCESS, THE NATION HAS SPENT ITS SAVINGS . EGYPT'S

FOREIGN-EXCHANGE RESERVES, WHICH STOOD AT A BILLION DOLLARS AFTER WORLD

WAR II, HAVE DWINDLED TO SCARCELY $10 MILLION . THE CONSEQUENCE IS AN

INCREASING DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN AID . THE COMMUNIST BLOC HAS COMMITTED

ITSELF TO $700 MILLION IN ECONOMIC AID SINCE 1955, AND RUSSIA IS

FOOTING THE BILL FOR THE FAMED HIGH DAM AT ASWAN, WHICH BY 1972 WILL

INCREASE THE ARABLE LAND OF EGYPT FROM 6,000,000 ACRES TO 8,000,000

ACRES AND SUPPLY 10 BILLION KW-H IN ELECTRIC POWER . SINCE 1945, THE

U.S . HAS SUPPLIED EGYPT WITH $628.6 MILLION, MOSTLY IN THE FORM OF

SURPLUS FOOD PAID FOR IN EGYPTIAN POUNDS, 85 PER CENT OF WHICH CAN BE

(AND IS) LOANED BACK TO EGYPT . TODAY, EGYPT IS DEPENDENT ON THE U.S .

FOR ITS FOOD, AND ON RUSSIA FOR ITS ARMS AND THE ASWAN DAM . THE FACT

IS THAT NASSER IS NOT TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON ANY ONE POWER OR GROUP OF

POWERS . HE IS STILL DETERMINEDLY NONALIGNED . BUT THINGS ARE BETTER

THAN THE WORD IMPLIES . A FEW YEARS AGO, NASSER WAS NONALIGNED TOWARD

THE EAST ; TODAY, HE IS MORE ACCURATELY REGARDED AS NONALIGNED TOWARD

THE WEST . HAPPY NAUSEA . BUT NASSER'S ONE-MAN RULE HAS NOT BROUGHT

UNMITIGATED BLISS TO EGYPT . THE BANKS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES WERE

NATIONALIZED, AND THEIR OWNERS PAID OFF PARTLY IN BONDS THAT MAY NOT BE

REDEEMED FOR YEARS TO COME . CONTRACTORS WHOSE EARNINGS REACH $69,000 A

YEAR ARE TAKEN OVER, OR FORCED TO ACCEPT JOINT PARTICIPATION BY THE

GOVERNMENT . WIPED OUT ARE THE GREAT LANDOWNERS ; FARM HOLDINGS ARE

NOW LIMITED TO 100 ACRES PER FAMILY . THIS FORM OF SOCIALISM IS BENIGN

ENOUGH . IT LEAVES MOST OF THE NATION'S COMMERCE IN PRIVATE HANDS AND

DOES NOT AFFECT THE OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF SMALL FARMERS, WHO OWN FAR

LESS THAN 100 ACRES . THE PRESS WAS NATIONALIZED IN 1960, AND ITS

EDITORS ARE PICKED BY THE REGIME ,; THEY, OF COURSE, DO NOT CRITICIZE

NASSER'S POLICIES . POLITICAL ACTIVITY IN THE USUAL SENSE IS BANNED

BECAUSE, AS NASSER PUTS IT, " IF I HAD THREE POLITICAL PARTIES, ONE

WOULD BE RUN BY THE RICH, ONE BY THE SOVIETS, AND ONE BY THE U.S . "

THE ONLY PARTY PERMITTED BY LAW IS THE OFFICIAL ARAB SOCIALIST UNION,

WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE DEMOCRACY BY ITS REPRESENTATION IN EVERY

VILLAGE, FACTORY AND URBAN DISTRICT . THERE, LEADERS ARE CHOSEN TO

PASS LOCAL VIEWS ALONG TO PROVINCIAL AND NATIONAL COMMITTEES .

NASSER'S REVOLUTION

HAS NEVER BEEN PARTICULARLY

TOTALITARIAN, BUT THERE WAS A

NASTY PERIOD IN LATE 1961, WHEN SYRIA

BROKE AWAY FROM EGYPT . HUNDREDS OF

PEOPLE, INCLUDING ARMY OFFICERS, WERE ARRESTED . FOREIGN DIPLOMATS WERE

SHADOWED BY SECRET POLICE . BUT SINCE THEN, THE ATMOSPHERE OF FEAR HAS

LARGELY VANISHED . GENERAL MOHAMMED NAGUIB, THE 1952 REVOLUTION'S FIRST

LEADER, WHO SERVED FOR TWO YEARS AS A FRONT FOR NASSER AND WAS THEN

DEPOSED, STILL LIVES QUIETLY IN A CAIRO VILLA NEAR THE NILE AND IS

PERMITTED TO MOVE FAIRLY FREELY ABOUT THE CITY . OLD NAHAS PASHA AND

OTHER FORMER WAFDIST ENEMIES OF THE NEW REGIME REMAIN IN THEIR HOMES,

WHICH, IN MOST CASES, THEY HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO KEEP . NASSER'S

GOVERNMENT HAS MOVED IMPRESSIVELY INTO THE FIELDS OF EDUCATION AND

HEALTH . PRIMARY SCHOOLS WERE ERECTED AND STAFFED AT A RATE OF TWO

EVERY THREE DAYS . EDUCATION IS FREE, AND EGYPT'S UNIVERSITIES ARE

CRAMMED WITH 126,000 STUDENTS, INCLUDING 20,000 FROM OTHER ARAB LANDS .

IMPROVED HYGIENE AND FREE CLINICS HAVE ONLY INCREASED THE POPULATION

PRESSURE : THE NEW ARABLE LAND TO BE PROVIDED BY THE ASWAN DAM WILL BE

BARELY ENOUGH TO FEED THE ESTIMATED 55 MILLION POPULATION IN 20 YEARS .

IN SORT, AT TREMENDOUS COST, EGYPT WILL NOT HAVE GONE FORWARD BUT

MERELY STOOD STILL WITH THIS CHALLENGE, NASSER HAS BEGUN A NATIONWIDE

BIRTH CONTROL CAMPAIGN . ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES ARE BEING SOLD BELOW COST

(A MONTH'S SUPPLY FOR 46 #$ ), AND EGYPTIAN WOMEN ARE SAID TO RELISH

THE PILLS BECAUSE THEY INDUCE THE SAME FEELING OF NAUSEA EXPERIENCED IN

PREGNANCY .

THE PRESSURE OF EGYPT'S MILLIONS, IN FACT, IS ONE OF THE

THINGS THAT MAKES OTHER ARAB STATES WARY OF BEING TOO CLOSELY EMBRACED

BY NASSER . EGYPT, LIKE CHINA, IS ALWAYS THREATENING TO SPILL OVER ITS

BORDERS INTO THE RELATIVELY EMPTY LAND OF ITS NEIGHBORS .

INDIVIDUALISTIC ARABS, AS WELL, ARE NERVOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT

DISAPPEARING INTO THE STRAITJACKET OF NASSER'S ONEMAN RULE . LAPS OF

GENERALS . TO THESE DISSENTERS, THERE IS ANOTHER FLASHING BEACON OF

ARAB UNITY : THE BAATH (RENAISSANCE) PARTY, WHICH DOMINATES THE NEW

GOVERNMENTS IN BOTH IRAQ AND SYRIA . THE STREET MOBS AND IMPATIENT

YOUNG ARMY OFFICERS MAY WORSHIP NASSER, BUT ARAB STUDENTS AND

INTELLECTUALS BOW BEFORE THE CREATOR OF BAATH, A TINY, BEAK-NOSED,

MEEK-CHINNED SYRIAN NAMED MICHEL AFLAK . AFLAK, 53, AN ARAB CHRISTIAN

WHO COUNTS HIS AMBER WORRY BEADS THREE AT A TIME, SHUNS CROWDS AND

HOLDS NO POST IN ANY GOVERNMENT, MAKES AN INCONGRUOUS RIVAL TO THE

BRASH, BURLY, GOOD-LOOKING NASSER . NO CROWDS HAVE EVER SHRIEKED OVER

HIM, CHANTED HIS NAME OR PARADED HIS PICTURE . HE LIVES IN A SMALL,

CRAMPED DAMASCUS APARTMENT WITH A FRAYED CARPET, CHEAP FURNITURE, AND

CLOTHES DRYING ON A BALCONY WASHLINE . HIS TWO INFANT CHILDREN TODDLE

ABOUT AND, LAST WEEK, CLAMBERED ON THE LAPS OF GENERALS AND CABINET

MINISTERS WHO CROWDED AFLAK'S PARLOR . THE SON OF A NATIONALIST-MINDED

SHOPKEEPER, AFLAK PASSIONATELY EMBRACED THE IDEAL OF ARAB UNITY AS A

DAMASCUS SCHOOLBOY . HIS EDUCATION AT THE SORBONNE IN PARIS, WHERE HE

GRADUATED WITH HONORS IN HISTORY, WAS FINANCED BY A SUCCESSFUL UNCLE

WHO HAD EMIGRATED TO BRAZIL . AFTER A BRIEF TEACHING CAREER AT A

DAMASCUS LYCEE, AFLAK RESIGNED IN 1942 TO DEVOTE HIS LIFE TO POLITICS

AND TO HIS PERSONAL CREATION, THE BAATH PARTY . WHAT AFLAK CREATED WAS

A MYSTIC AND LYRICAL HYMN TO WAHADI ARABIYA (ARAB ONENESS), AND HE

OVERFLOWS WITH SUCH SENTIMENTS AS " NATIONALISM IS LOVE BEFORE

EVERYTHING ELSE, " AND " A NEW PAGE IS OPEN, THE PAGE OF THOSE WHO WALK

WITH NAKED SOULS AS IF THEY WERE IN THEIR OWN BEDROOM . " HE DEFINES

REVOLUTION AS " THAT POWERFUL PSYCHIC CURRENT, THAT MANDATORY STRUGGLE,

WITHOUT WHICH THE REAWAKENING OF A NATION CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD . " THE

BAATH SLOGAN, " UNITY, FREEDOM, SOCIALISM, " WAS BLANDLY APPROPRIATED

BY NASSER FOR HIS OWN USE, BUT NASSER HAS SHOWN NO EAGERNESS TO TAKE

OVER OTHER BAATH TENETS, SUCH AS FREE ELECTIONS, FREE PRESS, AND

FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND ASSEMBLY . FROM SYRIA, BAATHISM MOVED SWIFTLY TO

IRAQ AND JORDAN, MORE SLOWLY TO KUWAIT AND SAUDI ARABIA . ALTHOUGH THE

PARTY IS ANTIBOURGEOIS, MOST OF ITS ADHERENTS COME FROM MIDDLE-CLASS

INTELLECTUALS AND SMALL SHOPKEEPERS . BAATH MADE CONSERVATIVE

GOVERNMENTS NERVOUS WITH ITS SOCIALISM (WHICH IS ACTUALLY A BLEND OF

MILD MARXISM AND THE NEW DEAL), AND WAS ATTACKED BY THE COMMUNISTS AS A

DEVIATING EXPONENT OF WEAK LIBERALISM . IN SYRIA, DURING THE COURSE OF

14 YEARS AND NINE DIFFERENT COUPS, THE BAATH PARTY BOBBED UP AND DOWN .

NOT UNTIL 1958, WHEN SYRIA'S COMMUNISTS WERE PLOTTING AN ARMED

TAKEOVER, WERE THE BAATHISTS ABLE TO STAMPEDE SYRIAN CONSERVATIVES INTO

ACCEPTING UNITY WITH EGYPT AS THE LESSER EVIL . SLIPPED BORDER . UNITY

WAS OBTAINED, BUT AT A HIGH PRICE . ONCE IN CONTROL, NASSER INSISTED ON

THE ABOLITION OF ALL PARTIES, BAATH INCLUDED, AND FIXED ON SYRIA THE

SAME TIGHT CONTROLS AND SECURITY-POLICE SYSTEM AS IN EGYPT . DESIGNATED

AS THE NORTHERN REGION OF THE UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC, SYRIA WAS FLOODED

BY OFFICIOUS EGYPTIAN BRASS AND CRAMPED BY NASSER'S AUTHORITARIAN

ECONOMIC SCHEMES . SYRIAN OFFICERS WHO PROTESTED FOUND THEMSELVES

TRANSFERRED TO DUTY DEEP IN EGYPT ; CIVILIANS QUICKLY LANDED IN JAIL .

AT LAST, EVEN MICHEL AFLAK REBELLED AND ORDERED THE BAATH CABINET

MINISTERS TO RESIGN IN A BODY, SETTING THE STAGE FOR SYRIA'S ANGRY

SECESSION FROM THE U.A.R .

IN IRAQ THE BAATH PARTY FACED CRISIS FROM THE

MOMENT DICTATOR KARIM KASSEM ESTABLISHED HIS BLOODY DICTATORSHIP IN

1958 . THE BAATHISTS PARTICIPATED IN AN ARMED REVOLT IN THE OIL CENTER

OF MOSUL, WHICH KASSEM SAVAGELY SUPPRESSED WITH THE HELP OF IRAQ'S

COMMUNIST MILITIA . A BAATHIST GROUP TRIED TO KILL KASSEM, BUT FAILED

AND WAS BUTCHERED . FINALLY, LAST MONTH, BAATHIST POLITICIANS AND

PRO-NASSER MILITARY MEN ORGANIZED AND EXECUTED THE COUP THAT RESULTED

IN

THE DEATH OF KASSEM AND THE SLAUGHTER OF HUNDREDS OF HIS COMMUNIST

ALLIES . FOUR WEEKS LATER WITH FAR LESS BLOOD BAATHISTS AND PRO-NASSER

OFFICERS IN DAMASCUS BRUSHED ASIDE THE CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT OF SYRIA

. THE WAY AT LAST WAS OPEN FOR THE UNITY THAT EVERYONE HAD BEEN TALKING

ABOUT . COMPLETE LESSON . THE DIFFICULTY, OF COURSE, IS THAT EVERYONE

WANTS UNITY ON HIS OWN TERMS . EVEN JORDAN'S KING HUSSEIN, WHO IS

ANATHEMA TO NASSER AND THE BAATHISTS, SAYS HE HOPES FOR EVENTUAL

RECONCILIATION WITH HIS ENEMIES AND ADMISSION OF JORDAN INTO THE ARAB

UNION . IF NECESSARY, HUSSEIN TOLD NEWSMEN, HE WOULD ABDICATE TO

ACHIEVE ARAB UNITY . BUT HE QUICKLY ADDED, " PROVIDED IT'S UNITY ON A

PROPER BASIS . " MICHEL AFLAK REPLIES : " JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA ARE

WELCOME TO JOIN THE ARAB UNION, BUT NOT WITH THEIR PRESENT REGIMES AND

RULERS . " IN CAIRO PRESIDENT NASSER HAS GIVEN EVERY INDICATION THAT HE

INTENDS TO AVOID THE MISTAKES MADE DURING THE HURRIED AND ILL-FATED

UNION WITH SYRIA . " THE MAIN REASON FOR THE LACK OF SUCCESS, " NASSER

TOLD TIME LAST WEEK, " WAS THAT WE ACCEPTED COMPLETE UNION AND

AMALGAMATION, INSTEAD OF FEDERATION AND SELF-GOVERNMENT IN BOTH STATES

. " TO BEGIN DISCUSSION OF A BETTER SYSTEM, IRAQI AND SYRIAN

DELEGATIONS FLEW INTO CAIRO FORTNIGHT AGO FOR PRELIMINARY TALKS WITH

NASSER . LAST WEEK AN EVEN MORE HIGH-POWERED GROUP OF SYRIANS ARRIVED,

HEADED BY MICHEL AFLAK AND PREMIER SALAH EL-BITAR, WITH THE INTENTION

OF LAYING DOWN A SOLID FOUNDATION FOR THE PROPOSED UNITY STRUCTURE .

THIS WEEK ANOTHER SET OF DELEGATES FROM SYRIA AND IRAQ WILL RETURN TO

CAIRO, EACH BRINGING A DRAFT PROJECT FOR A NEW UNION . NOISE IN ALEPPO

. IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT ANY KIND OF FEDERATION WITH CENTRALIZED

AUTHORITY WILL EMERGE . WHAT IS POSSIBLE IS A LOOSE ALLIANCE, WITH

HARMONIZED DEFENSE AND FOREIGN POLICIES . THERE MIGHT ALSO BE A DEGREE

OF ECONOMIC COOPERATION AMONG THE THREE NATIONS, POSSIBLY INCLUDING

EVEN YEMEN, WHICH IS SO BACKWARD THAT IT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS "

RUSHING INTO THE 13TH CENTURY . " SUCH A SYSTEM OF SOVEREIGN STATES

WOULD REPRESENT A TACIT ADMISSION THAT ARABS ARE NOT ALL ALIKE AND THAT

THEIR INTERESTS DO NOT ALWAYS COINCIDE . THE FACT THAT THE TALKS

BETWEEN SYRIANS, IRAQIS AND EGYPTIANS HAVE NOT YET PRODUCED ANYTHING

CONCRETE IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE FACT THAT THEY ARE, AT LEAST,

TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER AND NOT SCREAMING IMPRECATIONS AS THEY HAVE DONE

SO OFTEN IN THE PAST . BUT ALREADY SOME ARABS WERE BECOMING IMPATIENT .

THERE WERE PRO-NASSER DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE SYRIAN PORT OF ALEPPO . IN

DAMASCUS A TOUGH YOUNG NASSERITE WHO HAD MOVED DIRECTLY FROM A PRISON

CELL TO AN ORNATE GOVERNMENT OFFICE DISMISSED THE BAATHISTS AS

IDEOLOGISTS, NOT POLITICAL LEADERS . " WE ARE GOING TO RUN SYRIA WITH

NASSER THE WAY WE WANT, " HE SAID . " WE ARE GOING TO UNITE WITH EGYPT

THE WAY NASSER WANTS . " BLASTING PATHS ? THE FACT THAT THE MIDDLE

EAST IS SO CONSISTENTLY COMBUSTIBLE AND HAS SO LOW AN IGNITION POINT

MAKES ITS AFFAIRS OF DEEP IMPORTANCE TO OTHER POWERS . IN THE OLD CITY

OF JERUSALEM LAST WEEK, ARABS WERE JARRED BY RECURRENT DULL EXPLOSIONS

IN THE BORDER AREAS, AND THERE WAS SPECULATION THAT ISRAELI DEMOLITION

SQUADS WERE BLOWING UP OLD MINES IN NOMAN'S LAND TO CLEAR LANES FOR AN

ADVANCE INTO JORDAN SHOULD KING HUSSEIN BE OVERTHROWN BY NASSERITES .

ISRAEL IS NOT IMPRESSED BY SUGGESTIONS THAT EGYPT'S RULER HAS

GIVEN UP HIS DOMINEERING WAYS . ONE OFFICIAL IN TEL AVIV WARNED : "

NASSER FINDS IT DIFFICULT TO RESIST TEMPTATION . SUCCESS TURNS HIS

HEAD, AND BEING BASICALLY A MILITARY MAN, HE THINKS IN TERMS OF

EXTERNAL EXPANSION . " THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT SEES A HINT OF NASSER'S

DREAMS OF GRANDEUR IN HIS YEMEN ADVENTURE, WHICH HAS ALREADY TIED UP

ONE-THIRD OF HIS ARMY ISRAEL'S STATED POLICY IS THAT ANY CHANGE IN THE

INTERNAL SITUATION OF HER ARAB NEIGHBORS AFFECTING THE SECURITY OF HER

BORDERS WOULD FREE ISRAEL OF HER UNDERTAKING TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO

. MANY ARABS FEAR THAT ISRAEL WOULD MOVE TROOPS STRAIGHT TO THE WEST

BANK OF THE JORDAN RIVER . IF HUSSEIN'S REGIME COLLAPSES . FAT OR THIN

. BRITAIN'S

PRESENT RELATIONS WITH EGYPT ARE CORRECT BUT COOL . WHILE RECOGNIZING

NASSER'S PRE-EMINENCE IN THE ARAB WORLD AND HIS GREAT ABILITIES, THE

BRITISH REMAIN WARY OF THE MAN AND HIS POLICIES . UNDERSTANDABLY,

BRITAIN IS WORRIED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF ITS FEW REMAINING MIDDLE EAST

COLONIES AND ITS IMPORTANT OIL INTERESTS . " NASSER'S OWN STAND ON OIL

IS AMBIGUOUS, " COMPLAINS ONE DIPLOMAT . " OF COURSE, HE WOULD LIKE TO

CONTROL OIL-RICH KUWAIT, BUT SO WOULD EVERYONE ELSE . " BRITISH AND U.S

. OIL EXECUTIVES, THOUGH ADMITTING TO SOME UNEASINESS ABOUT NASSER'S

INTENTIONS, SEE NO IMMEDIATE THREAT TO THE MIDDLE EAST'S DAILY FLOW OF

6,500,000 BBL . " WE HAVE LEARNED TO LIVE WITH POLITICAL INSTABILITY, "

SAYS ONE OILMAN STOICALLY . THEIR FEAR IS NOT THAT THE WEST WILL LOSE

ACCESS TO THE MIDDLE EAST'S PROVEN OIL RESERVES OF 194 BILLION BBL.,

BUT THAT ANY NEW ARAB GROUPING MIGHT START A CAMPAIGN TO REDUCE THE

PRODUCER'S PROFITS . " ARAB UNITY MAY BE GOOD OR BAD FOR THE OIL

INDUSTRY, " EXPLAINED ONE OFFICIAL . " IT DEPENDS ON THE GOALS OF UNITY

AND THESE ARE DIFFICULT TO DISCERN IN THE PRESENT SITUATION . " DRAWN

LINE . SHARPLY HOSTILE AFTER NASSER'S SUEZ NATIONALIZATION, AND NERVOUS

AT HIS FLIRTATION WITH THE COMMUNISTS, U.S . POLICY MORE RECENTLY HAS

TURNED IN NASSER'S FAVOR . RECALLING THE DAYS NOT SO LONG AGO WHEN

CAIRO RADIO WAS SPOUTING UGLY LIES ABOUT THE U.S., WASHINGTON IS NOT

INCLINED TO BE NASSER'S SPONSOR . BUT THE U.S . CAN COOPERATE WITH THE

MAN WHOSE NAME IS ON EVERY ARAB LIP . OFFICIALLY, THE U.S . AIMS AT

ASSISTING ANY GOVERNMENT, NO MATTER WHAT ITS FORM, THAT APPEARS TO BE

SINCERELY AND EFFECTIVELY WORKING FOR INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE GOOD

OF ITS PEOPLE . WITH INDIFFERENCE TO SOCIAL SYSTEMS, THE U.S . HAS

AIDED EGYPT ON THE LEFT AND IRAN ON THE RIGHT, RECOGNIZED THE

MONARCHIES OF JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA AS WELL AS PRO-NASSER YEMEN . BUT

THERE IS A LINE DRAWN BY THE U.S . " IF THE COLD WAR IN THE ARAB WORLD

THREATENS THE LARGE AMERICAN INTERESTS IN, SAY, SAUDI ARABIA, WE'LL

HAVE TO TAKE A STAND, " SAYS A U.S . OFFICIAL . SIMILARLY, THE U.S .

CONSIDERS ITSELF NONALIGNED IN THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE ARAB

WORLD . WASHINGTON'S ATTITUDE TOWARD ARAB UNION IS STILL TIED TO A

PRONOUNCEMENT MADE BY SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN FOSTER DULLES DURING THE

EISENHOWER ADMINISTRATION . DULLES SAID THEN, AND IT WAS REPEATED LAST

WEEK IN WASHINGTON, THAT THE U.S . LOOKS WITH FAVOR ON ANY MOVEMENT

TOWARD ARAB UNION THAT IS NOT IMPOSED FROM OUTSIDE THE ARAB WORLD .

GREAT COUPS . NASSER TODAY TAKES AN INDULGENT VIEW OF THE U.S . HIS

EARLIER RESENTMENTS, HE SAYS, RESULTED FROM AMERICAN ATTEMPTS TO FORCE

EGYPT INTO JOINING SUCH " IMPERIALIST " GROUPINGS AS THE MEDITERRANEAN

DEFENSE ORGANIZATION AND THE BAGHDAD PACT . NASSER APPLAUDS THE PRESENT

ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON BECAUSE " KENNEDY TRIED FROM THE FIRST TO

UNDERSTAND US AND TO BE REALISTIC WHEN FACING THE ARAB WORLD . UNDER

JOHN FOSTER DULLES, THE U.S . WITHDREW ITS AID FOR THE ASWAN DAM, WE

FACED BLOCKADE AND EVEN THE BLOCKING OF OUR OWN MONEY IN U.S . BANKS .

/ HOWEVER, NASSER CONCEDES, " IT SHOULD NOT BE FORGOTTEN THAT THE U.S .

STOOD BY US IN THE UNITED NATIONS DURING THE SUEZ CRISIS, AND THAT LEFT

A GOOD IMPRESSION . " PRESIDENT NASSER AND PRESIDENT KENNEDY HAVE

BECOME CLOSE CORRESPONDENTS . " WE ARE VERY FRANK WITH EACH OTHER, "

SAYS NASSER . " WE DON'T EXCHANGE DIPLOMATIC WORDS BUT EXPRESS HONEST

AND FRANK OPINIONS . I BELIEVE WE HAVE BUILT UP A CONFIDENCE IN EACH

OTHER . " THE CONFIDENCE EXTENDS TO U.S . AMBASSADOR JOHN BADEAU, WHO

SPEAKS FLUENT ARABIC AND HAS UNLIMITED ACCESS TO NASSER, WHILE HIS

BRITISH COUNTERPART SEES NASSER ONLY TWICE A YEAR AT FORMAL MEETINGS .

THE COMMUNISTS ARE SO CONVINCED THAT THE U.S . CONTROLS EVENTS IN THE

MIDDLE EAST THAT THE POLISH AMBASSADOR IN CAIRO STOPPED A U.S .

DIPLOMAT AT THE ENTRANCE TO A LUNCHEON PARTY AND SAID BITTERLY : " I

MUST CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR TREMENDOUS ACHIEVEMENTS IN IRAQ AND SYRIA

. YOU HAVE MADE TWO GREAT COUPS . " JIGGLED LEG . AT WEEK'S END IN

CAIRO, THE CONFERENCES ON ARAB UNITY DRONED ON TO THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF

CIGARETTE SMOKE AND ENDLESS SMALL CUPS OF COFFEE . NASSER SAT IN ON THE

NEGOTIATIONS, SERENELY CONFIDENT THAT WHAT FINALLY EMERGED WOULD BE

WHAT HE WANTED . AT 45, NASSER'S HAIR HAS GREYED AT THE TEMPLES, AND HE

HAS GIVEN UP TENNIS FOR THE LESS DEMANDING SPORT OF SWIMMING . HE

APPEARS AS PHYSICALLY FIT AS EVER AND RETAINS HIS OLD NERVOUS HABITS OF

JIGGLING HIS LEG WHILE SITTING, AND OF SMOKING FIVE PACKS OF L . & M.S

A DAY ; LIKE MOST EGYPTIANS, HE CANNOT STAND THE LOCAL BRANDS . HE

STILL WORKS TWELVE AND 18 HOURS AT A CLIP AND IS STILL THE ONLY MAN IN

THE GOVERNMENT WHO CAN BE REACHED AT ANY HOUR . A CLOSE AIDE SAYS : "

I'VE NEVER HEARD OF ANYONE GETTING CHEWED OUT FOR CALLING NASSER IN THE

MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT . I DO KNOW OF MANY WHO HAVE BEEN GIVEN UNSHIRTED

HELL FOR NOT CALLING HIM WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENED . HE WON'T LIKE YOU TO

SAY THIS, BUT IT IS STILL STRICTLY A ONE-MAN SHOW . HE HAS LOTS OF GOOD

TECHNICAL HELP, BUT HE TRUSTS NO ONE ELSE WITH POLITICS . " EVEN MORE

THAN RUSSIANS, ARABS EXPRESS THEIR FOLK WISDOM IN PROVERBS, RANGING

FROM THE CAUTIONARY (SEE COVER) TO THE RACIALLY SKEPTICAL ( " BETTER

THE TYRANNY OF THE TURKS THAN THE JUSTICE OF THE ARABS " ) . THERE ARE

PROVERBS APLENTY TO FIT THE DREAM OF UNITY . TO THE AMBITIOUS NASSER,

OTHER ARAB LEADERS MIGHT POINT OUT THE ONE THAT SAYS, " THE CAMEL

DRIVER HAS HIS PLANS, AND THE CAMEL HAS HIS . " BUT PROVERBS ARE

ECLIPSED BY POWER, AND LAST WEEK NOTHING WAS MORE CERTAIN THAN THAT

WHATEVER UNITY SCHEME EMERGES IN THE MIDDLE EAST, MUST, FIRST OF ALL,

BE SATISFACTORY TO GAMAL ABDEL NASSER . FOR OF ALL THE REVOLUTIONS

INVOLVED, ONLY HIS IN EGYPT HAS SURVIVED AND PROSPERED FOR A FULL TEN

YEARS .

GREAT BRITAIN WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO CHRISTINE KEELER

? SHE WAS JUST ANOTHER GIRL FROM MIDDLESEX WHO CALLED HERSELF A MODEL

A EUPHEMISM AS VAGUE AS " STARLET " AND WITH JUST AS MANY IMPLICATIONS

. BUT LEGGY, REDHEADED CHRISTINE KEELER, 21, MANAGED TO MOVE IN

MAYFAIR'S SMARTEST CIRCLES AND NUMBERED AMONG HER WIDE RANGE OF

GENTLEMEN ACQUAINTANCES TOP NAMES IN LONDON'S POLITICAL, SOCIAL,

DIPLOMATIC AND SHOW BUSINESS WORLDS . LAST WEEK THE SOCIAL LIFE OF

CHRISTINE KEELER, ONETIME WAITRESS AND FULLTIME PLAYGIRL, WAS ALL OVER

THE FRONT PAGES OF THE BRITISH PRESS . CHRISTINE'S SPONSOR WAS A SOCIAL

GADABOUT NAMED STEPHEN WARD, 43, AN ARTIST AND OSTEOPATH WHO LIVES IN A

THAMESSIDE SUMMER HOUSE ON VISCOUNT ASTOR'S FAMED ESTATE AT CLIVEDEN .

/ I KNOW A LOT OF VERY IMPORTANT PEOPLE AND AM OFTEN RECEIVED IN SOME

OF THE MOST FAMOUS HOMES IN THE COUNTRY, " SAYS WARD . " SIR WINSTON

CHURCHILL AND MANY LEADING POLITICIANS HAVE BEEN AMONG MY PATIENTS ;

PRINCE PHILIP, THE DUKE AND DUCHESS OF KENT AND LORD SNOWDON HAVE BEEN

AMONG MY SITTERS . " WARD ALSO HAD A GENUINE INTEREST IN YOUNG GIRLS OF

HUMBLE ORIGIN . " I LIKE PRETTY GIRLS, " HE SAYS . " I AM SENSITIVE TO

THE NEEDS AND THE STRESSES OF MODERN LIVING . " TO THE GREAT AND NEAR

GREAT, WARD INTRODUCED " ATTRACTIVE YOUNG GIRLS LIKE CHRISTINE KEELER,

WHO COME FROM THE PROVINCES OR THE REMOTE SUBURBS " AND FOR WHOM "

LONDON IS A BATTLEFIELD . " CHAIN OF EVENTS . WARD ARRANGED AN

UNSUCCESSFUL SCREEN TEST FOR CHRISTINE WITH DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS JR.,

INTRODUCED HER TO A NAVAL ATTACHE AT THE RUSSIAN EMBASSY, AND TO A "

SENIOR NAVAL OFFICER OF THE AMERICAN FLEET WHO SORTED OUT HER PROBLEMS

. " BUT CHRISTINE, SAID WARD, ALSO HAD " OCCASIONAL FOOLHARDY

ADVENTURES IN THE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WORLD OF COLORED MEN . " ONE DAY

LAST DECEMBER, JOHNNIE EDGECOMBE, CHRISTINE'S WEST INDIAN LOVER, SHOWED

UP OUTSIDE WARD'S WEST END FLAT, WHERE CHRISTINE WAS VISITING, AND

FIRED SEVERAL SHOTS AT THE DOOR . POLICE CARTED JOHNNIE AWAY AND TAGGED

CHRISTINE TO BE A PRINCIPAL WITNESS AT HIS TRIAL . THEN CAME A PECULIAR

CHAIN OF EVENTS . CHRISTINE KEELER FAILED TO SHOW UP FOR JOHNNIE'S

TRIAL, AND THE LEADING NEWSPAPERS HINTED THAT CHRISTINE FEARED

CROSS-EXAMINATION ABOUT HER PRIVATE LIFE AND HAD DROPPED OUT OF SIGHT

TO PROTECT HER PROMINENT FRIENDS . ON TOP OF THAT CAME NEWS THAT WARD'S

CLIVEDEN HOUSE, THE SCENE OF MANY A FASHIONABLE PARTY AND FORTUITOUS

INTRODUCTION, HAD BEEN RANSACKED ; WARD'S LETTERS WERE STOLEN, AND

SCATTERED ALL OVER THE FLOOR WERE A NUDE PHOTOGRAPH OF CHRISTINE AND A

SLEW OF PORNOGRAPHIC PICTURES, WHICH WARD CLAIMED WERE NOT HIS . IN

WHITEHALL AND IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS SMOKING ROOMS, RUMORS BEGAN

CIRCULATING THAT ONE OF CHRISTINE'S MANY ACQUAINTANCES WAS A GOVERNMENT

MINISTER .

CHEEK TO CHEEK . AT A LATE-NIGHT COMMONS

SESSION LAST WEEK, A LABOR M.P . UNEXPECTEDLY

ASKED THE GOVERNMENT " TO DENY

THE TRUTH OF THESE RUMORS :. INVOLVING

A MEMBER OF THE GOVERNMENT'S FRONT

BENCH . " ANOTHER M.P . TRIED TO MAKE LIGHT

OF THE ISSUE . " WHAT DO THESE RUMORS

AMOUNT TO ? " HE SAID . " THEY AMOUNT TO

THE FACT THAT A MINISTER HAS AN ACQUAINTANCE

WITH A VERY PRETTY GIRL . I SHOULD HAVE

THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS A MATTER FOR CONGRATULATION

RATHER THAN ENQUIRY . /

BUT LEFT-WING LABORITE BARBARA CASTLE

INSISTED ON GETTING BACK TO THE QUESTION

OF " MISS CHRISTINE KEELER, MISSING CALL

GIRL, VANISHED WITNESS . " WHAT, SHE ASKED,

 " IF THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE OF MUCH GREATER

IMPORTANCE ? WHAT IF THERE IS A QUESTION

OF THE PERVERSION OF JUSTICE AT STAKE ? /

FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S ANSWER NEXT

MORNING, THE COMMONS WAS PACKED . ON

THE FRONT BENCH WITH PRIME MINISTER HAROLD

MACMILLAN SAT URBANE TORY SECRETARY

OF STATE FOR WAR JOHN PROFUMO, 48, WHOSE

BEAUTIFUL ACTRESS WIFE VALERIE (GREAT

EXPECTATIONS) HOBSON SAT QUIETLY IN THE

SPEAKER'S GALLERY OVERHEAD . PROFUMO ROSE

AND CALMLY SAID, " I UNDERSTAND THAT MY

NAME HAS BEEN CONNECTED WITH THE RUMORS

ABOUT THE DISAPPEARANCE OF MISS KEELER . /

INDEED, PROFUMO SAID, HE AND HIS WIFE

HAD MET CHRISTINE AT CLIVEDEN, AND HE HAD

SUBSEQUENTLY SEEN HER " ON ABOUT SIX OCCASIONS

AT DR. WARD'S FLAT " IN LONDON . " I

LAST SAW MISS KEELER IN DECEMBER 1961,

AND I HAVE NOT SEEN HER SINCE . ANY SUGGESTION

THAT I WAS IN ANY WAY CONNECTED

WITH OR RESPONSIBLE FOR HER ABSENCE FROM

THE TRIAL IS WHOLLY  AND COMPLETELY UNTRUE .

THERE HAS BEEN NO IMPROPRIETY BETWEEN

MYSELF AND MISS KEELER . I SHALL NOT HESITATE

TO ISSUE WRITS FOR LIBEL AND SLANDER IF

SCANDALOUS STATEMENTS ARE MADE OUTSIDE

THIS HOUSE . /

CORN WHICH ARE EATEN WITH MILK . " UNFORTUNATELY, HE ADDED, " WE

CONSUME CORN IN NIGGARDLY AMOUNTS BECAUSE INDUSTRY DOES NOT PRODUCE THE

FOODS WE NEED CATCHING THE SPIRIT, IZVESTIA MADE ONE FINAL SUGGESTION

: RUSSIANS SHOULD EAT MORE POPCORN CALLED " AIR CORN " BY THE SOVIETS

FRANCE 6,000 MILES FROM HOME FORMER PREMIER MICHEL DEBRE IS SUCH

A LISTLESS POLITICAL PERSONALITY THAT A CURRENT JOKE SAYS HE WAS ONCE

SEEN RIDING IN AN EMPTY LIMOUSINE . HE HAS A FUSSY MANNER AND A FLAT-

WHINING VOICE THAT SOMEHOW RUB POLITICIANS AND MANY OTHER FRENCHMEN THE

WRONG WAY, OBSCURING HIS CONSIDERABLE ADMINISTRATIVE TALENTS . IN

DEBRE AS WHIPPING BOY FOR MANY OF THE REGIME'S MISTAKES, SOON FOUND,

HOWEVER, THAT HE SORELY MISSED DEBRE'S PARLIAMENTARY SKILL . GAULLIST

OF DARJEELING . BUT WHEN THE COUPLE ANNOUNCED PLANS TO MARRY LAST YEAR,

SIKKIMESE SOOTHSAYERS FORCED THE POSTPONEMENT OF THE WEDDING BECAUSE OF

THEIR FORECAST THAT 1962 WAS " A BLACK YEAR " FOR THE MARRIAGE . THUS

HOPE HAD TO WAIT UNTIL LAST WEEK TO BECOME THE FIRST AMERICAN GIRL TO

FOR A NEW HOME . THEY CHOSE THE ISLAND OF BALI, AND SINCE THEIR EXALTED

RANK DEMANDED A HIGH DWELLING PLACE, THEY CREATED A CHIN OF MOUNTAINSE

MOST SACRED EASTERN END OF THE ISLAND, THE GODS ERECTED THE HIGHEST OF

BALI'S MOUNTAINS, THE 10,308FOOT VOLCANO OF GUNUNG AGUNG, REGARDED BY

THE BALINESE AS " THE NAVEL OF THE WORLD . " HALFWAY UP THE SLOPE OF

AGUNG, THE PIOUS BALINESE BUILT THE HUGE MOTHER TEMPLE OF BESAKIH, AND

EVERY HUNDRED YEARS THEY HAVE HELD A SOLEMN RITE THERE TO RID THE

WARNING . ONLY LAST MONTH, AFTER MORE THAN 100 YEARS OF INACTIVITY, IT

BURST FORTH WITH A SHOWER OF SMOKE AND BRIMSTONE THAT KILLED 17 PERSONS

. THERE WAS WORRIED TALK ON BALI THAT THE GODS WERE ANGRY BECAUSE THE

PEOPLE HAD NOT ASKED PERMISSION TO HOLD THEIR FESTIVAL . BUT THE

PRIESTS AND THEIR DISCIPLES STAYED ON TO PRAY . AT 7 O'CLOCK ONE

MORNING, AGUNG ERUPTED AGAIN . THE VILLAGES OF SEBUDI, SORGAH, AND

SEBIH WERE ENGULFED BY A LETHAL BLACK CLOUD OF SEARING, 230O ASH THAT

ROASTED HUNDREDS WHERE THEY KNELT . RIVERS OF GREY-BLACK LAVA BOILED

OVER AGUN'S SOUTHERN LIP AND FLOWED IN FIERY RIVULETS DOWN STREAM BEDS,

RAISING CLOUDS OF STEAM ; HEAVY RAINS, POSSIBLY CAUSED BY THE HEAT OF

THE VOLCANO, MIXED WITH THE SULPHUROUS ASH TO FORM AN ACID THAT KILLED

PLANT LIFE FOR FIVE MILES AROUND . FOR FIVE DAYS AGUNG BELCHED DEATH .

AT WEEK'S END HHE DEATH TOLL STOOD AT CLOSE TO 1,200, AND ANOTHER

200,000 WERE LEFT HOMELESS . AS SURVIVORS STREAMED INTO TOWNS AT THE

BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN, MANY SUFFERING THIRD-DEGREE BURNS FROM A TREK

OVER BEDS OF SMOLDERING ASHES, INDONESIA'S PRESIDENT SUKARNO DECLARED

ALL BALI A DISASTER AREA . THERE WAS LITTLE HOPE THAT AGUNG'S FURY WAS

SOUTH KOREA SQUEEZE IN SEOUL IN SOUTH KOREA LAST WEEK, A FARMER

NAMED SONG KYU IL TRAVELED ALL THE WAY FROM THE SOUTHERN PROVINCES TO

PARADE BEFORE SEOUL'S DUK SOO PALACE WITH A PLACARD SCRAWLED IN HIS OWN

BLOOD : GENERAL PARK, PLEASE DO SOMETHING TO SETTLE THE CRISIS .

FARMER SONG WAS THROWN IN JAIL, ALONG WITH SOME 200 OTHER DEMONSTRATORS

WHO OPENLY PROTESTED SOUTH KOREAN STRONGMAN GENERAL PARK CHUNG HEE'S

BROKEN PROMISE TO CALL GENERAL ELECTIONS IN MAY AND HAND OVER POWER TO

THE CIVILIANS . THE WHOLESALE ARRESTS ONLY SERVED TO ATTRACT MORE

ATTENTION TO THE NOISY CAMPAIGN OF FORMER PRESIDENT YUN PO SUN, 65, AND

NEW RULE PARTY LEADER HUH CHUNG, 67, WHO TOUCHED OFF THE UPROAR WITH A

SERIES OF ANTIGOVERNMENT MEETINGS . JUNTA LEADERS WERE RELUCTANT TO

ARREST YUN AND HUH FOR FEAR THEY WOULD BECOME POLITICAL MARTYRS . BUT

THE MEN AROUND PARK DID NOT HESITATE TO REJECT THE OPPOSITION DEMANDS .

DEFENSE MINISTER KIM SUNG UN SUMMONED 160 TOP MILITARY MEN TO SEOUL FOR

A STRATEGY MEETING, LATER TOOK TO A NATIONWIDE RADIO HOOKUP TO SPEAK

FOR THEM : " WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT . THERE ARE

SEEDS OF UNEASINESS IN THE COUNTRY, AND THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO

TRANSFER THE GOVERNMENT TO CIVILIANS . " THEN, TO MAKE THE POINT MORE

EMPHATICALLY, ALL 160 OFFICERS RODE GRANDLY THROUGH THE STREETS OF

SEOUL IN A CONVOY OF MILITARY JEEPS . IT WAS GENERAL PARK HIMSELF WHO

FELT THE SQUEEZE, FOR HE WAS LESS INTERESTED THAN THE REST OF HIS JUNTA

IN RETAINING POWER IN THE HANDS OF THE ARMY . BUT HE COULD NOT BOW TO

THE CLAMORING CIVILIANS, OR EVEN TO THE PRESSURE APPLIED FROM

WASHINGTON BY U.S . AMBASSADOR SAMUEL BERGER LAST WEEK . FOR IF HE

REVERSED HIMSELF YET ANOTHER TIME TO SUPPORT THE CIVILIANS, A MILITARY

COUP MIGHT WELL TOPPLE HIM OVERNIGHT .

A TOUGH ROW TO HOE WHEN HE WAS NAMED COMMUNIST PARTY BOSS IN THE

PROBLEM-PLAGUED VIRGIN LANDS OF KAZAHKSTAN (TIME, JAN . 4) . BUT HE

COULD HARDLY HAVE GUESSED THE EXTENT OF THE MESS HE WOULD INHERIT FROM

HIS PURGED PREDECESSOR . LAST WEEK YUSUPOV PUBLISHED A REPORT CHARGING

THAT MORE THAN $600 MILLION HAD BEEN WASTED DURING THE LAST THREE YEARS

ON ILLCONCEIVED PROJECTS ; NO FEWER THAN 16,139 REGIONAL OFFICIALS

WERE FIRED LAST YEAR ALONE, 2,340 OF THEM FOR STEALING AND EMBEZZLING

$1,270,000 . A GANG OF CROOKS LED BY THE CHIEF OF THE TSELINOGRAD TRADE

BOARD FAKED REPORTS, RIGGED PHONY PRICES, AND SOLD MEAT, BUTTER AND

AUTOMOBILES ON THE BLACK MARKET ; IN PAVLODAR, THREE MEN MANAGED TO

MAKE OFF WITH NO FEWER THAN 300,000 BOTTLES OF WINE AND VODKA . THE

ENTIRE PARTY AND GOVERNMENT LEADERSHIP OF THE KZYL ORDA REGION

MASTERMINDED A RING OF CATTLE RUSTLERS ; THE LOCAL COMMUNIST CHIEF

ORGANIZED BLACKJACK GAMES AND SET OFF AN " EPIDEMIC OF GAMBLING . "

DAILY MAIL ONE MORNING LAST WEEK . AFTER THE BITTEREST WINTER IN 50

YEARS, DAFFODILS WERE BLOOMING IN LONDON'S PARKS, AND GOVERNMENT

OFFICIALS REPORTED WITH RELIEF THAT THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAD DROPPED,

FROM 3.9 PER CENT TO 3.1 PER CENT , FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN

SIX MONTHS . THEIR JUBILATION WAS SHORT-LIVED . IN A RITE OF SPRING

SUCH AS BRITAIN HAS NOT WITNESSED SINCE THE DEPRESSION, MORE THAN 5,000

JOBLESS WORKERS CONVERGED ON LONDON TO PROTEST THEIR PLIGHT, TOUCHING

OFF AN UGLY, ROCK-THROWING BATTLE AT THE VERY DOOR OF PARLIAMENT .

RAISING THE FLAG . IT ALL BEGAN PEACEFULLY ENOUGH WITH A BANNER-WAVING

PARADE TOWARD WESTMINSTER, WHERE WORKERS' LEADERS WERE DETERMINED TO

CARRY PERSONAL PROTESTS TO THEIR M.P.S . AWKWARDLY AT FIRST, MANY

FINGERING THE CLOTH CAPS THAT ARE THE TRADITIONAL BADGE OF THE BRITISH

WORKINGMAN, THEY STOOD TALKING UNTIL THE HOUSE OF COMMONS' BIG CENTRAL

LOBBY WAS JAMMED, WHILE A SURGING MOB OF WORKERS STILL OUTSIDE JOSTLED

IMPATIENTLY TO GET THROUGH ST . STEPHEN'S DOORWAY . WHEN 500 HASTILY

SUMMONED FOOT AND MOUNTED POLICE TRIED TO FORCE THEM BACK, THE PROTEST

DEMONSTRATION EXPLODED INTO A SAVAGE, THREE-HOUR MELEE PROVOKED PARTLY

BY COMMUNISTS IN THE CROWD . CRYING " FASCISTS " AND " GESTAPO, " THE

WORKERS DROPPED LIGHTED CIGARETTES INTO POLICE HORSES' MOUTHS, TRIED TO

DRAG THE COPS FROM THEIR MOUNTS, HURLED HORSE MANURE AT THEM . SOME

YOUNG WORKERS CLIMBED ONTO THE STONE FIGURES AROUND THE ENTRANCE, AND

ONE COMMUNIST AGITATOR EVEN HAULED UP A RED FLAG . WHEN A POLICE CORDON

FORCED THEM AWAY FROM THE BUILDINGS AFTER SIX CHARGES, HUNDREDS OF

DEMONSTRATORS STAGED A SITDOWN STRIKE IN THE ROAD . THE CROWD INCLUDED

KILTED SCOTSMEN AND OLD-AGE PENSIONERS, APPRENTICES, MILL GIRLS AND

GRIZZLED STEELWORKERS . MOST CAME FROM THE NORTHERN SHIPBUILDING AND

STEELMAKING CITIES OF ENGLAND, SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND, WHERE THE

MISERY OF THE 1930S IS NOT FORGOTTEN . LAST WEEK, BY CONTRAST WITH THE

HUNGER MARCHES OF THAT ERA, MOST ARRIVED BY TRAIN OR BUS ; SOME EVEN

CAME BY PLANE . SAID A SCOTTISH MINER : " WE ARE NOT HUNGRY MEN ASKING

EMPLOYMENT IN HOMEBUILDING AND HEAVY CONSTRUCTION, THE ACTUAL TOTAL OF

PREVIOUS MARCH, AND WAS ACTUALLY RISING IN THE WORST-HIT NORTHERN AREAS

RETURN TO HEADQUARTERS TO REPORT THAT GEORGES BIDAULT, 63, FORMER

PREMIER OF FRANCE AND NOW SELF-STYLED OPERATIONAL CHIEF OF THE

TERRORIST SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION, HAD LEFT WEST GERMANY . FOR THE

FIRST TIME SINCE BIDAULT WAS TRACED TO HIS HIDEAWAY IN A RURAL VILLA

A SUBURBAN LISBON VILLA . HE WAS EXPECTED TO SEEK REFUGE IN SOUTH

AMERICA . DRIFTING AIMLESSLY LIKE A MAN WITHOUT A COUNTRY, BIDAULT

FROM THE PACIFIC TO THE ELBE WAS THE SECOND BIGGEST TOPIC IN EUROPEAN

CAPITALS LAST WEEK . FOR MONTHS, NATO HAS BEEN URGING A TOTAL EMBARGO

DEFEAT ONLY BY ORDERING HIS CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS TO STAY OFF THE FLOOR,

CALLED THE BUNDESTAG BOYCOTT DIRTY POOL ; THE INDUSTRIALISTS

COMPLAINED MORE BITTERLY THAN EVER . THERE THE ISSUE COULD HAVE

SIMMERED INDEFINITELY ; BUT LAST WEEK THE BRITISH CALMLY ANNOUNCED

THAT, SINCE THEY HAD NEVER SUPPORTED NATO'S PIPE EMBARGO IN THE FIRST

PLACE, THE GOVERNMENT HAD NO OBJECTION IF A BRITISH FIRM ACCEPTED A

SOVIET DEAL FOR PIPE THAT BONN HAD JUST CANCELED . THAT ONLY ONE

BRITISH COMPANY WAS TECHNICALLY EQUIPPED TO TURN OUT SMALL AMOUNTS OF

LARGE-DIAMETER PIPE AND HAD NOT EVEN RECEIVED A BID FROM MOSCOW WAS OF

SMALL COMFORT TO U.S . AND WEST GERMAN OFFICIALS . NOR WERE THEY

REASSURED BY THE FACT THAT ITALY, A MAJOR SUPPLIER OF SOVIET PIPE

BEFORE THE NATO BAN, DID NOT IMMEDIATELY GRAB OFF PART OF THE LUCRATIVE

TRADE ; ITALIAN MANUFACTURERS SIMPLY WERE BACKED UP AT THE MOMENT WITH

THEIR OWN DOMESTIC ORDERS . WHAT REALLY HAD WASHINGTON AND BONN

CONCERNED WAS LONDON'S NEXT MOVE . BRITAIN, EXCLUDED FOR NOW FROM THE

COMMON MARKET AND PLAGUED BY SERIOUS UNEMPLOYMENT, WAS EAGER FOR EXPORT

MARKETS ANYWHERE ; IF ONE INCH OF LARGE-DIAMETER OIL PIPE WAS

DELIVERED TO RUSSIA, THE NATO BOYCOTT WOULD BE BROKEN . WEST GERMANY

AND ITALY COULD NO LONGER BE RESTRAINED . NEITHER COULD FRANCE, WHICH

HAS A MASSIVE (500,000 TONS), AND MOSTLY UNUSED, ANNUAL CAPACITY FOR

PARTY PUTZFRAU (CHARWOMAN) IN A GOVERNMENT BUILDING, THERE MUST BE A

THE MEAGER VICTORY OF THE PEOPLE'S PARTY 81 SEATS TO 76 FOR THE

SOCIALISTS WAS HARDLY A MANDATE FOR SWEEPING CHANGE . STILL,

CONSERVATIVE CHANCELLOR ALFONS GORBACH SHARED THE REFORMERS' FEELING

THAT THE EXTRA STRENGTH ENTITLED HIS PARTY TO AT LEAST ONE MORE

MINISTRY . THE ONE IN MIND : THE FOREIGN MINISTRY, WHERE SOCIALIST

BRUNO KREISKY WAS THE PRIME TARGET OF THE PEOPLE'S PARTY REFORMERS .

THE CONSERVATIVES ARGUED THAT A SOCIALIST COULD NOT POSSIBLY PUT HIS

HEART INTO THE VITAL NEGOTIATIONS FOR AUSTRIAN ASSOCIATE MEMBERSHIP IN

TODAY IS ENGAGED IN NOT ONE, BUT TWO NUCLEAR ARMS RACES . ITS FIRST AND

OVERRIDING CONCERN, OF COURSE, IS TO DETER SOVIET AGGRESSION AND TO BE

CAPABLE OF MASSIVE RETALIATION IF THE RUSSIANS SHOULD ATTACK THE WEST .

WASHINGTON'S SECOND AIM, HOWEVER, IS LESS STRATEGIC THAN POLITICAL ;

IT COULD BE CALLED THE THEORY OF THE MASSIVE PLACEBO, SINCE ITS PRIMARY

PURPOSE IS NOT TO DETER THE FOES OF THE U.S . BUT TO MOLLIFY ITS

FRIENDS AND DISCOURAGE THE PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR ARMS . BY LAST

WEEK, U.S . PLACEBO PLANNERS HAD SUCCEEDED ONLY IN FRUSTRATING AND

PERPLEXING THE VERY ALLIES THEY HOPED TO PLEASE . UNEASILY AWARE THAT

THE INCREASINGLY PROSPEROUS AND POWERFUL NATIONS OF WESTERN EUROPE

WOULD NOT FOREVER ACCEPT TOTAL U.S . CONTROL OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS, THE

U.S . OFFERED MORE THAN TWO YEARS AGO TO GIVE THEM A VOICE IN THEIR

DISPOSITION AND USE BUT LEFT IT TO EUROPE TO DEVISE A FORMULA . IT WAS

NOT UNTIL THE KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION CANCELED THE BUG-RIDDEN SKYBOLT

MISSILE PROJECT LAST DECEMBER THAT THE U.S . WAS FORCED TO TAKE THE

INITIATIVE . IN PLACE OF SKYBOLT, THE ADMINISTRATION RELUCTANTLY

OFFERED AT NASSAU TO SUPPLY POLARIS MISSILES FOR AN INDEPENDENT BRITISH

SUBMARINE FORCE . CHANGE OF MIND . AT THE SAME TIME, THE U.S . INSISTED

THAT THE BRITISH SUBS MUST BE " MULTINATIONAL, " THAT IS, THEY WERE TO

BE PART OF A NATO DETERRENT IN WHICH OTHER ALLIES MIGHT IN TIME POOL

THEIR OWN STRIKE FORCES, IF AND WHEN THEY ACQUIRED NUCLEAR WEAPONS . TO

PLACATE ITS OTHER EUROPEAN ALLIES, THE KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION ALSO

PROPOSED A " MULTILATERAL " FORCE OF POLARIS SUBMARINES, WHICH WOULD BE

MULTIMANNED AND MULTIFINANCED BY THE U.S . AND ITS PARTNERS, EACH OF

WHOM WOULD HAVE A VETO OVER THE USE OF THE MISSILES . THEN, JUST AS THE

EUROPEANS BEGAN TO GET INTERESTED IN THIS SCHEME, THE U.S . ABRUPTLY

CHANGED ITS MIND AND ANNOUNCED THAT THE MULTILATERAL FORCE (MLF) SHOULD

CONSIST OF POLARIS-ARMED SURFACE VESSELS INSTEAD THOUGH IT WOULD BE

LITTLE STRATEGIC VALUE, A 25-SHIP SURFACE FORCE WOULD COST ONLY $500

MILLION YEARLY, FAR LESS THAN A SUBMARINE FLEET . TO MOST EUROPEANS,

THE STRONGEST ARGUMENT FOR THE MLF WAS THAT IT WOULD GIVE WEST GERMANY

A VOICE IN NUCLEAR STRATEGY AND POSSIBLY DISCOURAGE IT FROM DEVELOPING

NUCLEAR WEAPONS OF ITS OWN, WITH OR WITHOUT HELP FROM FRANCE FRANKLY

INTERESTED . TO PEDDLE THE PLACEBO, THE ADMINISTRATION PLUCKED OLD

STATE DEPARTMENT HAND LIVINGSTON MERCHANT FROM RETIREMENT . TO HIS

SURPRISE, MLF MET WITH A SURPRISINGLY WARM RECEPTION . THOUGH SOME

ALLIED STATESMEN HEMMED THAT ITS COST WOULD PREVENT THEM FROM MEETING

U.S . REQUESTS TO STRENGTHEN CONVENTIONAL FORCES, WEST GERMANY, ITALY

AND BELGIUM WERE FRANKLY INTERESTED . LAST MONTH MERCHANT ACTUALLY

SUCCEEDED IN EXTRACTING A COMMITMENT FROM WEST GERMANY TO PAY 40 PER

CENT OF THE ENTIRE COST OF THE PROJECT . HOWEVER, LAST WEEK, WORD

REACHED NATO HEADQUARTERS IN PARIS THAT WASHINGTON HAD SUDDENLY LOST

ITS ENTHUSIASM FOR THE MULTILATERAL FORCE . ITS CHANGE OF MIND NOT ONLY

LEFT UNSOLVED THE POLITICAL PROBLEMS THAT MLF WAS DEVISED TO SOLVE, BUT

EVEN SEEMED LIKELY TO AGGRAVATE THEM, SINCE THE U.S . WAS NOW

REPORTEDLY READY TO BACK THE IDEA OF INDEPENDENT MULTINATIONAL FORCES

INSTEAD, THUS ENCOURAGING ITS ALLIES TO BUILD THEIR OWN BOMBS . EVEN IF

EVERY NATO ALLY COULD AFFORD ITS OWN NUCLEAR FORCE AND A SCIENTIFIC

BREAKTHROUGH MAY YET MAKE THAT FEASIBLE EUROPE WOULD HAVE ONLY A MINUTE

PROPORTION OF THE TOTAL U.S . NUCLEAR ARMORY . BUT WHO CAN PREDICT HOW

IT WILL TURN OUT ? IN THE BRAVE NEW WORLD OF BUILD-YOUR-OWN-BANG, IT

COMMODITY IN THE MIDDLE EAST THE LURE OF ARAB UNITY . A 14-MAN ALGERIAN

DELEGATION, HEADED BY DEFENSE MINISTER HOUARI BOUMEDIENNE SHOWED UP IN

CAIRO TO PAY ITS RESPECTS . " REGARDING ARAB UNITY, " SAID BOUMEDIENNE,

/ OUR OBJECTIVE SHOULD BE THE CREATION OF SOLID, STRONG AND HEALTHY

BASES . THE ARAB PEOPLE ARE NOT READY TO ACCEPT ANOTHER SETBACK,

ANOTHER LETDOWN . FOR THAT REASON, ALL STEPS TOWARD ARAB UNITY MUST BE

ABSOLUTELY UNSHAKEABLE . " NASSER AGREED COMPLETELY . " WE REFUSE, IF

ANYBODY ASKS US, " HE SAID, " TO FORM A NOMINAL UNION FOR OUTWARD

APPEARANCES . " LATER, HE FERVENTLY TOLD A SYRIAN DELEGATION HEADED BY

BAATH PARTY LEADERS MICHEL AFLAK AND SALAH EL-BITAR : " WE BELIEVE THE

TIDE OF REVOLUTIONARY UNION IN THIS GENERATION IS A HISTORIC

OPPORTUNITY WHICH WILL NOT REPEAT ITSELF . " HE ALSO SUGGESTED THAT THE

BAATHISTS BROADEN THEIR NEW SYRIAN GOVERNMENT TO BRING IN POPULAR THAT

IS, NASSERITE ELEMENTS . " MAN OF CRISES . " HE GOT FAST RESULTS .

WITHIN THREE DAYS, PRO-NASSER LIEUT . GENERAL LOUAI ATTASSI WAS NAMED

PRESIDENT OF THE SYRIAN COUNCIL OF THE REVOLUTIONARY COMMAND, AND THE

COUNCIL ITSELF WAS ENLARGED TO ADMIT A NASSERITE MAJORITY . ATTASSI

PREDICTED THAT UNION WITH EGYPT AND IRAQ WOULD BE ACHIEVED " SHORTLY, "

CLAIMING, " THIS TRIPARTITE FEDERATION WILL SPREAD AND SPREAD UNTIL THE

ENTIRE ARAB WORLD FROM THE ATLANTIC OCEAN TO THE PERSIAN GULF IS

UNIFIED IN ONE POWERFUL STATE, WEIGHING HEAVILY IN THE BALANCE OF WORLD

POWER . " EVEN ONE OF NASSER'S ENEMIES IN THE ARAB WORLD THE HASHEMITE

KINGDOM OF JORDAN SHOWED SIGNS LAST WEEK OF BEING DISCREETLY AVAILABLE

RIFAI AGREED ON A NEW GOVERNMENT, LOOKING TOWARD PARLIAMENTARY

DEMOCRACY AND HUSSEIN'S EVENTUAL RETIREMENT TO THE FIGUREHEAD ROLE OF A

CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCH . THEY EVEN GINGERLY ACCEPTED THE NASSER-BAATH

SLOGAN OF " FREEDOM, UNITY, SOCIALISM, " WITH ONLY THE SLIGHT AMENDMENT

OF THE FINAL WORD TO READ " A BETTER LIFE . " WHAT WAS STILL UNCERTAIN

LAST WEEK WAS WHETHER NASSER IS PREPARED TO DROP OR MODIFY HIS PRESENT

DETERMINATION TO UNITE ONLY WITH " LIBERATED " ARAB STATES AND TO SHUN

MONARCHIES . SAID NEW JORDANIAN PRIME MINISTER RIFAI : " WE HAVE OUR

PRIDE . WE ARE JUST AS HEALTHY AND STRONG AS ANY ARAB STATE . WE DON'T

INTEND TO RUSH INTO ANYTHING, BUT WE DO INTEND TO PROCLAIM OUR GOOD

WILL AND OUR ATTACHMENT TO ARAB UNITY . " THEN HE ADDED HOPEFULLY, "

THERE'S EVERY REASON FOR THE NEW ARAB UNION TO WELCOME JORDAN AND NO

REASON TO BAR A CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY . WE HAVE MORE FREEDOM THAN

MANY REPUBLICS . WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE ANYWAY BETWEEN A CONSTITUTIONAL

MOROCCO A FRIEND IN WASHINGTON IN WASHINGTON'S UNION STATION LAST

WEEK, THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD'S ANCIENT PRIVATE CAR NO . 1750 CAME TO

A HESITANT STOP . CLEARLY UNCERTAIN OF THE ENGINEER'S INTENTIONS, KING

HASSAN II OF MOROCCO DESCENDED CAUTIOUSLY TO THE PLATFORM, THEN

DISPLAYED A BIG, ENGAGING SMILE AS HE SHOOK HANDS WITH PRESIDENT

KENNEDY, AND TURNED WITH EVEN MORE WARMTH TO JACKIE KENNEDY, SMARTLY

CLAD IN A SPRING DRESS AND COAT, AND DARK BLUE STRAW HAT . LOVELY RIVAL

. KING HASSAN EVEN PRODUCED A RIVAL FOR JACKIE IN HIS LOVELY SISTER,

PRINCESS LALLA NEZHA, 22, WHO WAS GREETED WITH A BOUQUET OF RED ROSES .

ALL THE PROPER PROTOCOL WAS LAID ON, FROM A 50-YD . RED CARPET TO AN

HONOR GUARD . " WE ARE PROUD TO WELCOME YOU, YOUR MAJESTY, " SAID THE

PRESIDENT TO THE KING . " YOUR COUNTRY WAS THE FIRST TO RECOGNIZE THE

U.S . IN THE MOST DIFFICULT DAYS OF OUR REVOLUTION . "  KING HASSAN

RESPONDED BY SAYING THAT HE HAD COME TO THE U.S . " TO RENEW MY

ACQUAINTANCE WITH YOUR PEOPLE, TO MEET YOU AND YOUR GOVERNMENT . "

THIRTY-THREE-YEAR-OLD KING HASSAN ALSO BROUGHT WITH HIM CRATES OF GIFTS

; BUT LEFT BEHIND IN RABAT WAS A SMALL, SHINY GREY HORSE WITH THE

MOROCCAN COLORS OF RED AND GREEN PLAITED IN ITS MANE, WHICH HAD BEEN

INTENDED FOR CAROLINE . THE STATE DEPARTMENT WAS COURTEOUSLY ADAMANT :

NO MORE HORSES FOR THE WHITE HOUSE . KING HASSAN CHOSE THE U.S . FOR

HIS FIRST STATE VISIT OUTSIDE AFRICA TO DEMONSTRATE THAT MOROCCO,

THOUGH OFFICIALLY UNALIGNED, KNOWS THAT ITS REAL INTEREST LIES WITH THE

WEST . INDEED, IN THE TWO YEARS SINCE HIS FATHER DIED, HASSAN HAS

PROVED TO BE A SENSIBLE LEADER OF MOROCCO'S 11.6 MILLION PEOPLE . THREE

LOVELY DAYS . BETWEEN BANQUETS AND RECEPTIONS, THE KING AND THE

PRESIDENT GOT TO KNOW AND LIKE EACH OTHER . HASSAN EVEN CANCELED A

SCHEDULED VISIT TO THE NAVAL ACADEMY AT ANNAPOLIS IN ORDER TO HAVE

ADDITIONAL TALKS WITH KENNEDY . THEIR CONVERSATION RANGED OVER MANY

WORLD PROBLEMS, FROM MIDDLE EAST TENSIONS TO CUBA, TO NATO . THERE WAS

ALSO QUIET AFFIRMATION OF DECISIONS ALREADY TAKEN, INCLUDING THE U.S .

PLEDGE TO EVACUATE THREE BIG SAC AIRFIELDS AND A NAVAL BASE IN MOROCCO

BY YEAR'S END, AND TO CONTINUE AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT OF FINANCIAL AID

TO HASSAN'S KINGDOM (LAST YEAR'S TOTAL : $30 MILLION) . KING HASSAN

WAS IMPRESSED BY HIS HOSPITABLE RECEPTION, WHICH INCLUDED SPECIAL

ENTERTAINMENT AT THE WHITE HOUSE (SCENES FROM BRIGADOON), AN UNUSUAL

WELCOME FROM 100,000 WASHINGTONIANS LINING THE STREETS, AND THREE OF

THE LOVELIEST SPRING DAYS IN WASHINGTON MEMORY . THE STATE DEPARTMENT

LIKED THE INGELLIGENCE AND COMPETENCE DISPLAYED BY KING HASSAN

THROUGHOUT THE SESSIONS, HIS SERIOUS PREOCCUPATION WITH HIS OWN REGION

OF NORTH AFRICA, HIS JUDICIOUS COMMENT THAT MOROCCO WOULD JOIN AN ARAB

UNION HEADED BY EGYPT'S NASSER ONLY AFTER CAREFUL STUDY HAD SHOWN SUCH

UNION TO BE " IN THE COMMON GOOD . " THE WASHINGTON CONSENSUS : KING

HASSAN IS A " MODERN REFORMIST " IN THE TRADITION OF THE SHAH OF IRAN .

1776, FRANCE WAS SECRETLY AIDING THE INFANT U.S . AGAINST BRITAIN WITH

MONEY AND MUNITIONS . EARLY IN 1778, THE SULTAN OF MOROCCO IMPETUOUSLY

INONU FINALLY LET HIS OLD ENEMY EX-PRESIDENT CELAL BAYAR OUT OF JAIL

FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT FORTNIGHT AGO, HE FIGURED THE LEAST HE SHOULD GET

WAS A LITTLE GRATITUDE FROM THE OPPOSITION JUSTICE PARTY . INSTEAD,

BAYARY SUPPORTERS TURNED THE OCCASION INTO A WEEK-LONG POLITICAL

DEMONSTRATION AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT . FIVE HUNDRED AUTOS FILLED WITH

JUSTICE PARTY FOLLOWERS FORMED A TRAFFIC-SNARLING MOTORCADE TO ESCORT

THE 79-YEAR-OLD BAYAR FROM PRISON TO HIS ANKARA HOME . NEXT DAY, HUGE

CROWDS MILLED AROUND THE HOUSE, AND 10,000 SUPPORTERS MASSED NEAR

PARLIAMENT TO SHOUT HIS SLOGANS . TWO SYMPATHETIC TURKISH AIR FORCE

PILOTS HAPPILY BUZZED THE CITY IN THEIR JETS . GROWING ANGRY AND A BIT

NERVOUS OVER THE POPULAR DEMONSTRATION, THE ARMY OFFICERS WHO RUN

TURKEY FROM BEHIND THE SCENES LOCKED UP ONE BATCH OF EXULTANT BAYAR MEN

WHO STOPPED THEIR BUS IN FRONT OF THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND " MADE

SIGNS AGAINST THE ARMY, " THEN ISSUED AN ANNOUNCEMENT WARNING THAT THE

/ EVENTS THREATEN NATIONAL UNITY . " AT THIS SIGNAL, PRO-GOVERNMENT

DEMONSTRATORS THEMSELVES TOOK TO THE STREETS YELLING " BAYAR, BACK TO

COPS TRIED TO PREVENT A BLOODY CLASH BY OPENING BOTH PONTOON BRIDGES

TEARFULLY, HE EMBRACED THE SON OF THE LATE PREMIER ADNAN MENDERES,

BAYAR'S COLLEAGUE WHO WAS SENT TO THE GALLOWS BY THE YASSIADA TRIBUNAL

. THROUGHOUT IT ALL, PREMIER INONU PERFORMED A CLASSIC SLOW BURN,

LETTING THE JUSTICE CROWD HAVE ITS FUN FOR SIX DAYS . AT LAST, THE

EXASPERATED AUTHORITIES COULD TAKE NO MORE, SENT BAYAR OFF TO A

HOSPITAL . JUST A PHYSICAL EXAMINATION, THE COPS ASSURED THE OLD MAN,

WHO PROMPTLY WENT ON A HUNGER STRIKE . A GUARD WAS PUT ON THE DOOR OF

NYASALAND SIR EDGAR & THE ELDERS ONE DAY IN MARCH 1959, IN THE

BRITISH CENTRAL AFRICA PROTECTORATE OF NYASALAND, HARMLESS-LOOKING

ELARD CHIPANDALE, 31, TIED A HANDFUL OF MAGIC TWIGS ABOUT HIS WAIST,

DONNED A COAT OF TREE BARK, AND TURNED HIMSELF INTO A CROCODILE . HE

LAY IN WAIT BY THE BANK OF THE MWANZA RIVER FOR AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD GIRL

NAMED MPONDA SIMENTI . WHEN MPONDA AMBLED BY ON THE WAY TO FETCH WATER

FOR HER FAMILY, ELARD THE CROCODILE DRAGGED HER INTO THE RIVER, BROKE

HER ARM WITH HIS LASHING TAIL, AND FINISHED HER OFF WITH HIS

FINGER-LONG TEETH . THIS WAS ELARD'S OWN MYSTICAL VERSION OF WHAT SOME

MIGHT CONSIDER MERELY A CASE OF MURDER FOR PAY . THE GIRL'S

GRANDFATHER, ODRECK KASOCI, HAD SOUGHT OUT ELARD TO GET RID OF THE

ANNOYING CHILD BECAUSE ELARD WAS WELL KNOWN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AS A "

MAGIC MAN, " AND THEREFORE QUALIFIED TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM . ODRECK

AGREED TO PAY $13.50 FOR THE ASSASSINATION, BUT WHEN THE DEED WAS DONE,

HE RENEGED . CHIPANDALE SUED IN A NATIVE COURT FOR HIS FEE AND WON .

BUT A GOVERNMENT POLICEMAN HAPPENED IN ON THE PROCEEDINGS AND REPORTED

THE TWO MEN . LAST WEEK, IN NYASALAND'S COMMERCIAL CENTER OF BLANTYRE

BOTH MEN WERE ON TRIAL FOR MURDER . ELARD'S READY ADMISSION OF THE

KILLING DID NOT MAKE THINGS ANY EASIER FOR CHIEF JUSTICE SIR EDGAR

UNSWORTH . FOR ELARD INSISTED THAT HE WAS NOT GUILY BECAUSE HE WAS A

CROCODILE AT THE TIME . SIR EDGAR CALLED IN THE GOVERNMENT'S

PSYCHIATRIST TO TEST ELARD'S SANITY . HE WAS JUDGED NOT INSANE, BUT THE

PSYCHIATRIST ADDED, " WE MUST ADMIT WE ARE DEALING WITH A MENTALITY

COMPLETELY FOREIGN TO US . " SIR EDGAR TURNED TO THE COURT ASSESSORS

THREE TRIBAL ELDERS FOR EXPERT GUIDANCE . " ARE YOU SATISFIED, " HE

ASKED, " THAT THE PROSECUTION HAS ESTABLISHED THAT ELARD WAS NOT, ON

ACCOUNT OF HIS SUPERSTITIOUS BELIEF, UNDER THE DELUSION THAT HE WAS A

CROCODILE ? " THE THREE WERE UNANIMOUS IN THEIR ANSWER : " HE TURNED

HIMSELF INTO A MAGIC CROCODILE AND SEIZED THE CHILD . " SIR EDGAR WAS

FACED WITH ANOTHER CLASSIC CLASH OF WHITE MAN'S RULES WITH DEEPROOTED

AFRICAN BELIEFS . SINCE THE TWO COULD NOT BE RESOLVED, SIR EDGAR WAS

FORCED TO MAKE HIS DECISION ON THE BASIS OF SOCIAL PATTERNS HE COULD

HONEST RAGE AT THE CANT AND CALLOUSNESS OF SOVIET SOCIETY HAS MADE HIM

THE IDOL OF HIS GENERATION . FOR A WHILE, IN FACT, IT SEEMED AS IF

EVTUSHENKO (TIME COVER, APRIL 13, 1962) HAD BECOME A SEMIOFFICIAL ANGRY

YOUNG MARXIST, WHOSE OCCASIONAL EXCESSES WERE TOLERATED BY THE REGIME

BECAUSE THEY MADE IT APPEAR AS IF KHRUSHCHEV'S COMMUNISM COULD ACTUALLY

ACCEPT CRITICISM . IF SO, EVTUSHENKO PUSHED HIS LUCK TOO FAR . VAIN

APOLOGIES . DURING A SWING THROUGH FRANCE AND WEST GERMANY EARLY THIS

YEAR, THE DASHING YOUNG POET WAS LIONIZED AT PARTIES (INCLUDING A

MASQUERADE BALL DURING MUNICH'S ANNUAL CARNIVAL) BY PLEASURE-LOVING

CONFERENCES . HEAPING SCORN ON THE PARTY FOSSILS WHOSE HACKWORK WINS

NOT SAY SO, NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV IS THE DEAN EMERITUS . THE POET'S MOST

GREAT BRITAIN WEEKEND IN WASHINGTON FROM THE SOLICITOUS RECEPTION

HE GOT FROM THE NEW FRONTIER, THE LITTLE COLDEYED MAN WHO STEPPED OFF

THE AIRLINER IN WASHINGTON MIGHT HAVE BEEN BRITAIN'S PRIME MINISTER

RATHER THAN THE OPPOSITION LEADER . EVEN IN HIS OWN LABOR PARTY SIX

MONTHS AGO, PIPE-PUFFING HAROLD WILSON WAS REGARDED AS A SLIPPERY

OPPORTUNIST AND A CONSTANT THREAT TO THE PARTY'S HARDWON UNITY UNDER

THE LATE HUGH GAITSKELL . THOUGH HIS VIEWS ON MOST MAJOR ISSUES WERE

CALCULATEDLY MURKY, " LITTLE HAROLD, " AS HIS FOES CALL HIM, DREW

LEFT-WING SUPPORT BY CONDEMNING U.S . HANDLING OF CUBA, CHEERING ON THE

UNILATERALISTS, BITTERLY OPPOSING BRITAIN'S BID FOR COMMON MARKET

MEMBERSHIP . HOWEVER, IT WAS NOT WILSON'S PAST THAT BROUGHT OUT

WASHINGTON'S RED CARPET BUT HIS POTENTIAL FUTURE . EVEN THOUGH

ELECTIONS WILL PROBABLY NOT BE CALLED FOR AT LEAST A YEAR, NO U.S .

POLICYMAKER COULD IGNORE TODAY'S GALLUP POLLS, WHICH GIVE THE LABOR

PARTY A RECORD 50 PER CENT TO 33F PER CENT LEAD OVER THE TORIES . IF

THAT TREND SHOULD CONTINUE, HAROLD WILSON WOULD BE BRITAIN'S NEXT PRIME

MINISTER . WHAT ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS GOT LAST WEEK WAS AMPLE

DEMONSTRATION OF THE FACT THAT SINCE GAITSKELL'S DEATH, THE FLINTY,

QUICK-WITTED

YORKSHIREMAN HAS HAD TO

MOVE CLOSER TO THE POLITICAL CENTER TO HOLD THE PARTY TOGETHER AND TAKE

HARD AND FAST STANDS ON WHICH BRITAIN'S ELECTORATE CAN WEIGH THE MERITS

OF A LABOR GOVERNMENT . WILSON WAS PLAINLY ANXIOUS TO WIN THE NEW

FRONTIER'S CONFIDENCE . AFTER AN INTENSIVE, FOUR-DAY ROUND OF

CONFERENCES WITH PRESIDENT KENNEDY AND KEY ADMINISTRATIVE HANDS, THE

LABOR LEADER'S VIEWS ON MOST OUTSTANDING WORLD ISSUES SEEMED NOW AT

LEAST AS CLOSE TO U.S . POLICY AS HAROLD MACMILLAN'S . " DENEGOTIATION

. " WILSON'S MOST REASSURING MESSAGE WAS THAT HE UNEQUIVOCALLY SUPPORTS

NATO AS " THE CENTER OF OUR DEFENSE POLICY IN EUROPE . " TO THE DELIGHT

OF THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT, WHICH HAS LONG TRIED IN VAIN TO PERSUADE

BRITAIN TO BUILD UP ITS CHRONICALLY INADEQUATE GROUND FORCES ON THE

CONTINENT, WILSON ARGUED THAT BRITAIN COULD WELL AFFORD A STRONG ARMY

IF, AS HE PROPOSES, IT WERE TO ELIMINATE ITS NUCLEAR STRIKE FORCE " THE

SOCALLED INDEPENDENT, SO-CALLED BRITISH, SOCALLED DETERRENT . " THUS,

IF ELECTED, WILSON WOULD " DENEGOTIATE " BRITAIN'S AGREEMENT AT NASSAU

TO BUILD A POLARIS SUBMARINE FLEET, AND HOPE THEREBY TO DISCOURAGE

OTHER NATIONS FROM BUILDING INDEPENDENT DETERRENTS . HE IS STRONGLY

OPPOSED TO GIVING GERMANY A FINGER ON THE TRIGGER, WHICH " WOULD BE

HIGHLY PROVOCATIVE TO THE SOVIET UNION AND MAKE IT EVEN HARDER TO GET

AGREEMENTS, " PARTICULARLY ON THE MATTER OF DISARMAMENT . BELYING

REPORTS THAT HE WAS " SOFT " ON WEST BERLIN, WILSON INSISTED THAT IT

MUST REMAIN A FREE AND VIABLE CITY, AND THAT ALLIED TROOPS WOULD HAVE

TO BE STATIONED THERE " FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE . " RESERVATIONS .

THERE WERE SOME ISSUES ON WHICH WILSON'S VIEWS WERE DIRECTLY AT ODDS

WITH THOSE OF THE ADMINISTRATION ; U.S . OFFICIALS WERE INCLINED TO

SHRUG THEM OFF AS LIP SERVICE TO LABOR'S LEFT WING . MOST IMPORTANT

DIVERGENCE IS HIS SUPPORT FOR WITHDRAWAL OF NATO AND SOVIET TROOPS FROM

CENTRAL EUROPE, MAKING " NUCLEAR-FREE " ZONES OF EAST AND WEST GERMANY

AND HUNGARY A PROPOSAL THAT THE U.S . CONSIDERS IMPRACTICAL AND

DANGEROUS . WILSON SEEMED AS WOBBLY AS EVER ON SOME QUESTIONS, NOTABLY

THE COMMON MARKET, WHICH HE NOW CONDITIONALLY FAVORS . HE SUPPORTS

GREATER EAST-WEST TRADE, WHICH IS NOT AN ADMINISTRATION GOAL, AND

FAVORS SEATING COMMUNIST CHINA IN THE U.N., WHICH IS DIRECTLY CONTRARY

TO U.S . POLICY, BUT HE TOLD U.S . OFFICIALS THAT THESE ARE NOT

HIGH-PRIORITY AIMS . THESE VIEWS GAVE REASON FOR CONTINUED RESERVATIONS

ABOUT HAROLD WILSON . MOREOVER, THOUGH HIS INCISIVE, PRAGMATIC STYLE

UNDENIABLY IMPRESSED WASHINGTON, OLDER HEADS HAVE STILL TO BE PERSUADED

THAT WILSON'S CONVICTIONS WILL NOT SHIFT AGAIN AS THEY HAVE SO MANY

TIMES BEFORE .

SLOGANS, " THUNDERED GAULLIST MINISTER FRANCOIS MISSOFFE LAST WEEK, "

THE UNIONS WILL SUFFER THE SAME FATE AS THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND BE

DEMOLISHED . " BUT THINGS DID NOT WORK OUT QUITE THAT WAY . IN FRANCE'S

NORTHERN COAL FIELDS, 188,000 MINERS WORE SMILES OF VICTORY AS THEY

TROOPED BACK TO THE PITS AFTER THEIR BITTER 35-DAY STRIKE . DEFYING A

GOVERNMENT ANTISTRIKE DECREE THAT COULD HAVE RESULTED IN FINES, FIRINGS

AND JAIL TERMS, THE MINERS HAD WON AN IMMEDIATE 6.5 PER CENT PAY BOOST

THAT WILL RISE TO 12.5 PER CENT BY NEXT APRIL . THE HUMILIATING DEFEAT

FOR PRESIDENT CHARLES DE GAULLE ADDED NO LUSTER TO HIS POPULAR PRESTIGE

. CITING AN " EVIDENT CORRELATION " BETWEEN DE GAULLE'S SAGGING CURVE

AND THE STRIKE, THE FRENCH INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC OPINION SAID THAT ONLY

42 PER CENT OF THE PUBLIC WAS CURRENTLY " SATISFIED " WITH HIS

HANDLING OF THE PRESIDENCY, COMPARED WITH 55 PER CENT IN MARCH AND 64

PER CENT IN JANUARY . BUT MORE IMPORTANT TO DE GAULLE THAN POPULARITY

WAS HIS FEAR OF THE STRIKE'S ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE ECONOMY . THE WAGE

GAINS BY MINERS HAVE ALREADY TOUCHED OFF SIMILAR DEMANDS BY OTHER

WORKERS IN NATIONALIZED INDUSTRY ; WHEN PRIVATE EMPLOYEES START

BARGAINING FOR A FRESH ROUND OF SALARY HIKES, THE RESULT COULD BE AS

PREMIER GEORGES POMPIDOU HAS PUT IT " A CERTAIN MALADY WHICH IS CALLED

KONRAD ADENAUER'S CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS HAD WON A MAJORITY AMONG THE

COUNTRY ; A RECENT PUBLIC-OPINION POLL SHOWED THAT HE IS REGARDED BY

25 PER CENT OF THE VOTERS AS THE BEST MAN TO SUCCEED ADENAUER, WHEREAS

SOCIALIST LEADER WILLY BRANDT IS FAVORED BY ONLY 12 PER CENT . BUT WITH

FEDERAL ELECTIONS ONLY TWO YEARS AWAY, 32 PER CENT OF THOSE POLLED NOW

LOOK ON THE SOCIALISTS AS THE " MOST SYMPATHETIC PARTY, " WHILE ONLY 30

PER CENT SO REGARD THE C.D.U . A THREEMAN C.D.U . COMMITTEE CHOSEN TO

NAME THE NEXT CHANCELLOR APPEARS CONVINCED THAT ONLY ERHARD CAN REVERSE

THE TIDE . BUT ADENAUER HOLDS OUT AGAINST A QUICK DECISION . FOR THE

PROBLEM OF COMMUNIST DOMINATION . BUT SINGAPORE HAS THE MOST

POWERFUL MILITARY INSTALLATIONS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, WILL BE THE HOME

SPEAKING, THIS IS NOT TRUE ; THE IDEA HAS LONG BEEN THE DREAM OF ASIAN

WAY TO TIE UP ALL ITS REMAINING ASIAN COLONIES (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF

HONG KONG) INTO ONE TIDY INDEPENDENT PACKAGE . BUT THE TUNKU (IT MEANS

COUNTRIES INTO THE FEDERATION AGREEMENT, WAS THE ONLY LOGICAL CHOICE TO

SERVE AS THE NEW NATION'S FIRST PRIME MINISTER . HAPPY, NOT MIGHTY .

UNLIKE MOST OTHER NEW ASIAN LEADERS, ABDUL RAHMAN IS NO RABID

NATIONALIST . HE HAS REMAINED ON CLOSE, FRIENDLY TERMS WITH THE

BRITISH, HAS NO INTEREST IN PIE-IN-THE-SKY ECONOMIC SCHEMES . HIS

POLITICAL AIMS ARE SIMPLE : " FOOD INSTEAD OF BULLETS, CLOTHING

INSTEAD OF UNIFORMS, HOUSES INSTEAD OF BARRACKS . " HIS NEW NATION HAS

THE PILOTS OFTEN HAVE TROUBLE FINDING A FOURTH FOR BRIDGE . " MY

AMBITION IS NOT A MIGHTY MALAYSIA, " SAYS ABDUL RAHMAN, " BUT HAPPY

HOSTILITY BETWEEN THE NEW NATION'S CHINESE AND MALAY POPULATIONS .

THROUGHOUT THE FEDERATION, THE ASTUTE, PROSPEROUS, HARD-BARGAINING

CHINESE DOMINATE BUSINESS, INDUSTRY AND TRADE, HAVE ECONOMICALLY FAR

OUTSTRIPPED THE RURAL, EASYGOING MALAYS . CHINESE TYCOONS CONTROL NORTH

BORNEO'S BOOMING YOUNG TIMBER INDUSTRY AND SARAWAK'S VAST, ROLLING

PEPPER GARDENS ; IN MALAYA, ABDUL RAHMAN'S GOVERNMENT HAS COMPLAINED

THAT THE RICH, INBRED CHINESE BUSINESS COMMUNITY HAS ERECTED A " WALL

OF PREJUDICE " AGAINST AMBITIOUS YOUNG MALAY BUSINESSMEN . THE MALAYS

HAVE BUILT SOME WALLS OF THEIR OWN . BY MALAYAN LAW, ONLY ONEQUARTER OF

THE GOVERNMENT JOBS CAN GO TO NON-MALAYS, WHILE MALAYS GET SPECIAL

CONCESSIONS IN THE GRANTING OF SCHOLARSHIPS AND LICENSES FOR NEW

BUSINESSES . RIGID CITIZENSHIP REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN SET UP FOR THE

CHINESE (MALAYS ARE AUTOMATICALLY CITIZENS), AND THE BORNEO TERRITORIES

PLAN IMMIGRATION RESTRICTIONS TO KEEP CHINESE BUSINESSMEN OUT . "

SPECIAL PRIVILEGES ARE LIKE A GOLF HANDICAP, " RATIONALIZES MALAYA'S

CHINESE FINANCE MINISTER TAN SIEW SIN . " THEY ARE NOT TO HOLD THE

CHINESE DOWN, BUT TO HELP THE MALAYS ALONG . " GOLF EVERY MORNING . IT

IS IRONICALLY FITTING THAT THE COMPLICATED PROBLEMS OF FEDERATION ARE

THE PROVINCE OF A MAN WHO, ON THE FACE OF IT, IS SO UNCOMPLICATED

HIMSELF . " I AM A LAZY MAN, " ADMITS ABDUL RAHMAN CHEERFULLY, AND SIX

YEARS AS MALAYA'S PRIME MINISTER HAVE NOT ALTERED HIS EASYGOING WAYS .

THE TUNKU PLAYS GOLF EVERY MORNING (HANDICAP : 24), CHECKS THE RACING

CALENDAR BEFORE MAKING ADVANCE POLITICAL ENGAGEMENTS, ALWAYS TAKES A

NAP IN THE AFTERNOON . AN AVID SOCCER FAN AND SPORTS-CAR BUFF, HE IS

CHRONICALLY LATE FOR APPOINTMENTS, EXPLAINS : " BEING PUNCTUAL ALWAYS

WEARS ME OUT . " THE TUNKU HAS THE CHARISMA OF THE REALLY SUCCESSFUL

POLITICIAN . HIS TITLE DRAWS ENORMOUS RESPECT FROM THE MASSES, AND AT

THE SAME TIME HIS GENUINE CHARM AND EASYGOING MANNER QUICKLY WIN THEIR

CONFIDENCE . THOUGH HE IS A DEVOUT MOSLEM, ABDUL RAHMAN ENJOYS BRANDY

AND SODA ; HE IS ALSO AN EXCELLENT CURRY COOK . WITH HIS THIRD WIFE,

SHARIFAH RODZIAH, AND THEIR FOUR ADOPTED CHILDREN (TWO OF WHOM ARE

CHINESE), THE TUNKU LEADS A LIFE OF CHEERFUL DISORDER IN KUALA

LUMPUR'S OPEN, AIRY PRIME MINISTER'S RESIDENCE, ALLOWS THE 70 CHILDREN

OF HIS SERVANTS THE RUN OF THE HOUSE ; VISITING DIPLOMATS ARE OFTEN

SURPRISED DURING A CONFERENCE TO SEE A SERVANT'S CHILD WANDER INTO THE

SITTING ROOM AND CLIMB UP ONTO THE TUNKU'S LAP . THE TUNKU HAS SOLVED

THE PROBLEM OF PAPER WORK SIMPLY : HE DOES NOT READ IT . HE HAS ALWAYS

HAD AN AVERSION TO THE PRINTED PAGE, AS A STUDENT PICKED UP THE KNACK

OF ABSORBING PERTINENT PASSAGES FROM BOOKS OR PAPERS THAT WERE READ

ALOUD TO HIM . BUT THOUGH HE HAS NO INTELLECTUAL PRETENSIONS, THE TUNKU

COMMANDS UNSWERVING LOYALTY FROM HIS BRILLIANT SUBORDINATES FOR HIS

ALMOST CHARMED ABILITY TO AVOID POLITICAL MISTAKES . SAYS AN AIDE : "

HE UNDERSTANDS THE MALAY MIND BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE EVER HAS . "

ABDUL RAHMAN AGREES . " I HAVE THE FEEL OF THE PEOPLE, " HE SAYS . " I

HAVE THE TOUCH . " THE

TUNKU'S FIRST WIFE, WHO DIED OF MALARIA IN 1935, WAS THE MOTHER OF HIS

TWO CHILDREN, DAUGHTER KATHIJAH, 29, WIFE OF A MALAYAN STUDYING IN

BRITAIN, AND SON NERANG, 27, NOW A MAJOR IN THE MALAYAN ARMY . HIS

SECOND WIFE WAS A WHITE ENGLISHWOMAN, VIOLET COULSON, WHOM HE MARRIED

OVER THE PROTESTS OF HIS FAMILY ; THEY WERE DIVORCED IN 1946 .

THE PLAYBOY PRINCE . ABDUL RAHMAN

WAS THE SEVENTH SON OF HIS FATHER'S SIXTH WIFE AND, WITH HIS 44

BROTHERS AND SISTERS, LIVED THE PLUSH LIFE BEFITTING THE OFFSPRING OF

THE SULTAN OF KEDAH . HIS SIAMESE MOTHER DEMANDED THAT HE BE CARRIED TO

SCHOOL ON THE SHOULDERS OF A RETAINER, AND THOUGH HE WAS AN INDIFFERENT

STUDENT, HIS ROYAL BIRTH WON HIM A SCHOLARSHIP TO CAMBRIDGE, WHERE HE

BEGAN TO READ LAW . BUT THE TUNKU SKIPPED MOST OF HIS LECTURES, SELDOM

MISSED A TEA OR DINNERDANCE, DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF MAINLY BY PICKING UP

28 TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS IN HIS SILVER RILEY WITH RED FENDERS . NOT

UNEXPECTEDLY, THE PLAYBOY PRINCE FLUNKED HIS BAR EXAMS . SO FAR DOWN

THE LINE OF SUCCESSION THAT HE HAD NO CHANCE OF EVER ATTAINING HIS

FATHER'S SULTANATE, THE TUNKU RETURNED TO MALAYA AS A MINOR CIVIL

SERVANT IN A NUMBER OF REMOTE OUTPOSTS . ON FOOT AND ON ELEPHANT, HE

TRAVELED THROUGH THE BUSH GETTING TO KNOW THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE, ONCE

EVEN WORKED AS A MANUAL LABORER TO HELP BUILD A NEW MOSQUE, WHICH THE

GRATEFUL MALAYS NAMED RAHMANIAH AFTER HIM . WORLD WAR II AND JAPAN'S

SWIFT CONQUEST OF THE MALAYAN PENINSULA HASTENED ABDUL RAHMAN'S

MATURITY . AS A USEFUL DISTRICT OFFICER, THE TUNKU WAS KEPT ON THE JOB

BY THE JAPANESE . SECRETLY, HOWEVER, HE HELPED HIDE ESCAPEES FROM

JAPANESE DEATH CAMPS, KEPT IN CONTACT WITH BRITISH GUERRILLA UNITS,

WHICH WERE SUPPLYING ARMS TO ANTI-JAPANESE COMMUNIST IRREGULARS IN THE

JUNGLES . " WHO THE HELL IS HE ? " ABDUL RAHMAN WAS ALSO IN CONTACT

WITH THE MALAYAN INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT THAT BEGAN TO TAKE ROOT WHEN THE

JAPANESE OUSTED THE BRITISH . WITH THE END OF THE WAR, AT THE AGE OF

42, THE TUNKU RETURNED TO ENGLAND TO GET HIS LAW DEGREE, BEGAN TO PLAY

A LARGER PART IN THE CAUSE OF MERDEKA (FREEDOM) . HE INSISTED THAT IT

WAS THE DUTY OF EVERY MALAY IN BRITAIN TO JOIN THE NATIONALISTIC MALAY

SOCIETY . BECAUSE OF HIS AGE AND LONG EXPERIENCE IN THE CIVIL SERVICE,

YOUNGER MALAY STUDENTS LOOKED TO HIM AS THEIR LEADER, CALLED HIM

BECAUSE OF HIS DARKER SKIN " BLACK UNCLE . " IN FIERY POLITICAL BULL

SESSIONS WITH YOUTHFUL FOLLOWER TUN ABDUL RAZAK, THE SEEDS OF A FUTURE

POLITICAL PARTNERSHIP WERE BEING SOWN ; TODAY RAZAK IS THE MOST

TRUSTED MEMBER OF HIS CABINET . BACK HOME, THE MIDDLE-AGING LAWYER

JOINED THE UNITED MALAY NATIONALIST ORGANIZATION, SLOWLY BEGAN BUILDING

UP A POLITICAL FOLLOWING IN HIS NATIVE KEDAH . IN OTHER MALAY STATES,

THE TUNKU'S FIREBRAND FOLLOWERS FROM THE LONDON DAYS BEGAN PUSHING HIM

FOR THE PARTY LEADERSHIP ; FINALLY, IN 1951, ABDUL RAHMAN TOOK OVER AS

BOSS OF THE U.M.N.O . " NOBODY HAD EVER HEARD OF HIM, " AN OFFICIAL

RECALLS . " I REMEMBER PEOPLE ASKING " WHO THE HELL IS HE ? " ' THEY

SOON FOUND OUT . CONVINCED THAT HE COULD ONLY ACHIEVE NATIONAL

LEADERSHIP AT THE HEAD OF A MULTIRACIAL UNITED FRONT, ABDUL RAHMAN

MUTED HOTLY ANTI-CHINESE SENTIMENT IN HIS OWN MALAY PARTY, STUMPED THE

COUNTRY URGING CHINESE AND INDIAN LEADERS TO UNITE BEHIND HIM UNDER THE

BANNER OF A NEW ORGANIZATION CALLED THE ALLIANCE PARTY . TO FINANCE HIS

CRUSADE, HE SOLD HIS EXPENSIVE CARS AND MOST OF HIS OTHER PROPERTY . "

I WORKED LIKE MAD, LIVING AND SLEEPING ON TRAINS, " SAYS THE TUNKU . "

I WAS OFTEN HOME ONLY ONE DAY A MONTH . " BUT ABDUL RAHMAN'S ZEAL PAID

OFF . IN THE 1955 GENERAL ELECTION, THE ALLIANCE SWEPT 51 OF THE 52

SEATS IN THE FEDERAL LEGISLATURE, AND THE TUNKU TOOK OVER AS CHIEF

MINISTER UNDER THE BRITISH HIGH COMMISSIONER . MERDEKA . ABDUL RAHMAN

WAS SO BUSY POLITICKING THAT HE HAD TAKEN LITTLE MILITARY INTEREST IN

THE BRUTAL, BLOODY GUERRILLA WAR THAT 350,000 BRITISH AND MALAYAN

TROOPS AND HOME GUARDSMEN WERE WAGING AGAINST COMMUNIST INSURGENTS IN

MALAYA'S TANGLED JUNGLES . BUT AFTER HIS 1955 ELECTION LANDSLIDE, THE

TUNKU GREW AFRAID THAT THE BRITISH MIGHT USE THE EMERGENCY TO DELAY

INDEPENDENCE, ARRANGED TO MEET THE COMMUNIST REBEL CHIEFTAINS IN

NORTHERN MALAYA TO SEE IF SOME SORT OF SETTLEMENT COULD BE WORKED OUT .

/ MY IDEAS ABOUT COMMUNISM WERE DETERMINED BY THAT MEETING, " SAYS THE

TUNKU . " I BECAME CONVINCED THAT ONCE A COMMUNIST, ALWAYS A COMMUNIST

. THEY COULD NEVER COEXIST WITH US IN AN INDEPENDENT MALAYA . /

AS THE WAR IN THE JUNGLE BEGAN TAKING A

TURN FOR THE BETTER, ABDUL RAHMAN FLINTILY TOLD BRITAIN THAT THE TIME

WAS LONG OVERDUE FOR MALAYA'S INDEPENDENCE . AFTER MONTHS OF HAGGLING

AND DELAY, THE TUNKU FINALLY FORCED BRITAIN'S COLONIAL SECRETARY ALAN

LENNOX-BOYD (NOW LORD BOYD) TO THE CONFERENCE TABLE . THROUGHOUT THE

GRUELING, THREE-WEEK SESSION IN LONDON, THE TUNKU REFUSED TO BUDGE FROM

HIS ULTIMATUM THAT INDEPENDENCE MUST COME NO LATER THAN AUG . 31, 1957

. " WHEN THE SIAMESE HAVE NO INTENTION OF YIELDING, THEY JUST APPEAR

STUPID, " HE TOLD SUBORDINATES . " I'M HALF SIAMESE, YOU KNOW . " AT

LAST, LENNOX-BOYD GOT THE POINT AND CAVED IN . ON THE TUNKU'S TARGET

DATE, INDEPENDENT MALAYA AT LAST CAME INTO BEING . " GOOD OLD TUNKU . "

THE TUNKU HAD NO REVOLUTIONARY BLUEPRINT FOR HIS NEW NATION, BROUGHT

INTO HIS CABINET HIS OLD LONDON CRONY, ABDUL RAZAK, TO HAMMER OUT A

PROGRAM FOR ORDERLY PROGRESS . WHILE ABDUL RAHMAN GROUND DOWN HARD ON

RED SUBVERSIVES, MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT RAZAK (IN THE POST HE

WILL RETAIN IN MALAYSIA'S NEW GOVERNMENT) STARTED A PROGRAM OF NEW

ROADS, SCHOOLS AND CLINICS TO BOOST THE STANDARD OF LIVING IN THE

PRIMITIVE KAMPONGS (VILLAGES), WHERE THE COMMUNISTS WERE TRYING TO GAIN

A FOOTHOLD . IN THE AIR-CONDITIONED " OPERATIONS ROOM " OF HIS

MINISTRY, GADGET-LOVING RAZAK CAREFULLY WATCHED THE PROGRESS OF HIS

BULLDOZERS ON DOZENS OF CHARTS, MOVIE SCREENS AND MAP DISPLAYS, KEPT

HIS PROGRAM CONSTANTLY AHEAD OF SCHEDULE WITH HIS COLD INSISTENCE ON

RESULTS OR ELSE . ABDUL RAHMAN MADE NO EFFORT TO SQUEEZE THE BRITISH

OUT OF THE COUNTRY, WAS CONVINCED THAT THE CONTINUED ECONOMIC AND

MILITARY PRESENCE OF THE BRITISH WAS THE BEST POSSIBLE INSURANCE FOR

MALAYAN STABILITY . TODAY A BRITISH OFFICER COMMANDS THE MALAYAN ARMY,

FIVE SENIOR BRITISH CIVIL SERVANTS HOLD KEY POSITIONS IN MALAYAN

GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES, AND BRITISH BUSINESSMEN CONTROL MORE THAN HALF

OF THE RUBBER INDUSTRY, REPATRIATE $86 MILLION IN PROFITS ANNUALLY . "

IT'S WONDERFUL HOW THIS PLACE HAS FLOWERED SINCE INDEPENDENCE, " SAYS

ONE BUSINESSMAN . " WE'RE REALLY MUCH BETTER OFF . GOOD OLD TUNKU . "

PARLEYS ON THE GREEN . WITH HIS YOUNG NATION BOOMING, ABDUL RAHMAN

LOOKED WITH INCREASING FEAR AT THE PREDICAMENT OF NEIGHBORING

SINGAPORE, JUST THREE-QUARTERS OF A MILE ACROSS THE JOHORE STRAIT .

THERE COMMUNISM WAS SPREADING LIKE AN INFECTION AMONG THE UNDERFED,

UNDEREMPLOYED MASSES IN SINGAPORE'S SQUALID, TEEMING TENEMENT QUARTERS

. BY STRIKES, RIOTS AND BOYCOTTS, THE PEKING-ORIENTED, COMMUNIST-FRONT

BARISAN SOCIALIST PARTY TRIED TO TOPPLE THE TOTTERING GOVERNMENT GLUED

TOGETHER BY SINGAPORE'S SHIFTY, BRILLIANT, CAMBRIDGE-EDUCATED PRIME

MINISTER LEE KUAN YEW, 39 . NEVER TOO CHOOSY ABOUT WHERE HE GOT

POLITICAL SUPPORT, " HARRY " LEE FIRST TRIED COOPERATION WITH THE

COMMUNISTS, LATER ADOPTED A " LEFTIST, NOT EXTREMIST, NONCOMMUNIST, NOT

ANTI-COMMUNIST " POLICY . IT DID NOT WORK ,SAVE HIS POLITICAL NECK, HE

WAS FORCED TO GO FOR HELP TO AN OLD GOLFING PARTNER ABDUL RAHMAN .

LEE'S VACATION HOUSE BORDERED A FAIRWAY OF KUALA KUMPUR'S RAMBLING

SELANGOR GOLF CLUB, WHERE THE TUNKU SHOT HIS DAILY ROUND . FROM TEE TO

GREEN, LEE TRIED TO CONVINCE ABDUL RAHMAN THAT SINGAPORE'S RICKETY

COALITION COULD NEVER SURVIVE ANOTHER ELECTION, AND THAT A RED

SINGAPORE COULD ONLY SPELL TROUBLE FOR MALAYA . GRADUALLY, THE TUNKU

CAME TO THE FRIGHTENING CONCLUSION THAT SINGAPORE MIGHT WELL BECOME " A

CHINESE CUBA . " ONE SOLUTION TO THE " SINGAPORE PROBLEM " WAS OBVIOUS

: A MERGER, SO THAT MALAYA'S POWERFUL INTERNAL SECURITY POLICE COULD

MOVE IN AND HELP SINGAPORE AUTHORITIES HOLD RED SUBVERSION IN CHECK .

BUT THE TUNKU SHUDDERED AT THE PROSPECT OF UPSETTING HIS NATION'S MALAY

RACIAL PREPONDERANCE BY THE ADDITION OF SINGAPORE'S 1,300,000 CHINESE .

/ IN ORDER TO BALANCE THE POPULATION, " HE SAYS, " I THOUGHT OF THE

BORNEO TERRITORIES . /

WINING & DINING . SARAWAK, BRUNEI AND

NORTH BORNEO, HOWEVER, WERE LESS THAN ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE FEDERATION

SCHEME . BORNEO LEADERS RESENTED BEING INVITED TO JOIN MERELY AS A

POLITICAL AND RACIAL ACCOMMODATION, DESIRED INSTEAD SOME SORT OF

INDEPENDENCE OF THEIR OWN . THEN BRITAIN BEGAN PUTTING QUIET PRESSURE

ON THE THREE TERRITORIAL GOVERNMENTS, TRIED TO PERSUADE THEM THAT UNION

IN MALAYSIA OFFERED THEM FAR MORE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL POWER THAN

THEY COULD EVER ACHIEVE BY THEMSELVES . BUT IT WAS ABDUL RAHMAN WHO

SOLD THE SCHEME . THE TUNKU WINED AND DINED A CONTINUOUS STREAM OF

BORNEO DELEGATIONS IN KUALA LUMPUR, WARMED UP BORNEO LEADERS COOL TO

THE FEDERATION WITH PROMISES OF FAVORED POLITICAL POSITIONS IN THE NEW

NATION . HE SHREWDLY OFFERED THE BORNEO TERRITORIES 70 SEATS IN THE

FEDERAL PARLIAMENT, AGAINST ONLY 15 FOR FAR MORE POPULOUS SINGAPORE AND

104 FOR MALAYA . HE PROMISED TAX CONCESSIONS AND A $12 MILLION DOLLOP

OF MALAYAN AID ANNUALLY TO THE TERRITORIES, AGREED TO KEEP FEDERAL

HANDS OFF BRUNEI'S OIL RESERVES . IT WAS THE TUNKU'S FONDEST HOPE THAT

THE NEW NATION COME INTO BEING ON AUG . 31, 1963, THE SIXTH ANNIVERSARY

OF MALAYA'S INDEPENDENCE . THEN LAST DECEMBER CAME A BLOW THAT

THREATENED TO DESTROY THE TUNKU'S TIMETABLE . IT WAS THE UPRISING IN

BRUNEI . " JUST TOO MUCH . " DISCONTENT WITH THE SULTAN OF BRUNEI'S

CORRUPT, INEFFICIENT AND AUTOCRATIC REGIME HAD LONG BEEN FESTERING IN

THE TINY, DELAWARE-SIZED TERRITORY . LAST YEAR THE SULTAN'S GOVERNMENT

SPENT ONLY $50,000 ON DRUGS AND MEDICINE FOR ITS PEOPLE, WHILE LAYING

OUT $47,000 FOR ELECTRICAL ILLUMINATION ON THE SULTAN'S BIRTHDAY ACTION

ON REQUESTS TO THE GOVERNMENT USUALLY TOOK FROM SIX MONTHS TO THREE

YEARS . THE DOMINANT BUT POWERLESS PEOPLE'S PARTY WAS ALSO DEAD-SET

AGAINST MALAYSIA ; THE PARTY'S ERRATIC, GOATEED ONETIME VETERINARIAN

LEADER, SHEIK A . M . AZAHARI, 34, WANTED INSTEAD TO ALIGN BRUNEI,

SARAWAK AND NORTH BORNEO INTO A SINGLE INDEPENDENT STATE WITH HIMSELF

AS ITS LEADER . WHEN IT FINALLY ERUPTED, THE REVOLT WAS POORLY

ORGANIZED AND BADLY LED . FOUR BATTALIONS OF BRITAIN'S TOUGH LITTLE

GURKHA TROOPS LANDED ON BRUNEI, INSIDE OF A WEEK SENT THE SHATTERED

REMNANTS OF THE 3,000MAN REBEL ARMY SCUTTLING BACK INTO HIDING IN

BRUNEI'S STEAMING JUNGLES . BUT THE BRUNEI REVOLT AT LAST GAVE THE

PHILIPPINES AND INDONESIA, FOR DIFFERENT REASONS, AN EXCUSE TO DISPLAY

THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE SCHEME . OBLIVIOUS TO MALAYA'S SUCCESS AGAINST

RED INFILTRATION, THE PHILIPPINES FEARED THAT LEFTISTS WOULD ULTIMATELY

TAKE OVER THE NEW NATION, THUS PUTTING A CUMMUNIST NEIGHBOR RIGHT ON

THEIR DOORSTEP . DUSTING OFF AN OLD CLAIM TO NORTH BORNEO, THE

PHILIPPINES MAINTAINED THAT IN 1878 THE SULTAN OF SULU HAD ONLY "

LEASED, " NOT SOLD, THE TERRITORY TO THE BRITISH . LONDON STIFFLY

REJECTED THE FILIPINO CLAIM TO THE REGION .

INDONESIA SHOUTED THAT THE TURMOIL

SHOWED THE DEEP DISSATISFACTION WITH MALAYSIA IN THE BORNEO

TERRITORIES, AND THAT THE FEDERATION WAS ONLY A PLOT TO EXTEND

BRITAIN'S COLONIAL INFLUENCE IN ASIA . RABBLE-ROUSING PRESIDENT SUKARNO

KNEW THAT A BRITISH-BACKED, ECONOMICALLY VIABLE MALAYSIA WOULD NOT ONLY

DERAIL HIS AMBITION TO EXTEND HIS INFLUENCE OVER THE BORNEO

TERRITORIES, BUT MIGHT ALSO SERVE AS AN INDUCEMENT TO REBELLION FOR THE

PEOPLE OF DEPRESSED INDONESIAN BORNEO . MOREOVER, ABDUL RAHMAN HAS

IGNORED EVERY " REVOLUTIONARY PRINCIPLE " FOR WHICH SUKARNO STANDS, HAS

IN THE PROCESS CREATED A CONSERVATIVE, PROSPEROUS NATION, WHILE

REVOLUTIONARY, LEFTIST INDONESIA, WITH ITS 100 MILLION PEOPLE, HAS SLID

TO THE EDGE OF ECONOMIC RUIN . SAYS A DIPLOMAT :. " TO HAVE A LITTLE

COUNTRY LIKE THIS EXTENDING ITS INFLUENCE IN SOUTHEAST ASIA WAS JUST

TOO MUCH FOR SUKARNO . " SOUND GROUND . IN A DRUMFIRE OF PROPAGANDA

OUTBURSTS, INDONESIA HAILED THE " BRUNEI FREEDOM FIGHTERS, " LASHED OUT

AT " BRITISH MERCENARIES AND PUPPETS, " GRANTED POLITICAL ASYLUM TO

BRUNEI LEADER AZAHARI, RAVED THAT ABDUL RAHMAN WAS " ROUND THE BEND . "

(RETORTED THE TUNKU : " WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT FROM A PIG BUT A GRUNT ?

/ ) DJAKARTA MOBS HANGED THE TUNKU IN EFFIGY, AND SUKARNO DECLARED A "

POLICY OF CONFRONTATION " AGAINST MALAYA . INDONESIAN JETS BUZZED

MALAYAN SHIPS IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA, AND ARMY LEADERS DARKLY

THREATENED " INCIDENTS OF PHYSICAL CONFLICT " ALONG THE BORDER OF

BRUNEI AND INDONESIA . SUKARNO DID NOT DARE TO INVADE ; HE PLAINLY

HOPED TO INDUCE THE UNITED NATIONS TO STEP IN AND PLACATE HIM AS IT DID

WITH WEST NEW GUINEA THUS SPARING HIM THE NECESSITY OF FIGHTING FOR

WHAT HE WANTS . HOWEVER, THE U.N . SEEMS UNWILLING TO PLAY SUKARNO'S

GAME ; A U.N . OBSERVER TEAM TOLD HIM THAT MALAYSIA IS " ON SOUND

LEGAL GROUND . " PROMISE TO " BROTHERS . " LAST WEEK IN MANILA, THE

ACRID DISPUTE BETWEEN INDONESIA, THE PHILIPPINES, AND MALAYSIA ADDED AN

UNDERTONE OF TENSION TO THE OTHERWISE CALM MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION

OF SOUTHEAST ASIA . NOT ON THE OFFICIAL AGENDA, THE MALAYSIA QUESTION

CAME UP REPEATEDLY IN LONG PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN ABDUL RAHMAN AND

PHILIPPINES PRESIDENT DIOSDADO MACAPAGAL . THE TUNKU WAS ANXIOUS FOR

THE WHOLE MATTER TO BE SETTLED QUIETLY . IN AN ATTEMPT TO BE REASONABLE

AND FRIENDLY WITH HIS " MALAY BROTHERS, " HE AGREED TO LOOK INTO THE

FILIPINO CLAIM TO NORTH BORNEO, LUKEWARMLY ENDORSED A PROPOSAL FOR AN

ASIAN SUMMIT MEETING BETWEEN HIMSELF, MACAPAGAL, AND INDONESIA'S

SUKARNO . BUT THE TUNKU VETOED THE SUGGESTION THAT HE POSTPONE THE

CREATION OF MALAYSIA UNTIL SOME SETTLEMENT COULD BE REACHED ; THE

FEDERATION, HE SAID, WOULD COME INTO BEING BY AUG . 31 AS PLANNED .

FROM THE STANDPOINT OF LANGUAGE, RELIGION, CULTURE OR GEOGRAPHY,

MALAYSIA IS NOT A NATURAL NATION . BUT ABDUL RAHMAN HAS FACED PROBLEMS

SIMILAR TO MALAYSIA'S IN HIS OWN MALAYA AND THERE A DECENT SOCIETY HAS

FLOURISHED . HE DOES NOT PROMISE THE MOON TO HIS NEW NATION, ONLY A

SANE, HUMANE, WORKABLE GOVERNMENT . UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP, MALAYSIA CAN

BE, AS JOHN F . KENNEDY HAS SAID, " THE BEST HOPE OF SECURITY IN THAT

VITAL PART OF THE WORLD . /

THE ALLIES AT LEAST THEY'RE SPEAKING THAW ! CRIED U.S .

HEADLINES . OPERATION CHARM ! PURRED THE PARIS PRESS . THE BIG NEWS,

OF COURSE, WAS THAT CHARLES DE GAULLE LAST WEEK WAS ON SPEAKING TERMS

WITH HIS ALLIES . IN PARIS TO ATTEND A MEETING OF THE SOUTH-EAST ASIA

TREATY ORGANIZATION, SECRETARY OF STATE DEAN RUSK CHATTED " CORDIALLY "

WITH FRANCE'S PRESIDENT FOR ABOUT 35 MINUTES, COUNTING TIME OUT FOR

TRANSLATION . BRITAIN'S FOREIGN SECRETARY LORD HOME AND FRANCE'S

FOREIGN MINISTER MAURICE COUVE DE MURVILLE, WHO HAVE BEEN SNUBBING ONE

ANOTHER EVER SINCE BRITAIN WAS EXCLUDED FROM THE COMMON MARKET LAST

JANUARY, ALSO EXCHANGED CIVILITIES . WHAT'S MORE, AT AN ELYSEE PALACE

RECEPTION FOR SEATO DELEGATES FROM EIGHT COUNTRIES, LE GRAND CHARLES

AFFABLY DECLARED : " SECURITY MEANS COOPERATION . " SUBS, PLEASE . WAS

THIS PROGRESS ? SKEPTICS NOTED THAT FRANCE'S GOVERNMENT SEEMED MORE

INCLINED TO TALK COOPERATION THAN TO PRACTICE IT . AFTER INDICATING

THAT THEY MIGHT HONOR A 15-MONTH-OLD AGREEMENT TO ACCEPT

U.S.-CONTROLLED WARHEADS FOR ITS GERMAN-BASED F-100 FIGHTERBOMBERS, THE

FRENCH BRUSQUELY DENIED THAT THEY HAD ANY PRESENT PLANS " CONCERNING

THE USE OF THESE PLANES WITHIN NATO . " NOTHING DAUNTED, U.S .

OFFICIALS IN PARIS LEAKED WISHFUL REPORTS THAT FRANCE'S NUCLEAR FORCE

DE FRAPPE IS BADLY BEHIND SCHEDULE AND BESET WITH EVERMOUNTING

TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL PROBLEMS . DE GAULLE, IT WAS HINTED, WAS ABOUT

READY TO RETURN TO THE NATO FOLD . NOT SO, RETORTED A HIGH-RANKING

FRENCH OFFICIAL . FRANCE, HE INSISTED, WILL HAVE ITS FIRST 50 MIRAGE IV

A-BOMBERS IN SERVICE BY DECEMBER 1965, ON SCHEDULE ; EXPECTS TO HAVE

ITS OWN H-BOMB " WELL BEFORE " 1970 ; AND IS ACTUALLY AHEAD OF

SCHEDULE WITH ITS MISSILE-LAUNCHING SUBMARINE, NOW DUE IN 1968 . THUS

DE GAULLE HAD NO REASON TO BACK AWAY FROM HIS DECLARED AIM OF NUCLEAR

INDEPENDENCE . AS THE GAULLIST PARIS-PRESSE POINTED OUT, " IT IS HIS

PARTNERS WHO HAVE GREATLY CHANGED THEIR TONE " SINCE THE GENERAL

REJECTED THE U.S . OFFER OF NATO-COMMITTED POLARIS MISSILES LAST

JANUARY . THE U.S . WAS STILL PUSHING ITS LONG-TERM PLAN FOR A SURFACE

POLARIS FLEET MANNED BY MIXED CREWS . HOWEVER, BRITAIN HAS LITTLE

ENTHUSIASM FOR THE IDEA, WHILE WEST GERMANY AND ITALY, WHICH WERE BOTH

ENTHUSIASTIC AT FIRST, HAVE NOW INDICATED THAT THEY WOULD RATHER SINK

THEIR MONEY IN MULTIMANNED POLARIS SUBMARINES . WHAT THE U.S . DID WIN

LAST WEEK WAS SUBSTANTIAL AGREEMENT FROM ITS ALLIES EXCLUDING FRANCE ON

THE GENERAL OUTLINE OF A MORE LIMITED SCHEME, THE INTER-ALLIED,

NATOCONTROLLED STRIKE FORCE THAT WASHINGTON HOPES TO CREATE IN THE NEAR

FUTURE . JUST A GIMMICK ? AFTER A NATO SESSION IN PARIS AND

CONFERENCES IN LONDON ATTENDED BY RUSK, DEFENSE SECRETARY MCNAMARA AND

OTHER TOP POLICYMAKERS, THE U.S . ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD PRESENT NEXT

MONTH'S NATO MEETING IN OTTAWA WITH DETAILED PLANS FOR A NUCLEAR

COMMAND AND PLANNING STRUCTURE TO INTEGRATE THE NEW INTER-ALLIED FORCE

. IT WOULD INCLUDE BRITAIN'S V-BOMBERS AND, IN 1968, ITS POLARIS FLEET,

AS WELL AS THREE POLARIS SUBMARINES THAT THE U.S . HAS COMMITTED TO

NATO, AND OTHER ALLIED AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES . SOME ALLIED PLANNERS

DISMISSED THE U.S . PROPOSALS AS MERE " GIMMICKRY . " BUT AFTER ALL IT

WAS WESTERN EUROPE THAT HAD BEEN CLAMORING FOR A GREATER ROLE IN

NUCLEAR WEAPONS POLICY . NOW WASHINGTON HAD PRODUCED A PLAN THAT WOULD

GO A LONG WAY TOWARD MEETING THIS DEMAND . MOST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES

SEEMED ANXIOUS TO COOPERATE . PARIS REMAINED STIFFLY ALOOF, SUGGESTING

ONLY THAT IN THE EVENT OF WAR, ITS OWN DETERRENT MIGHT BE " COORDINATED

/ WITH A NATO NUCLEAR FORCE . IF ANY U.S . OFFICIALS REALLY BELIEVED,

AS THEY SAID LAST WEEK, THAT THE FRENCH HAD SHOWN A MORE " POSITIVE "

ATTITUDE TOWARD THE WESTERN ALLIANCE, THEY GRAVELY MISJUDGED THE AIMS

OF CHARLES DE GAULLE . SNAPPED A GERMAN DIPLOMAT : " OF COURSE THE

CRISIS ISN'T OVER . AND IT WON'T BE AS LONG AS DE GAULLE IS AROUND . "

YUGOSLAVIA HOW TO WIN JOB SECURITY LIKE MANY DURABLE DICTATORS,

YUGOSLAVIA'S MARSHAL TITO PRESERVES HIS ONE-MAN RULE BY THE SIMPLE

EXPEDIENT OF HOLDING DOWN THE KEY JOBS HIMSELF . HE IS

SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY, SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE

ARMED FORCES, AND CHIEF OF STATE . AS IF THAT WERE NOT ENOUGH,

BELGRADE'S COMPLAISANT FEDERAL PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED A

NEW NATIONAL CONSTITUTION LAST WEEK GIVING TITO THE PRESIDENCY FOR

GRAVELY THROUGH A FORMAL READING OF THE NEW CHARTER . AFTERWARD,

LOOKING REMARKABLY FIT FOR A MAN WHO WILL BE 71 NEXT MONTH, HE HAPPILY

AUTOGRAPHED COPIES OF THE CONSTITUTION . IN ADDITION TO SANCTIFYING

TITO'S SUPREMACY, THE DOCUMENT INCLUDED OTHER NOVELTIES . A NEW

ASSEMBLY WILL BE COMPOSED OF NO FEWER THAN FIVE CHAMBERS, EACH WITH ITS

OWN SPECIALTY . ONE WILL DEAL WITH ECONOMICS, OTHERS WITH EDUCATION,

SOCIAL, GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE, AND FEDERAL MATTERS . FOR THE FIRST

TIME, THERE WILL BE A PREMIER AND A VICE PRESIDENT, ALTHOUGH NEITHER

ONE IS DESIGNATED TO SUCCEED TITO IN THE EVENT OF HIS SUDDEN DEATH .

THEIR POWERS WILL BE STRICTLY LIMITED . UNDER THE NEW CONSTITUTION, THE

COMMUNIST PARTY REMAINS THE " FUNDAMENTAL INITIATOR OF POLITICAL

ACTIVITY . " SPAIN'S

FRANCISCO FRANCO IS THE ONLY OTHER DICTATOR WITH LEGAL LIFE TENURE AS

CHIEF OF STATE . GHANA'S STRONGMAN PRESIDENT, KWAME NKRUMAH, WAS VOTED

PERMANENTLY INTO OFFICE IN SEPTEMBER, BUT HIS HIGH DEDICATION MODESTLY

VETOED THE GESTURE, PREFERRING TO RELY ON ELECTIONS A SAFE ENOUGH

MIDDLE EAST UNION NOW THE ARAB WORLD LAST WEEK REELED IN

A DELIRIUM OF JOY . DAMASCUS RADIO REPEATEDLY SHRIEKED, " AHLAN BIL

WAHDA ! " (WELCOME TO UNION) . WHEN SYRIAN SOLDIERS SENT BURSTS OF

TRACER BULLETS STREAKING AGAINST THE NIGHT SKY, THE RADIO ANNOUNCER

HASTILY TOLD HIS EXCITED LISTENERS THAT IT WAS NOT REVOLUTION BUT

JUBILATION . THE DREAM HAS COME TRUE ! HEADLINED A BEIRUT PAPER .

ALEPPO NEARLY EXPLODED : ITS MAIN STREETS BECAME A SEA OF SCREAMING

HUMANITY, AND CARS INCHED ALONG HONKING THEIR HORNS TO THE RHYTHM, "

NAS-SER ! " ALGERIA'S PREMIER AHMED BEN BELLA CABLED THAT THIS WAS "

THE MOST WONDERFUL DAY OF MY LIFE ! " AND YEMEN'S STRONGMAN, ABDULLAH

SALLAL, HAILED THE " OUTSTANDING HISTORIC EVENT . " CHEERING CROWDS

MILLED THROUGH ADEN AND KUWAIT AND BAGHDAD . FESTERING WOUND . WHAT

THRILLED THE ARAB WORLD WAS THE CAIRO ANNOUNCEMENT THAT EGYPT, SYRIA

AND IRAQ HAD AT LAST AGREED TO UNITE IN A TRIPARTITE FEDERATION . THE

TERMS OF UNION WERE FAR STRONGER AND MORE CENTRALIZED THAN ARABS, OR

ANYONE ELSE, HAD EXPECTED . THERE HAD BEEN MUCH TALK OF A LOOSE

ASSOCIATION OF NATIONS MOVING SLOWLY OVER THE YEARS TOWARD ACTUAL UNITY

. BUT THE PULSING ENTHUSIASM OF THE MOMENT APPARENTLY SWEPT ASIDE MUCH

OF THE EARLIER RESTRAINT . A FEW DOZEN MEN IN CAIRO WERE GROPING FOR

THE POLITICAL BLUEPRINT FOR A NATION STRONGER, RICHER AND MORE POWERFUL

THAN ANY ARAB STATE FOR CENTURIES PAST . IF IT ALL WORKS OUT, THE

PROPOSED NEW MIDDLE EASTERN POWER COMPLEX WILL COVER 620,300 SQ . MI.,

STRETCH FROM THE BORDERS OF TURKEY AND IRAN TO SUDAN AND LIBYA, FROM

THE PERSIAN GULF TO THE MEDITERRANEAN AND FAR DOWN THE RED SEA COAST .

IT WOULD HAVE A POPULATION OF 40 MILLION PEOPLE (EXPECTED TO REACH 80

MILLION BY 1985, GREATER THAN THE LARGEST NATION OF WESTERN EUROPE) AND

A TOTAL GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT OF $5.7 BILLION . HERO OF THE HOUR WAS

EGYPT'S PRESIDENT GAMAL ABDEL NASSER . BETTER THAN ANY MAN, HE KNEW

THAT, ON THE HISTORICAL RECORD, THE ODDS WERE AGAINST SUCCESS . TIME

AND AGAIN, THE CHERISHED DREAM OF ARAB ONENESS HAS BEEN SHATTERED ON

THE IRRATIONALITY OF ARAB BEHAVIOR, ON PERSONAL RIVALRIES, AMBITIONS,

CLASS DIFFERENCES AND COMPLICATED LEVANTINE INTRIGUES . AMID SHOUTS OF

ARAB JOY, EGYPT AND SYRIA FORGED THE UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC IN 1958, ONLY

TO SEE IT COLLAPSE IN A WELTER OF BICKERING THREE YEARS LATER . DURING

THE PAST FIVE WEEKS OF NEGOTIATIONS IN CAIRO, RUMORS SPREAD OF

WRANGLING AND DISSENSION BETWEEN NASSER ON ONE SIDE AND THE SYRIAN AND

IRAQI LEADERS OF THE SOCIALIST BAATH PARTY ON THE OTHER . BOTH PICKED

AT THE " FESTERING WOUND " CAUSED BY BAATH'S BREAKUP OF THE EARLIER,

ILL-STARRED UNION OF EGYPT AND SYRIA IN THE UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC . EACH

PUT THE BLAME FOR FAILURE ON THE OTHER . FINALLY, AT A PLENARY SESSION

IN THE GILTAND-CREAM GREAT HALL OF KUBBAH PALACE, NASSER PROPOSED A

SHARING OF GUILT . " THE PRESENCE OF BAATH IN THE ARAB HOMELAND IS A

NECESSITY, " HE DECLARED . " THE RESIGNATION OF THE BAATH MINISTERS

FROM THE U.A.R . GOVERNMENT IN 1961 WAS A MISTAKE . ACCEPTING THE

RESIGNATIONS WAS ALSO A MISTAKE . " THE BAATHIST DELEGATES CLAPPED AND

CHEERED THIS BURYING OF THE HATCHET . IN A STARTLINGLY UN-ARAB SPIRIT

OF AMITY AND COMPROMISE, BOTH SIDES ACCEPTED THE OTHER'S GOOD FAITH AND

MINIMUM TERMS .

CHEERFUL BORROWING . THE POINTS OF AGREEMENT ANNOUNCED

BY EGYPT'S PREMIER ALI SABRY INCLUDE A FEDERAL STATE RETAINING THE NAME

OF THE UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC, WITH CAIRO AS ITS CAPITAL . ALL CITIZENS

WOULD SHARE ONE NATIONALITY, BUT EACH OF THE THREE REGIONS WOULD BE

SELF-GOVERNING AND IN CONTROL OF ITS SEPARATE ECONOMY . THE OVERALL

GOVERNMENT BASED IN CAIRO WOULD HAVE A SINGLE PRESIDENT (ALMOST

CERTAINLY NASSER), A PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL WITH MEMBERS FROM EACH REGION

AND A BICAMERAL LEGISLATURE : A HOUSE WITH ONE MEMBER FOR EACH 60,000

CITIZENS, AND A SENATE REPRESENTING THE REGIONS EQUALLY WITHOUT REGARD

TO POPULATION . THE ARAB PRESS CHEERFULLY ADMITTED THAT MUCH WAS

BORROWED FROM THE U.S . CONSTITUTION BECAUSE IT PROVIDED THE " IDEAL

FORM OF UNION AS PROVEN BY EXPERIENCE . " STICKING POINT IS NASSER'S

INSISTENCE ON A SINGLE POLITICAL PARTY FOR THE WHOLE

U.A.R., MODELED ON HIS OWN ARAB SOCIALIST UNION IN EGYPT . SINCE THIS

WOULD SWALLOW UP AND PROBABLY DESTROY THE BAATH MOVEMENT, BAATHISTS

HAVE HELD OUT FOR A LOOSER, MORE REPRESENTATIVE SYSTEM, INCLUDING THE

BAATH-CREATED NATIONAL FRONT IN IRAQ, AND THE BAATHIST-NASSERITE

UNIONIST FRONT IN SYRIA . IN THE END, NASSER WOULD PROBABLY HAVE HIS

WAY ON THIS, AS ON OTHER LIMITATIONS TO POLITICAL DEMOCRACY . A CAIRO

SPOKESMAN EXPLAINED, IN A PHRASE DEFINITELY NOT BORROWED FROM U.S .

DEMOCRACY, THAT " FREEDOM WILL BE GUARANTEED TO THE PEOPLE, BUT NOT TO

THE ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE . " THERE ARE MANY LESSER MATTERS STILL TO BE

DECIDED . COMMITTEES WOULD BE ASSIGNED TO WORK OUT DETAILS OF CURRENCY,

CUSTOMS, POSTAGE, DIPLOMATIC AND OTHER POLICIES . FOREIGN AFFAIRS WOULD

ARABIA, MADE EFFORTS AT RECONCILIATION . JORDAN'S KING HUSSEIN

DISCREETLY LET 56 NASSERITE AND BAATHIST POLITICAL PRISONERS OUT OF

JAIL AND SENT OFF FRIENDLY FEELERS TO NASSER . IN SAUDI ARABIA, ALARMED

BY A PRO-NASSER DEMONSTRATION THAT COST 19 LIVES, PREMIER PRINCE FEISAL

TRIED TO MODERNIZE HIS REGIME BY ALLOTTING $1,200,000 AS COMPENSATION

TO SLAVE OWNERSWHO WOULD FREE THEIR CHATTELS . AT WEEK'S END CAIRO

REBELLION-TORN YEMEN . IT SAID THAT SAUDI ARABIA WAS PREPARED TO STOP

SUPPLYING THE ROYALISTS SUPPORTING EX-IMAM BADR WITH MONEY AND

MUNITIONS, WHILE NASSER MAY WITHDRAW A TOKEN CONTINGENT OF HIS

28,000-MAN EGYPTIAN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE BY APRIL 20 . THOUGH NASSER'S

BROADCASTERS ARE NOT THE MOST RELIABLE SOURCES IN THE WORLD, THINGS MAY

WELL COME TO THIS, FOR WITHOUT DOUBT JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA AND ALL

OTHER ARABS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY ANXIOUS TO AVOID ANGERING NASSER

LUXEMBOURG MILLENNIUM IN CAMELOT ON AN APRIL DAY IN 963, COUNT

SIGFROI, A WAGNERIAN WARRIOR FROM THE ARDENNES, RAISED HIS BANNER OVER

A FORTRESS ON A FORMIDABLE ROCK ABOVE THE ALZETTE RIVER IN THE EASTERN

FRANKISH EMPIRE . THOUGH SIGFROI'S WIFE SOON VANISHED SHE TURNED OUT TO

BE A WATER NYMPH AND HIS FORTRESS CRUMBLED, THE FIEF HE FOUNDED PROVED

AS DURABLE AS IT IS DIMINUTIVE . IT IS FORMALLY KNOWN TODAY AS THE

GRAND DUCHY OF LUXEMBOURG AND, THOUGH INTERNATIONAL SURVEYS OFTEN OMIT

ITS STATISTICS ENTIRELY, IT IS A THRIVING CHARTER MEMBER OF THE

EUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITY AND THE COMMON MARKET, AS WELL AS THE

SMALLEST COUNTRY IN THE UNITED NATIONS, IN WHOSE BEHALF IT SENT AN

ARMED AND EAGER PLATOON TO KOREA IN 1951 . LAST WEEK, AS THEY MARKED

THEIR COUNTRY'S 1,000TH ANNIVERSARY, THE SOLID, EASYGOING

LUXEMBOURGEOIS LOOKED FORWARD TO A LONG SUMMER OF LOW-KEY CELEBRATION,

INCLUDING A DOG SHOW, ENDLESS WINE FESTIVALS, AN INTERNATIONAL STAMP

EXPOSITION, AND A VISIT BY TWO PLANELOADS OF KINFOLK FROM CHICAGO,

WHICH IS SAID TO BOAST MORE LUXEMBOURGEOIS THAN LUXEMBOURG (POP .

320,000). THE MYSTERY IS WHY THEY EVER LEFT IN THE FIRST PLACE . DIAL

219-61 . THE GRAND DUCHY TODAY IS A SORT OF CONSTITUTIONAL CAMELOT . IT

BOASTS 130 CASTLES (BUT NO UNIVERSITY), PRISTINE FORESTS WHERE WILD

BOAR ARE STILL HUNTED, CRYSTALLINE RIVERS THAT TEEM WITH CRAYFISH,

TROUT AND, OF COURSE, WATER NYMPHS . THE LUXEMBOURGEOIS, WHO ARE

WALKING ADVERTISEMENTS FOR THEIR CUISINE (FAMED SPECIALTIES : THRUSH

PIE AND PARTRIDGE CANAPE), BRAG THAT IT IS " FRENCH IN QUALITY, GERMAN

IN QUANTITY . " IN OTHER RESPECTS AS WELL, THEY CLAIM TO HAVE EUROPE'S

HIGHEST LIVING STANDARDS . THERE IS NEITHER UNEMPLOYMENT NOR SLUMS ;

ILLITERACY WAS BANISHED IN 1847, AND THE DUCHY'S BOOMING STEEL INDUSTRY

IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST PRODUCTIVE . " LUXEMBOURG, " ITS CITIZENS

SAY WITH SATISFACTION, " BELONGS TO THE LUXEMBOURGEOIS . " POLITICALLY,

LUXEMBOURG IS A FAMILYSTYLE DEMOCRACY IN WHICH STREET CLEANERS GREET

THE PRIME MINISTER BY HIS FIRST NAME . IF A CITIZEN GETS MAD AT THE

GOVERNMENT, HE HAS ONLY TO DIAL 219-61 TO HEAR A TELEPHONE OPERATOR

REPLY, " THE GOVERNMENT, " AND DIRECT HIM PROMPTLY TO THE APPROPRIATE

OFFICIAL . FOR ECONOMY'S SAKE, VIRTUALLY EVERY MEMBER OF THE CABINET

RUNS AT LEAST TWO MINISTRIES . PREMIER PIERRE WERNER, 49, WHO IS ALSO

MINISTER OF FINANCE, IS A GENIAL, TIRELESS CHRISTIAN SOCIALIST WHO

BUSTLES AROUND THE COUNTRY IN AN ANCIENT OFFICIAL BUICK AS CONCERNEDLY

AS IF THE GRAND DUCHY ALL 999 SQUARE MILES OF IT WERE ABOUT TO MELT

AWAY ALTOGETHER . A LOT TO OFFER . ACTUALLY, POLITICAL CRISES ARE FEW

AND FAR BETWEEN IN PLACID LUXEMBOURG . THROUGH TACTFUL TREATMENT OF

MINORITIES, THE GOVERNMENT HAS AVOIDED THE FATE OF NEIGHBORING BELGIUM,

WHERE BITTER ANTAGONISMS BETWEEN FLEMISH AND FRENCH-SPEAKING CITIZENS

ARE A CONSTANT THREAT TO STABILITY . THE LUXEMBOURGEOIS, WHO SPEAK

FRENCH, GERMAN AND A GOBBLEDYDEUTSCH CALLED MOSEL-FRANKISCH, DO NOT

EVEN HAVE AN OFFICIAL LANGUAGE . THEY ARE 96.9 PER CENT CATHOLIC, BUT

THE GOVERNMENT PAYS THE SALARIES OF THE COUNTRY'S SOLE RABBI AND ITS

ONLY PROTESTANT MINISTER . EVEN THE COUNTRY'S FEW COMMUNISTS PROFESS

LOYALTY TO THE ROYAL FAMILY . TITULAR HEAD OF STATE SINCE 1919 HAS BEEN

THE HANDSOME, HIGHLY ESTEEMED GRAND DUCHESS CHARLOTTE, 67, WHO LATER

THIS MONTH WILL PAY HER FIRST OFFICIAL VISIT TO THE U.S . SINCE SHE

ESCAPED IN WORLD WAR II TO HEAD HER GOVERNMENT IN EXILE . INDEED,

THOUGH THEY PUT UP A HEROIC RESISTANCE AGAINST THE GERMANS IN TWO WORLD

WARS, IN PEACETIME THE LUXEMBOURGEOIS KEEP TO THEMSELVES AS A MATTER OF

PRINCIPLE . SOME WESTERN DIPLOMATS WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE COUNTRY PLAY A

MORE ASSERTIVE ROLE IN WORLD AFFAIRS . " THEY HAVE A LOT TO OFFER, "

ARGUES ONE . " INTERNATIONALLY, LUXEMBOURG IS THE VOICE OF 20TH CENTURY

EUROPEANISM, THE VOICE OF REASON IN THE COMMON MARKET, NATO AND THE U.N

. BUT IT IS TOO MODEST . " IN FACT ONE OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S

UNDERLYING REASONS FOR INVITING THE GRAND DUCHESS TO WASHINGTON IS TO

SUGGEST THAT LUXEMBOURG SHOULD USE ITS MODERATING INFLUENCE MORE

READILY . BUT THE LUXEMBOURGEOIS ARE NOT LIKELY TO CHANGE THEIR WAYS .

/ WHEN CATS FIGHT, " THEY EXPLAIN, " KITTENS SHOULD STAY OUT OF THE WAY

. /

MANY ALSO EMIGRATED TO NEW ENGLAND, NOTABLY FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT'S

MATERNAL ANCESTORS, THE DELANOS (ORIGINALLY DELANOIS), WHOSE OLD

JORDAN CLOUDBURST AT PETRA JOHN WILLIAM BURGON, A 19TH CENTURY

BRITISH CLERGYMAN AND MINOR POET, WROTE A MEMORABLE LINE WHEN HE

DESCRIBED ANCIENT PETRA AS " A ROSE-RED CITY HALF AS OLD AS TIME . "

ROMANTIC, INACCESSIBLE, IT LIES IN THE MIDST OF A VAST DESERT IN

SOUTHERN JORDAN, AND TODAY, AS ALWAYS, ITS ONLY APPROACH IS THROUGH A

DEEP, NARROW GORGE CALLED THE SIQ, WHICH TRADITION SAYS WAS CREATED

WHEN MOSES STRUCK THE ROCK WITH HIS ROD . FROM 300 B.C . TO A.D . 100,

WHEN PETRA FLOURISHED AS THE CARAVAN CAPITAL OF THE NABATAEANS, THE SIQ

MADE THE CITY IMPREGNABLE, SINCE A FEW MEN IN THE SERPENTINE GORGE,

OFTEN NO MORE THAN TWO YARDS WIDE, COULD HOLD UP AN ARMY . TODAY, THE

NARROW THREE-MILE COURSE IS TRAVELED BY THOUSANDS OF TOURISTS WHO GO TO

GAPE AT THE ELABORATE TOMBS AND TEMPLES BUILT INTO ROCK THAT IS COLORED

CRIMSON, SEPIA, BROWN AND VIOLET, LIKE WATERED SILK . DESERT SPRINKLE .

TWO PARTIES OF FOREIGNERS REACHED THE ENTRANCE TO THE SIQ ONE DAY LAST

WEEK, EAGER TO JOURNEY THE REMAINING THREE MILES TO PETRA . THE FIRST

WAS A GROUP OF 23 FRENCHWOMEN MAKING A HOLY LAND PILGRIMAGE UNDER THE

TUTELAGE OF A PARISIAN PRIEST, ABBE JEAN STEINMANN, 52, VICAR OF NOTRE

DAME ;  THE SECOND WAS A LARGER GROUP OF ITALIAN PILGRIMS . THE

FRENCH PARTY GAILY ENTERED THE SIQ GORGE JUST AS A SPRINKLE OF RAIN

BEGAN TO FALL . FOUR WERE TRAVELING IN A LANDROVER, THE REST ON FOOT .

SUDDENLY, THE LIGHT RAIN BECAME A CLOUDBURST THE WORST IN ARID PETRA'S

RECORDED HISTORY . WITHIN HALF AN HOUR, TORRENTIAL FLOODS WERE

STREAMING DOWN FROM THE HILLS AND CLIFFS AND POURING INTO THE SIQ AS

INTO A FUNNEL . ONE ITALIAN PILGRIM SAID, " WE HEARD SHRIEKS AND CRIES

WITHIN THE RAVINE, AS THE MUDDY CASCADE OF WATER RUSHED BY US . WE SAW

THE LITTLE CAR WITH THE FOUR WOMEN AND THE DRIVER SWEPT ALONG BY THE

TORRENT AND THEN SUBMERGED . IN AN INSTANT, THEY ALL DISAPPEARED IN THE

FLOODWATERS RAGING ALONG AT PERHAPS 60 MILES AN HOUR . " PRAYERS ON THE

LEDGE . TWO YOUNG FRENCHWOMEN, WHO WERE DAWDLING ALONG BEHIND THE

PARTY, HEARD THE ROAR OF THE ONCOMING FLOOD AND MANAGED TO SCRAMBLE UP

THE ROCK WALL TO A LEDGE 12 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND . " THE WATER ROSE

HIGHER AND HIGHER, " SAID ONE . " IT GRADUALLY REACHED OUR FEET, THEN

OUR KNEES . WE COULD NOT SEE THE OTHERS, BUT WE HEARD THEIR CRIES .

SOON WE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE THUNDERING WATER . WE CLUNG TO THE LEDGE

AND PRAYED . " THOSE TWO WERE SAVED, BUT WHEN THE FLOOD SUBSIDED THREE

HOURS LATER, THE MUDDY FLOOR OF THE GORGE WAS LITTERED WITH SODDEN,

BATTERED BODIES ABBE STEINMANN, TWO ARABS (A GUIDE AND A DRIVER), AND

21 FRENCHWOMEN . PETRA POLICE FLASHED WORD OF THE DISASTER TO AMMAN

AND, DROPPING EVERYTHING, KING HUSSEIN FLEW HIS HELICOPTER TO THE SIQ

GORGE AND PERSONALLY DIRECTED OPERATIONS . THE TWO SURVIVORS WERE

RUSHED TO COMFORTABLE QUARTERS IN HUSSEIN'S BASMAN PALACE . THE 22

OTHERS, WHO NEVER QUITE REACHED THE ROSE-RED TOMBS OF PETRA, WERE

EMBALMED FOR AIR SHIPMENT AND BURIAL AT HOME IN FRANCE .

A FAMED BIBLICAL SPECIALIST, ABBE STEINMANN

WROTE SEVERAL BOOKS ON THE PROPHETS, BUT IN 1961 HIS LIFE OF JESUS WAS

PLACED ON THE VATICAN'S INDEX OF BANNED WORKS, AND A YEAR LATER THE

CHURCH FORBADE HIM ANY FURTHER BIBLICAL PUBLICATIONS . HOWEVER, ABBE

STEINMANN REMAINED VICAR OF NOTRE DAME .

SOUTH KOREA SILENT SAM, THE PRESSURE MAN THE WHITE HOUSE PUT THE

SQUEEZE ON THE BLUE HOUSE LAST WEEK, AND SOUTH KOREA'S MONTH-LONG

POLITICAL CRISIS VANISHED FOR THE MOMENT . BOWING TO WASHINGTON'S

WISHES, GENERAL PARK CHUNG HEE, WHO OCCUPIES SEOUL'S BLUE-ROOFED

PRESIDENTIAL MANSION, AGREED TO LET CIVILIAN POLITICIANS HAVE THEIR SAY

AT LEAST UNTIL NEXT AUTUMN . THE VICTORY BELONGED IN LARGE PART TO THE

MAN WHO RELAYED THE U.S . PRESSURE, SHORT, WIRY, U.S . AMBASSADOR

SEMUEL D . BERGER . CALLED " SILENT SAM " BY THE KOREAN PRESS FOR HIS

RELUCTANCE TO MAKE PUBLIC PRONOUNCEMENTS, CAREERIST BERGER, 51, IS A

DISCREET, BEHIND-THE-SCENES DIPLOMAT . WHEN GENERAL PARK

LAST MONTH IMPOSED A NEW BAN ON CIVILIAN POLITICAL ACTIVITIES AND

ANNOUNCED A REFERENDUM DESIGNED TO KEEP HIS MILITARY JUNTA IN POWER FOR

ANOTHER FOUR YEARS, BERGER SET ABOUT THE TASK OF CONVINCING THE GENERAL

THAT HE MUST ABIDE BY HIS PLEDGE TO PRESIDENT KENNEDY 17 MONTHS AGO TO

RESTORE CIVILIAN RULE IN 1963 . BERGER'S LEVER WAS THE U.S.'S ANNUAL

$500 MILLION AID PROGRAM TO SOUTH KOREA, WITHOUT WHICH PARK'S

GOVERNMENT COULD NOT REMAIN SOLVENT . TO A STEADY STREAM OF TOP KOREAN

OFFICIALS WHO CAME TO THE FOURSTORY U.S . EMBASSY IN DOWNTOWN SEOUL,

BERGER EXPLAINED THAT THE U.S . MIGHT HAVE TO RE-EXAMINE ITS AID

PROGRAM UNLESS PARK LET THE CIVILIANS COME BACK . TO SHOW THAT BERGER

WAS NOT BLUFFING, THE U.S . RECENTLY DELAYED A PROMISED $25 MILLION

DESPERATELY NEEDED BY SOUTH KOREA TO PAY FOR IMPORT PURCHASES . WHEN

PARK FINALLY CAVED IN LAST WEEK, AGREEING TO WAIT UNTIL SEPTEMBER TO

DECIDE WHETHER TO CALL FOR FREE ELECTIONS OR A VOTE ON HIS REFERENDUM,

CIVILIAN POLITICIANS WERE AT FIRST INCLINED TO GRUMBLE AT PARK'S

COMPROMISE . BUT IN FACT, THEY NEEDED THAT MUCH TIME TO ORGANIZE THEIR

PARTIES FOR AN ELECTION CAMPAIGN . THE CIVILIANS KNEW WHO THEIR MOST

POTENT OPPONENT WOULD BE : GENERAL PARK HIMSELF, WHO NO DOUBT WOULD

USE THE SIX-MONTH POSTPONEMENT TO BUILD UP A GRASS-ROOTS POLITICAL

ORGANIZATION STRONG ENOUGH TO HELP HIM SWITCH FROM FATIGUES TO FLANNELS

AND TAKE OFFICE AS A CIVILIAN PRESIDENT .

CORSICA JESUS FOR A NIGHT AND HE BEARING HIS CROSS WENT FORTH :

. ST . JOHN 19 : 17 PROMPTLY AT 9 : 30 P.M . ON GOOD FRIDAY LAST

WEEK, A GROTESQUE LUMP OF A MAN EMERGED FROM THE MEDIEVAL ROMAN

CATHOLIC CHURCH IN CORSICA'S OLIVE-GROWING VILLAGE OF SARTENE .

BAREFOOT, MASKED IN A BLOOD-RED HOOD WITH EYE SLITS, THE BENT FIGURE

STAGGERED UNDER THE WEIGHT OF A MASSIVE OAK CROSS . FROM HIS RIGHT

ANKLE DRAGGED A CLANKING, 31-LB . CHAIN . AND FROM UNDER THE HOOD CAME

AN ANGUISHED, MUFFLED CHANT : " PERDONNO, MIO DIO . . . PERDONNO . . . "

THUS, AS IT HAS EVERY SPRING SINCE THE MIDDLE AGES, BEGAN ONE OF THE

WORLD'S MOST BRUTALLY POWERFUL EASTER WEEK PROCESSIONS . THE HOODED

FIGURE WAS THAT OF A CONSCIENCE-STRICKEN FRENCH SINNER WHOSE IDENTITY

WAS KNOWN ONLY TO THE LOCAL CURATE, FATHER JEAN BAPTISTE SCUITTI . FROM

WHEREVER HE HAD COME, THE MAN WAS THERE VOLUNTARILY TO ATONE FOR HIS

SINS BY ENACTING THE ROLE OF CHRIST MAKING HIS WAY TO CALVARY . TO

CORSICANS, AS ALWAYS, HE WAS KNOWN ONLY AS LE CATENACCIU (THE ENCHAINED

ONE) . SO POPULAR IS THE PART THAT IT IS BOOKED SOLID FOR THE NEXT 40

YEARS BY APPLICANTS FROM AS FAR AWAY AS MADAGASCAR . THE LIST INCLUDES

GAMBLERS, ADULTERERS, EX-CONVICTS ALL SEEKING PEACE OF MIND . WITH IT,

THEY GET AN AWFUL LOT OF EXERCISE . THE PROCESSION, CHUCKLES FATHER

SCUITTI, " IS NO EVENING PROMENADE . " IN LAST WEEK'S MOCK TRIP TO

CALVARY, A SHORT, FAT MAN GRUNTED AND PUFFED AS HE BORE THE CROSS ALONG

A MILE-AND-A-HALF ROUTE . COMING OUT OF THE CHURCH, THE CATENACCIU GOT

HIS HUGE LOAD STUCK IN THE DOORWAY . THEN, AS HE STUMBLED ALONG DIRT

PATHS AND DARKENED, COBBLED STREETS, STRUGGLED PAINFULLY UP FLIGHTS OF

ANCIENT GRANITE STAIRS, HIS BARE FEET BEGAN TO BLEED . THRONGS OF

VILLAGERS AND 15,000 TOURISTS IN SARTENE FOR THE OCCASION GATHERED

ALONG THE ROUTE TO JEER . THREE TIMES THE CATENACCIU FELL UNDER HIS

BURDEN, AND EACH TIME A FELLOW PENITENT PLAYING THE PART OF SIMON OF

CYRENE WHISPERED FIERCELY : " GET UP ! YOU ASKED FOR THIS ! " AT

FORCED PROJECT OFFICIALS TO BAN GAMBLING, EXCEPT FOR BINGO AND SLOT

MACHINES . AS FOR GIRLS, POTENTIAL HUSTLERS WERE TOLD TO PEDDLE THEIR

WARES ELSEWHERE, THOUGH ONE WALKER HILL OFFICIAL ADMITTED THAT, " WHILE

WE DO NOT ALLOW PROSTITUTION, WE ARE NOT GOING TO INSIST ON COUPLES

READY FOR LAST WEEK'S GALA OPENING, AND GUESTS WERE SOMEWHAT SURPRISED

BEEF IN THE DINING ROOM WAS NOT BAD AT ALL . BUT WITHOUT ITS TWO MAJOR

HALF EMPTY . BECAUSE OF THE JUNTA'S SLOGAN, " AUSTERITY FOR PROGRESS, "

SOUTH KOREANS WERE NOT ALLOWED INSIDE UNLESS THEY CAME AS GUESTS OF

TREACHEROUS RED ATTACKS COMPLETED THE POLITICAL TRANSFORMATION OF KONG

LE, WHO ONCE WAS THE DARLING OF MOSCOW AND PEKING . TWO AND A HALF

YEARS AGO, KONG LE HAD JOINED FORCES WITH THE PATHET LAO ON THE PLAINE

DES JARRES AND WITH THEM DEMANDED THE WITHDRAWAL OF ALL THE WESTERN

TROOPS IN LAOS . BUT CONSISTENTLY NEUTRALIST, KONG LE TODAY IS AS

BITTERLY OPPOSED TO VIET MINH INTERVENTION IN LAOS AS HE HAD BEEN TO

THE PRESENCE OF U.S . MILITARY ADVISERS LAST OCTOBER . FORTNIGHT AGO HE

RAGED THAT THE VIET MINH WERE " FOREIGN LACKEYS " WHO HOPED TO MAKE

LAOS THEIR BASE TO SPREAD THEIR EVIL POLICIES THOUGHOUT SOUTHEAST ASIA

. HEART IN FRANCE . LAST WEEK KONG LE WAS DESPERATELY URGING HIS OLD

RIGHT-WING FOES TO SEND TROOPS TO HIS AID ON THE PLAINE DES JARRES .

BUT INEFFECTUAL NEUTRALIST PREMIER SOUVANNA PHOUMA FEARED THAT ANY SUCH

DETERMINED ACTION MIGHT UNGLUE HIS TOTTERING LEFT-RIGHT-CENTER

COALITION . SOUVANNA COULD NOT EVEN KEEP ORDER IN VIENTIANE, WHERE LAST

WEEK ANOTHER TOP NEUTRALIST THE SECOND IN A FORTNIGHT WAS GUNNED DOWN

IN HIS OWN HOUSE . " I DON'T KNOW WHICH FOOT TO DANCE ON, " SAID

SOUVANNA PLAINTIVELY . " I WISH I WAS ON THE SEASHORE IN FRANCE WITH MY

FAMILY . " AT WEEK'S END, AFTER THE REDS HAD CONSOLIDATED THEIR HOLD ON

XIENGKHOUANG, THE INTERNATIONAL CONTROL COMMISSION OF CANADA, POLAND

AND INDIA, WHICH HAD BEEN SET UP BY THE GENEVA CONFERENCE TO POLICE

LAOTIAN NEUTRALITY, FINALLY GOT APPROVAL FROM THE PATHET LAO TO FLY

INTO THE PLAINE DES JARRES ON A PEACEMAKING MISSION . MEANWHILE THE

U.S., SHUDDERING AT THE PROSPECT OF ANOTHER MASSIVE MILITARY COMMITMENT

IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, WAS HOPEFUL THAT THE ONSET OF THE RAINY SEASON WOULD

STALL OFF MAJOR HOSTILITIES . THE MOST THAT OPTIMISTIC U.S . OFFICIALS

COULD HOPE FOR IN LAOS WAS A CONTINUED STALEMATE ; REALISTS FELT,

HOWEVER, THAT AN EVENTUAL COMMUNIST TAKEOVER WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

. " ASKING WHAT YOU CAN DO SENSIBLY ABOUT LAOS IS LIKE ASKING A PATIENT

CLOSE TO DEATH TO COME IN EVERY TWO MONTHS TO SEE WHAT HIS DOCTOR CAN

DO FOR HIM, " SAID ONE RANKING U.S . INSIDER . " AFTER A WHILE, THERE

IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO BUT CALL THE UNDERTAKER . /

LAOS A NEW CIVIL WAR ? JUST NINE MONTHS AFTER THE

14-NATION GENEVA CONFERENCE GUARANTEED LAOTIAN NEUTRALITY, LAOS LAST

WEEK TOTTERED ON THE BRINK OF CIVIL WAR AND ONCE AGAIN THREATENED TO

DRAG THE MAJOR POWERS INTO A BITTER STRUGGLE . FOR THREE WEEKS, THE RED

FORCES, REINFORCED BY CADRES OF VIET MINH TROOP COMMANDERS, MORTAR

SPECIALISTS AND ARTILLERY ADVISERS FROM COMMUNIST NORTH VIET NAM, HAD

BEEN NIBBLING AWAY AT NEUTRALIST POSITIONS AROUND THE 30-MILE PERIMETER

OF THE GRASSY, POOL-TABLE-FLAT PLAINE DES JARRES . STRATEGICALLY PLACED

IN THE CENTER OF LAOS, THE PLAIN NAMED AFTER THE ANCIENT STONE BURIAL

JARS STILL FOUND IN THE AREA CONTROLS THE APPROACHES TO THE REST OF THE

COUNTRY AND IS THE PRIMARY ACCESS ROUTE TO NORTH VIET NAM . WITH THE

PLAINE DES JARRES IN THEIR HANDS, THE REDS COULD SOLIDIFY THEIR HOLD ON

ALL OF NORTHERN LAOS . LAST WEEK THIS GLOOMY PROSPECT WAS ALL BUT A

FACT, AS 10,000 RED TROOPS POURED ONTO THE PLAIN, FORCING THE

NEUTRALISTS TO ITS VERY EDGE . CIGARETTES & BULLETS . THE WEEK BEGAN

WITH A DESPERATE FLIGHT TO THE PLAIN BY NEUTRALIST PREMIER SOUVANNA

PHOUMA, WHO HOPED IT STILL MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO ARRANGE A CEASE-FIRE

BETWEEN THE COMMUNIST PATHET LAO AND NEUTRALIST ARMY CHIEF KONG LE .

THINGS SEEMED CHEERY ENOUGH AS THE OPPOSING LEADERS EMBRACED AND THEIR

TROOPS EXCHANGED CIGARETTES . BUT, AS ONE NEUTRALIST PUT IT, " WE

EXCHANGE CIGARETTES DURING THE DAY AND BULLETS AT NIGHT . " ALL TOO

TRUE . HARDLY HAD SOUVANNA DEPARTED WHEN THE TRUCE ABRUPTLY COLLAPSED .

NO ONE KNOWS WHO FIRED FIRST, BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN THE PATHET LAO WAS

SHOOTING, AND THE NEUTRALISTS WERE RUNNING . ON THE DUSTY PLAINE DES

JARRES AIRSTRIP, MOTHERS BREASTFED DIRTY BABIES, AND CHILDREN SAGGED

UNDER THE WEIGHT OF PARACHUTE PACKS CRAMMED WITH HOUSEHOLD BELONGINGS

AS THEY PATIENTLY WAITED FOR PLANES TO EVACUATE THEM TO THE LAOTIAN

CAPITAL OF VIENTIANE, 120 MILES AWAY . IN HIS RAMSHACKLE, TIN-ROOFED

HEADQUARTERS, GUARDED NIGHT AND DAY BY A PATROLLING PLATOON OF TANKS,

KONG LE WORKED ROUND THE CLOCK DRAWING UP A BATTLE PLAN, ALTHOUGH

WEAKENED BY A LIVER AILMENT AND A SERIOUS SINUS CONDITION . " THIS, "

HE SAID, " IS THE FINAL SHOWDOWN . " MOVING OVER THE MOUNTAINTOPS AND

THROUGH THE PASSES GIRDLING THE PLAIN, THE REDS AT LAST SURROUNDED THE

SIX-MILE-LONG PLATEAU . FROM THE HEIGHTS, THE COMMUNISTS LAID A MORTAR

BARRAGE ON THE AIRFIELD, KONG LE'S LAST REMAINING LIFELINE TO VIENTIANE

. WITH THE AIRSTRIP INOPERABLE, KONG LE WAS FORCED TO RELY ON RUNNERS

AS HIS PRIMARY MEANS OF COMMUNICATION ; HE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO PULL

TOGETHER WHAT WAS LEFT OF HIS SHATTERED FORCES AND MOVE OFF THE PLAIN .

PRESSURE FROM TWO QUARTERS . KONG LE'S RETREAT CAUSED CONSTERNATION IN

VIENTIANE . WITH HIS LEFT-RIGHT-CENTER COALITION FAST COMING UNSTUCK,

PREMIER SOUVANNA PHOUMA WAS FEARFUL THAT KONG LE'S TROOPS WOULD JOIN

FORCES WITH A RIGHT-WING ARMY JUST SOUTHWEST OF THE PLAINE DES JARRES

AND LAUNCH A JOINT COUNTERATTACK AGAINST THE REDS THAT WOULD SURELY

PRECIPITATE CIVIL WAR . DESPERATELY HE APPEALED TO BRITAIN AND RUSSIA,

OVERSEERS OF THE GENEVA AGREEMENT, FOR QUICK INTERVENTION TO STOP THE

PATHET LAO'S FLAGRANT VIOLATIONS OF THE CEASE-FIRE . RUSSIA HESITATED

TO INTERCEDE, FOR FEAR OF ALIENATING THE COMMUNISTS IN LAOS AND NORTH

VIET NAM . SOVIET INTERVENTION AT THIS STAGE MIGHT TURN THEM

INCREASINGLY TOWARD RED CHINA, RUSSIA'S RIVAL, FOR SUPPORT IN THEIR

REVOLUTION . BUT NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV WAS ALSO UNDER PRESSURE FROM A

DIFFERENT QUARTER . IN WASHINGTON, PRESIDENT KENNEDY MADE IT CLEAR THAT

HE EXPECTED MOSCOW TO PUT A STOP TO PATHET LAO PRESSURE AND LIVE UP TO

THE GENEVA AGREEMENT . " WE WILL, I THINK, HAVE A CHANCE TO SEE IN THE

NEXT FEW DAYS WHETHER WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A DESTRUCTION OF THAT ACCORD

WHETHER THE SOVIET UNION AND OTHER SIGNATORIES ARE GOING TO MEET THEIR

OBLIGATIONS, " SAID KENNEDY . TOUGHER U.S . ACTION COULD NOT BE RULED

OUT IF THE COMMUNISTS SHOWED SIGNS OF MOVING SOUTH FROM THE PLAINE DES

JARRES INTO THE MEKONG RIVER VALLEY ITSELF . THIS WOULD STRENGTHEN

THEIR SUPPLY ROUTES TO COMMUNIST GUERRILLAS FIGHTING IN NEIGHBORING

SOUTH VIET NAM, WHERE THE U.S . IS DEEPLY COMMITTED WITH BOTH MEN AND

MONEY . THOUGH THE STATE DEPARTMENT DREADED THE THOUGHT OF ANY FURTHER

MILITARY INVOLVEMENT IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, OFFICIALS MADE IT CLEAR THAT

MORE TROOPS MIGHT BE BROUGHT INTO THE AREA TO SAFEGUARD LAOTIAN

NEUTRALITY .

SOUTH VIET NAM THE GREAT EMANCIPATOR FOR MORE THAN A YEAR, THE

U.S . HAS BEEN URGING SOUTH VIET NAM'S PRESIDENT NGO DINH DIEM TO

DECLARE A GENERAL AMNESTY FOR COMMUNIST VIET CONG GUERRILLAS IN ORDER

TO ENCOURAGE WHOLESALE DESERTIONS FROM THE RED CAUSE . DIEM WAS IN

FAVOR OF THE IDEA . BUT HE ALWAYS REPLIED THAT AS ABRAHAM LINCOLN

WAITED TWO YEARS AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE CIVIL WAR BEFORE ISSUING

HIS EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION, HE, TOO, WOULD WAIT FOR A PROPITIOUS

MOMENT SO THAT THE MOVE COULD NOT BE INTERPRETED AS A DESPERATE GESTURE

BY A SINKING GOVERNMENT TO ROUND UP POPULAR SUPPORT . LAST WEEK,

CONFIDENT THAT THE WAR AGAINST THE REDS HAD TAKEN A TURN FOR THE

BETTER, DIEM FINALLY PROCLAIMED AN " OPEN ARMS " CLEMENCY PROGRAM .

DIEM'S DECLARATION WAS SPEEDED BY THE ENCOURAGING RESULTS OF AN

INFORMAL GOVERNMENT CLEMENCY PROGRAM IN EFFECT SINCE FEBRUARY THAT HAS

CAUSED THE DEFECTION OF MORE THAN 2,700 VIET CONG FOLLOWERS, INCLUDING

SEVERAL MINOR RED OFFICIALS . UNDER THE TERMS OF THE NEW PROCLAMATION,

RED DEFECTORS " WILL BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO REFORM AND REDEEM

THEMSELVES BY DEEDS, AND DEPENDING ON THESE DEEDS, WILL BE ENTITLED TO

LIGHTER SENTENCES OR BE ABSOLVED OF PAST OFFENSES . " BUT THE OFFER OF

AMNESTY APPLIES ONLY TO VIET CONG SYMPATHIZERS AND NOT TO HARD-CORE

COMMUNIST CADRES, WHO, DIEM FEELS, ARE INCAPABLE OF REHABILITATION .

DIEM'S ANNOUNCEMENT CAME ON THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE START OF HIS

GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGIC HAMLET PROGRAM, UNDER WHICH 59 PER CENT OF THE

SOUTH VIETNAMESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN BROUGHT INTO VILLAGES SURROUNDED BY

MOATS AND BAMBOO FENCES . AS IF IN CELEBRATION OF THE EVENT, GOVERNMENT

FORCES BEAT BACK A VIOLENT VIET CONG ATTACK AGAINST A NETWORK OF

VILLAGES AROUND THE CITY OF QUANGNGAI, SOME 250 MILES NORTHEAST OF

SAIGON, WHERE THE GOVERNMENT SET UP A SUCCESSFUL FORTIFIED VILLAGE

COMPLEX IN AN AREA THAT THE REDS HAD PREVIOUSLY CONTROLLED . DEPARTING

FROM THE USUAL COMMUNIST HIT-AND-RUN TACTICS, A BATTALION OF REDS

ATTACKED THE HAMLETS UNDER COVER OF DARKNESS, DROVE TO THE EDGE OF THE

U.S . MILITARY COMPOUND IN THE CITY WITH A GRENADE ASSAULT BEFORE BEING

DRIVEN BACK . " IT TOOK TWO DAYS FOR THE GOVERNMENT FORCES TO STAMP OUT

THE FIRE, " SAID ONE U.S . OFFICIAL . " AFTER THAT, THEY MANAGED TO

GAIN THE INITIATIVE, AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE KEEPING . /

ITALY FANFANI'S TEST ALONG THE GRAND CANAL IN VENICE, A HUGE,

BRIGHTLY LIT RED-AND-WHITE SHIELD OF THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY

GLEAMS IN THE NIGHT ; SPROUTING FROM ROME'S JANICULUM HILL,

OVERLOOKING THE VATICAN, IS THE RED-WHITE-GREEN FLAME OF THE TINY,

POWERLESS FASCISTS . FROM MESSINA TO MILAN LAST WEEK, WIDE PIAZZAS AND

NARROW ALLEYWAYS SPROUTED IN RIOTOUS CAMPAIGN COLORS, AND ECHOED WITH

THE LOUDSPEAKER SLOGANS OF SCUDDING LITTLE FIAT 600S, AS ITALY'S

34,300,000 VOTERS PREPARED TO GO TO THE POLLS FOR THE FIRST NATIONAL

ELECTION IN FIVE YEARS . THE ELECTION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SINCE 1948,

WHEN THE COMMUNISTS WERE DEFEATED IN A CRUCIAL BID FOR POWER . THE

THREAT OF A RED TAKEOVER HAS LONG SINCE FADED ; THIS TIME THE MAIN

ISSUE IS CONTINUATION OF THE APERTURA A SINISTRA (OPENING TO THE LEFT),

PREMIER AMINTORE FANFANI'S YEAR-OLD EXPERIMENT IN PARLIAMENTARY

COOPERATION WITH THE LEFT-WING SOCIALISTS . MIXED BLESSING . THE DEAL

HAS GIVEN FANFANI THE NECESSARY MAJORITY TO INTRODUCE A LONG LIST OF

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REFORMS ; IT ALSO PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR

ISOLATING THE REDS BY FINALLY BREAKING THEIR HOLD ON PIETRO NENNI'S

SOCIALISTS . BUT THE APERTURA ALSO OPENS THE WAY TO FAR-REACHING

GOVERNMENT PLANNING AND HIGHER TAXES, BOTH OF WHICH ARE STRONGLY

OPPOSED BY LARGE AND SMALL BUSINESSMEN ; PERHAPS SIGNIFICANTLY,

LIBERAL PARTY LEADER GIOVANNI MALAGODI, AN ECONOMIC CONSERVATIVE WHO

SHARPLY CRITICIZES FANFANI'S FLIRTATION WITH THE LEFT, HAS BEEN DRAWING

LARGE AND ENTHUSIASTIC CROWDS . ANOTHER ANXIETY CREATED BY THE

CENTER-LEFT COALITION IS THAT NEUTRALIST NENNI WILL WEAKEN ITALY'S

TIES TO THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE . THESE FEARS COULD COST FANFANI'S

CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS AS MANY AS 1,000,000 VOTES . AS ALWAYS, THE VATICAN

IS A HOT CAMPAIGN ISSUE ; THIS TIME, POPE JOHN HAS MADE IT HOTTER THAN

USUAL BY MEETING ALEKSEI ADZHUBEI, NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV'S SON-IN-LAW, LAST

MONTH, AND OTHERWISE ESTABLISHING FRIENDLIER RELATIONS WITH THE KREMLIN

. FORTNIGHT AGO, THE COMMUNIST NEWSPAPER L'UNITA EXAGGERATED POPE

JOHN'S RECENT PACEM IN TERRIS ENCYCLICAL AS AN " AN APPEAL FOR PEACE

BASED ON NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT . " THIS PROMPTED A PROGOVERNMENT

NEWSPAPER TO CRACK THAT THE REDS WERE SUDDENLY " MORE PAPIST THAN THE

POPE . " IN FACT, THE VATICAN IS QUIETLY BACKING FANFANI'S CHRISTIAN

DEMOCRATIC-SOCIALIST PARTNERSHIP, THOUGH PUBLICLY IT HAS STEERED A

NEUTRAL COURSE ; THIS TIME, FOR EXAMPLE, PARISH PRIESTS ARE NOT SAYING

THAT TO VOTE FOR THE SOCIALISTS IS A GRAVE SIN . USEFUL VISIT . ANOTHER

JOHN WHO CASTS HIS SHADOW OVER THE CAMPAIGN IS JOHN F . KENNEDY . THE

U.S . HAS SMOOTHLY SHIFTED ITS SUPPORT AWAY FROM CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC

RIGHT-WINGERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE THE APERTURA, NOW FAVORS

FANFANI'S COALITION . ONE GROUP OF FANFANI SUPPORTERS IS DUBBED THE "

KENNEDIANI, " AND THE PREMIER, DASHING ABOUT THE COUNTRYSIDE IN A BLACK

LANCIA, REPEATEDLY RECALLS FOR TOWNSFOLK HIS RECENT VISIT TO WASHINGTON

AS EVIDENCE OF ITALY'S HIGH STANDING WITH THE U.S . FOR CAMPAIGN

PURPOSES EVEN FANFANI'S SOCIALIST ALLIES HAVE BEEN WARMING TO THE U.S .

ASKED A SOCIALIST SPEAKER, CONFIDENT OF AN AFFIRMATIVE ANSWER FROM A

CROWD IN BOLOGNA'S PIAZZA MATTEOTTI : " IF KENNEDY WERE IN ITALY,

WOULD HE NOT SUPPORT THE OPENING TO THE LEFT ? " PERHAPS HE WOULD .

WEST GERMANY AN ECLIPSE OF PRINCES WHEN BRITAIN'S PRINCE

PHILIP AND HIS DAUGHTER, PRINCESS ANNE, 12, CLAMBERED OUT OF THEIR

RASPBERRY-PINK ROYAL PLANE AT FRANKFURT LAST WEEK, THERE WERE NO

TOPHATTED OFFICIALS TO WELCOME THEM OR RESPECTFUL CROWDS CHEERING " ES

LEBE HOCH .! " AFTER GREETING THEIR WAITING COUSINS, PRINCE LUDWIG

AND PRINCESS MARGARET VON HESSEN, PHILIP AND ANNE GOT QUICKLY INTO THE

RAKISH ALVIS SPORTS COUPE, WHICH HAD BEEN FLOWN AHEAD OF THE ROYAL

PARTY FROM LONDON . THEN THEY HEADED DOWN THE AUTOBAHN TO DARMSTADT,

WHERE THEY STAYED AT THE VON HESSENS' PALATIAL 18TH CENTURY SCHLOSS

WOLFSGARTEN . THE BRITISH VISITORS' FOUR-DAY STAY MADE LITTLE STIR IN

WEST GERMANY AS A WHOLE, BUT THEIR PRESENCE WORKED LIKE CHAMPAGNE ON

THE ARISTOCRACY'S BATTERED MORALE . IN A SOCIETY WHERE MOST BLUEBLOODS

FEEL THAT THEY ARE DISPLACED PERSONAGES (THERE HASN'T BEEN A KAISER

SINCE 1918), THE ROMANTIK OF A ROYAL VISIT IS RARE INDEED . THANKS TO

THE NATION'S MIRACULOUS ECONOMIC BOOM, WEST GERMANS TODAY ARE MORE

CONCERNED WITH PAYCHECKS THAN WITH PRINCELY COMINGS AND GOINGS . BUT

THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION HAS FAILED NOTABLY TO

PRODUCE A UNIFIED, NATIONAL FUHRUNGSSCHICHT (LEADERSHIP LAYER) IN PLACE

OF THE OLD ARISTOCRATIC RULING CASTE . THE RESULT IS A CONFUSED AND

CONFUSING SOCIETY IN WHICH, SAYS SOCIOLOGIST RALF DAHRENDORF, THERE IS

NOT ONE CLASS OF PROMINENZ BUT " A MULTITUDE OF COMPETING GROUPS . "

THE " PYRAMIDS OF POWER " INCLUDE THE CHURCH, THE MILITARY, LOCAL

GOVERNMENT AND SUCH VENERABLE UNIVERSITIES AS TUBINGEN, GOTTINGEN AND

HEIDELBERG, WHERE A HERR PROFESSOR COMMANDS UNDIMINISHED RESPECT FROM

THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE . SALON FROM FORD ? BY FAR THE MOST POWERFUL

AND CONSPICUOUS ELITE IN PRESENT-DAY GERMANY IS, OF COURSE, THE

GELDARISTOKRATIE, THE NEW INDUSTRIAL PLUTOCRACY WHOSE YELLOW MERCEDESES

AND CHRIS-CRAFT CRUISERS HAVE LARGELY REPLACED THE IRON CROSS AND THE

DUELING SCAR AS STATUS SYMBOLS . THE NEW UPPER CRUST IS PERSONIFIED BY

SUCH TYCOONS AS RUDOLF AUGUST OETKER, WHO PARLAYED A BAKING POWDER

BUSINESS INTO A 100-COMPANY EMPIRE ; HANS GUNTHER SOHL, WHO AS BOSS OF

THYSSEN SINCE WAR'S END HAS TURNED A FAMILY IRONWORKS INTO WEST

GERMANY'S BIGGEST STEELMAKER ; AND MUNICH'S RUDOLF MUNEMANN, ONE OF

THE NATION'S BIGGEST AND BOLDEST FINANCIERS . YET, FOR ALL ITS WEALTH,

SAYS SOCIOLOGIST DAHRENDORF, THE GELDARISTOKRATIE " IS SEARCHING ABOVE

ITSELF IN THE SOCIAL HIERARCHY FOR ITS BEHAVIORAL STANDARDS . BUT THE

SPACE ABOVE IT IS EMPTY . " THIS, HE SUGGESTS, ACCOUNTS FOR THE

JOYLESS, FRANTIC MATERIALISM THAT CHARACTERIZES MUCH OF POSTWAR GERMAN

LIFE " THE MEDIEVAL CHOIR STALL IN THE DINING ROOM, THE CONSPICUOUS

CONSUMPTION, THE COMPLETE LACK OF TASTE IN ART AND LITERATURE . "

COMPLAINS ONE SOPHISTICATED YOUNG PRINCESS : " IF THE FORD FOUNDATION

REALLY WANTS TO DO SOMETHING FOR GERMANY, IT SHOULD ENDOW A SALON IN

BONN . JUST A LITTLE SALON . THE OLD SOCIETY IS DEAD NOW . " VONS IN

KEPT FOR HUNTING PARTIES) ; AT DINNER, HIS LIVERIED CHIEF HUNTSMAN

STATIONS HIMSELF BEHIND THE COUNT'S CHAIR TO SUMMON A FOOTMAN WHENEVER

HIS MASTER'S WINEGLASS IS EMPTY . PRINCE EMICH ZU LEININGEN, 36, WHOSE

ESCUTCHEON IS AT LEAST 880 YEARS OLD, IS A GLOBE-TROTTING BIG-GAME

HUNTER WHO HONED HIS MARKSMANSHIP AS A YOUTH BY TAKING POTSHOTS AT

FAMILY PORTRAITS IN HIS HANDSOME BAROQUE PALACE AT AMORBACH . MANY OLD

BAVARIAN FAMILIES STUBBORNLY RESISTED THE NAZIS AND WERE SINGLED OUT

FOR PERSECUTION BY HITLER ; AFTER THE WAR, THEY WERE ABLE TO RECLAIM

THEIR CONFISCATED HOLDINGS INTACT, AND EVER SINCE HAVE MANAGED TO KEEP

THE BOAR FROM THE DOOR WITH CONSPICUOUS SUCCESS . ONE OF THEIR

LIVELIEST MEMBERS IS HANDSOME PRINCE " ALFIE " AUERSPERG, WHO WAS DOWN

#$ BOOST), PORTAL-TO-PORTAL PAY BETWEEN THE VINEYARD AND HOME, AND TWO

NOT ONE DAILY CIGARS, THE SLANG WORD FOR THE WORKERS' TRADITIONAL

20-MINUTE SIESTA . THE STRIKE WAS THE LATEST AND BIGGEST IN A WAVE OF

LABOR UNREST THAT HAS SWEPT DICTATOR FRANCISCO FRANCO'S SPAIN THIS

SPRING . IN BARCELONA THE HISPANO SUIZA AIRPLANE-ENGINE PLANT RECENTLY

LAID OFF 150 EMPLOYEES FOLLOWING A SERIES OF WORK SLOWDOWNS, WAS FORCED

TO HIRE THEM BACK WHEN 2,000 OLIVETTI FACTORY EMPLOYEES THREATENED A

SYMPATHY WALKOUT . TWO SITDOWN STRIKES IN A SINGLE WEEK DISRUPTED WORK

IN A SEVILLE TEXTILE PLANT . SIX HUNDRED MADRID METALWORKERS HAVE BEEN

THREATENING SIMILAR TROUBLE AFTER STUBBORNLY REFUSING TO SIGN A NEW

CONTRACT . AID FROM THE PRIESTS . THE COMPLAINTS ARE MANY, FOR THE

SPANISH WORKER PUTS IN LONGER HOURS FOR LESS PAY THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER

WORKER IN WESTERN EUROPE, AND STRIKES ARE LEGALLY BANNED . WHEN EL

CAUDILLO GRANTED SUBSTANTIAL WAGE BOOSTS FOR THE 60,000 STRIKING

ASTURIAS COAL MINERS LAST SUMMER, HE MERELY WHETTED THE APPETITES OF

WORKERS IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY ; ANOTHER INCREASE LAST JAN . 1,

RAISING UNSKILLED LABORERS FROM A MINIMUM 60 #$ TO $1 PER DAY, DID NOT

HELP THE MILLIONS OF SKILLED WORKERS ABOVE THIS MEAGER FLOOR . OPENLY

BACKING THE LATEST WAVE OF STRIKES ARE THE PRIESTS OF THE WORKERS'

BROTHERHOODS OF CATHOLIC ACTION AND SEVERAL SMALL BUT EFFECTIVE

CATHOLIC LAY ORGANIZATIONS THAT REGULARLY BLAST THE CAUDILLO'S TIGHT

CONTROLS ON WORKERS FROM BENEATH THE SHELTERING WING OF THE CHURCH .

ONE SUCH GROUP, THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN WORKERS, PUBLISHES AN UNCENSORED

AND OUTSPOKEN MONTHLY BULLETIN, JUVENTUD OBRERA, THAT DEMANDS FREE,

WESTERN-STYLE LABOR UNIONS, LASHES OUT AT THE ANACHRONISTIC SINDICATOS,

WHICH FIX PRICES AND WAGES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY . SAID JOURNAL EDITOR

FRANCISCO GUERRERO, 25, DESCRIBING HIS MISSION LAST WEEK : " OUR WORK

IS GOD'S ANSWER TO THE EVIL NEGATION OF ALL HUMAN VALUES . IT IS THE

ONLY SALVATION FOR SPAIN'S MASSES, OPPRESSED FROM ABOVE (BY FRANCO) AND

MENACED FROM BELOW (BY THE COMMUNISTS) . " A TRIP TO CADIZ . SUCH FRANK

TALK HAS THE REGIME SERIOUSLY WORRIED, AND A FEW OF THE MORE

PROGRESSIVE MEMBERS OF FRANCO'S AUTHORITARIAN REGIME ARE ANXIOUSLY

TRYING TO IMPROVE LABOR CONDITIONS . THE LABOR MINISTRY IS PREPARING A

BILL TO LEGALIZE " LABOR " STRIKES (AS DISTINCT FROM " POLITICAL "

STRIKES) . ANOTHER MEASURE OF THE REGIME'S CONCERN WAS THE SWIFT

SETTLEMENT OF LAST WEEK'S TROUBLE AMONG THE VINEYARD WORKERS OF

SANLUCAR AND JEREZ . AS SOON AS WORD OF THE WORK STOPPAGE WAS FLASHED

TO MADRID, A LABOR MINISTRY OFFICIAL RACED TO CADIZ AND PRESSURED

VINEYARD EMPLOYERS INTO BOWING TO MOST OF THE WORKER DEMANDS, INCLUDING

MORE CENTIMOS AS WELL AS THE SECOND CIGAR . TROUBLE WAS OVER FOR THE

MOMENT . BUT WORRIED FRANCO AIDES KNOW THAT DOZENS OF IMPORTANT WAGE

CONTRACTS IN MANY INDUSTRIES ARE UP FOR RENEWAL DURING THE COMING WEEKS

. UNLESS PAY BOOSTS ARE GRANTED PROMPTLY, SPAIN IS ALMOST CERTAINLY IN

FOR A SERIOUS NATION-WIDE WAVE OF STRIKES THIS SUMMER .

DEATH AT DAWN JULIAN GRIMAU GARCIA WAS 25 AND A DETECTIVE IN

MADRID WHEN THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR BROKE OUT IN 1936 . BUT HE WAS ALSO A

MEMBER OF THE SPANISH COMMUNIST PARTY, AND HIS PROFESSIONAL POLICE

TRAINING SOON LANDED HIM A KEY JOB IN THE RED APPARATUS . HE BECAME

CHIEF OF " CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS " FOR MADRID, VALENCIA AND

BARCELONA, FERRETING OUT SUPPORTERS OF FRANCISCO FRANCO . PART OF

GRIMAU'S JOB WAS TO SERVE ON KANGAROO COURTS, CALLED CHEKAS (AFTER THE

ONETIME INITIALS OF THE SOVIET SECRET POLICE), WHICH ORDERED DOZENS OF

SUMMARY DEATH SENTENCES DURING THE BRUTAL THREE-YEAR WAR . AFTER THE

REPUBLICAN COLLAPSE GRIMAU FLED, WORKED AS A COMMUNIST AGENT IN

CZECHOSLOVAKIA, RUSSIA, MEXICO AND CUBA . A MEMBER OF THE CENTRAL

COMMITTEE OF THE OUTLAWED SPANISH COMMUNIST PARTY, HE WAS LIVING IN

FRANCE WHEN HE SLIPPED ACROSS THE FRONTIER IN 1959 TO REORGANIZE THE

SPANISH COMMUNIST UNDERGROUND . AFTER SEVERAL TRIPS IN AND OUT OF SPAIN

SINCE 1959, AN INFORMER GAVE HIM AWAY TO POLICE IN MADRID LAST NOVEMBER

. FRANCO'S COPS CLAPPED HIM IN JAIL AND BEGAN A LENGTHY INTERROGATION .

DURING ONE SESSION, GRIMAU LEAPED, FELL, OR WAS PUSHED FROM A

FIRST-FLOOR WINDOW, FRACTURING HIS SKULL AND BOTH ARMS . LAST WEEK,

WITH A LARGE DENT IN HIS FOREHEAD, GAUNT, BALDING GRIMAU HEARD A

SEVEN-MAN MILITARY COURT TICK OFF THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM ; THEY

RANGED FROM " CONTINUING MILITARY REBELLION " TO ARSON, TORTURE AND

EXECUTION OF ANTI-REPUBLICANS BY THE CHEKAS 25 YEARS AGO . THE MAXIMUM

PENALTY WAS DEATH . DID HE CARE TO SAY SOMETHING BEFORE SENTENCE WAS

PASSED ONLY THIS, " REPLIED GRIMAU . " SINCE 1936, I HAVE LIVED THE

LIFE OF A COMMUNIST . I WILL DIE A COMMUNIST . " THEN HE TOOK HIS SEAT

AND LISTENED INTENTLY AS THE COURT PRONOUNCED THE SENTENCE EVERYONE

EXPECTED DEATH . THIS WAS THE CUE FOR COMMUNIST DEMONSTRATIONS IN HALF

A DOZEN WEST EUROPEAN CITIES ; NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV, NO STRANGER TO

EXECUTIONS, HAD THE GALL TO SEND A PERSONAL APPEAL FOR CLEMENCY TO

FRANCO . GRIMAU'S WIFE VAINLY URGED PRESIDENT KENNEDY TO INTERVENE .

THE INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE ONLY STIFFENED THE REGIME'S DETERMINATION TO

CARRY OUT THE PENALTY . AT A MEETING WITH HIS CABINET, FRANCO UPHELD

THE SENTENCE . NEXT DAY AT DAWN, GRIMAU, PALE BUT COMPOSED, WAS LED

INTO THE COURTYARD OF CARABANCHEL PRISON JUST OUTSIDE MADRID . HE

WALKED ALONE TO THE WALL, REFUSED A BLINDFOLD, SHOUTED " VIVA EL

COMMUNISMO " , AND THEN COLLAPSED UNDER A VOLLEY OF SHOTS FIRED BY

SPANISH MOROCCAN TROOPS .

GHANA DEALING WITH ENEMIES DURING HIS SIX YEARS AS GHANA'S BOSS,

PRESIDENT KWAME NKRUMAH HAS DEALT WITH HIS OPPOSITION IN A VARIETY OF

WAYS INTIMIDATION, JAIL, EXILE . LAST WEEK HE WENT A STEP FURTHER . IN

A PACKED COURTROOM IN ACCRA, WHERE MINE DETECTORS WERE USED TO CHECK

SPECTATORS FOR WEAPONS, AN NKRUMAH-CREATED TRIBUNAL PASSED OUT DEATH

SENTENCES TO FIVE ENEMIES OF THE REGIME . THE FIVE MEN, FOUR GHANAIANS

AND A NIGERIAN, WERE CHARGED WITH TREASON IN CONNECTION WITH HALF A

DOZEN EXPLOSIONS THAT KILLED 35 PERSONS AND INJURED 300 . THE BOMBING

BEGAN LAST AUGUST, WHEN THE BLAST OF A HAND GRENADE WOUNDED OSAGYEFO IN

THE SHOULDER AS HE DROVE BY IN HIS RUSSIAN-MADE CHAIKA LIMOUSINE NEAR

THE NORTHERN BORDER VILLAGE OF KULUNGUGU . NKRUMAH'S COPS HAVE BEEN

ROUNDING UP SUSPECTS EVER SINCE . AS THE FIVE-WEEK TRIAL DRAGGED ON,

ONE OF THE DEFENDANTS, NIGERIAN IMMIGRANT MALAM MAMA TULA, 44,

TESTIFIED THAT THE REAL BRAINS BEHIND THE KULUNGUGU ATTEMPT WERE THREE

MEN WHO HAD BEEN NKRUMAH'S CLOSEST CRONIES, EX-FOREIGN MINISTER AKO

ADJEI, EX-INFORMATION MINISTER TAWIA ADAMAFIO, AND H . H .

COFIE-CRABBE, FORMER EXECUTIVE SECRETARY OF NKRUMAH'S OWN CONVENTION

PEOPLE'S PARTY . MAMA TULA SAID THAT THE TRIO CONFERRED WITH THE BOMB

THROWERS AT A VILLAGE HIDEOUT, SUPPLIED EIGHT BRITISH-MADE GRENADES AND

PROMISED A $560 BOUNTY IF NKRUMAH WAS KILLED . THE THREE HAVE BEEN IN

PRISON UNDER THE PREVENTIVE DETENTION ACT SINCE LAST AUGUST . ONE OF

THE FOUR OTHER TREASON DEFENDANTS BESIDE MAMA TULA IN THE DOCK, TEIKO

TAGOE, 20, READILY ADMITTED TO POSSESSION OF A LIVE HAND GRENADE AT A

MEETING OF NKRUMAH'S PARTY LAST JANUARY . ANOTHER, JOSEPH QUAYE MENSAH,

57, OWNED UP TO MAILING THE REDEEMER AN ANONYMOUS LETTER WARNING, "

DEAR DR., THIS IS TO INFORM YOU I AM STILL CHASING YOU UNTIL I . . .

HAVE YOU KILLED, " BUT PLEADED THAT HE WAS ONLY TRYING TO SCARE NKRUMAH

. WHEN THE TESTIMONY ENDED, THE THREE WIHITE-WIGGED JUDGES FILED OUT,

SPENT ANOTHER TWO WEEKS PREPARING A 6,000-WORD DECISION THEY RETURNED

LAST WEEK, THE CHIEF JUSTICE PAUSED SOMBERLY TO DON A BLACK CAP BEFORE

PRONOUNCING SENTENCE, SIGNAL THAT THE VERDICT WOULD BE DEATH BY HANGING

THE CONGO THE BATTLE OF JADOTVILLE IT BEGAN LIKE THE

MONTAGUES AND THE CAPULETS . HE WAS A LUNDA BOY WHO WANTED TO MARRY A

BALUBA GIRL, BUT THE TWO TRIBES WERE ANCIENT BLOOD FOES . LAST WEEK, IN

THE KATANGA TOWN OF JADOTVILLE, THEIR LOVE AFFAIR RESULTED IN A SAVAGE

ORGY OF KILLING UNLIKE ANY EVER SEEN ON THE STREETS OF VERONA . BANDS

OF LUNDA NATIVES, ARMED WITH KNIVES, MACHETES, AND RAZOR-SHARP BICYCLE

CHAINS LASHED TO STICKS, STORMED THROUGH THE STREETS LOOKING FOR BALUBA

YOUTHS WEARING MONKEY FUR HEADPIECES AND ANIMAL-SKIN WAR DRESSES . BOTH

SIDES CHASED TERRIFIED POLICE OUT OF NATIVE QUARTERS, BRUSHED ASIDE THE

PLEAS OF KATANGA'S PRESIDENT MOISE TSHOMBE WHEN HE ARRIVED IN THE CITY

BEGGING FOR THE CARNAGE TO STOP . AS THE SLAUGHTER RAGED UNCHECKED,

WHITE CHILDREN WERE EVACUATED FROM THE CITY TO A NEARBY METHODIST

MISSION . FROM NEIGHBORING NORTHERN RHODESIA, BLOOD WAS FLOWN IN TO

MEET THE NEEDS OF THE JADOTVILLE HOSPITAL, WHERE DOCTORS AND NURSES

WORKED NONSTOP FOR MORE THAN 48 HOURS TRYING TO PATCH UP A STEADY

STREAM OF WOUNDED AND DYING . MANY VICTIMS WERE MAIMED BEYOND

RECOGNITION . " A DOCTOR LIFTED A BANDAGE OFF ONE MAN'S HEAD, " SAID A

WITNESS . " A LARGE PIECE HAD BEEN SLICED OUT OF HIS SKULL LIKE A SLICE

FROM AN ORANGE, AND I COULD SEE HIS BRAIN PULSATING . " AFTER FOUR DAYS

OF BLOODSHED, THE RIOTING FINALLY PETERED OUT, AND CAUTIOUS UNITED

NATIONS TROOPS, WHO HAD NOT DARED INTERVENE WHILE THE FIGHTING WAS AT

ITS HEIGHT, MOVED IN AND TOTED UP THE FRIGHTFUL COST . THE TOLL : AT

LEAST 70 DEAD, AND SCORES INJURED .

CROWDS SWARMED THROUGH JERUSALEM AND TOWNS ON THE WEST BANK OF THE

JORDAN RIVER, SHOOTING OFF RIFLES AND TOMMY GUNS AND DEMANDING

IMMEDIATE MERGER WITH NASSER'S PROJECTED FEDERATION . KING HUSSEIN

CALLED OUT DESERT TROOPS AND POLICE REINFORCEMENTS, CLAMPED AN

EMERGENCY CURFEW ON THE HOLY CITY . IN THE CAPITAL CITY OF AMMAN,

SHOUTING STUDENTS CARRYING ARAB UNITY FLAGS WITH A FOURTH STAR FOR

JORDAN WERE PEACEFULLY DISPERSED, BUT ARMORED CARS WARILY PATROLLED THE

STREETS . A FEW HOURS LATER, IN A STORMY DEBATE IN AMMAN'S HOUSE OF

REPRESENTATIVES, 32 OF THE 60 LEGISLATORS ROSE TO ATTACK THE POLICIES

OF PRIME MINISTER SAMIR RIFAI, WHOM HUSSEIN HAD APPOINTED ONLY 24 DAYS

EARLIER . RIFAI WAS IN FAVOR OF LINKING JORDAN WITH NASSER'S GROUP, BUT

WANTED TO TAKE HIS TIME ABOUT IT . THE PARLIAMENTARIANS DID NOT WANT TO

WAIT . AFTER NINE HOURS OF IT, RIFAI STORMED OUT OF THE CHAMBER, HANDED

HIS RESIGNATION TO KING HUSSEIN .

THEY'RE OFF ONLY SIX WEEKS AGO, MOST BRITISH POLITICIANS

BELIEVED THAT PRIME MINISTER HAROLD MACMILLAN'S GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT

DARE CALL A GENERAL ELECTION BEFORE SPRING 1964 . BUT IN WESTMINSTER

LAST WEEK M.P.S WERE WAGERING THAT THE TORIES WOULD GO TO THE PEOPLE

THIS FALL . LABOR PARTY LEADERS EVEN CLAIMED TO KNOW THE DATE : OCT .

24, ABOUT THE LAST POSSIBLE THURSDAY (BRITAIN'S TRADITIONAL POLLING

DAY) BEFORE THE END OF CAMPAIGNING SEASON . REASON FOR THE SHIFT IN

THINKING WAS THE GOOD ECONOMIC NEWS FOR THE GOVERNMENT THAT CAME WITH

SPRING'S THAW AFTER THE WORST WINTER OF THE CENTURY . SUDDENLY CAME

WORD OF NEW EXPORT RECORDS, BOOMING RETAIL SALES AND SWELLING COMPANY

PROFITS . MOST WELCOME NEWS OF ALL LAST WEEK WAS THAT THE REMORSELESS

FIVE-MONTH RISE IN UNEMPLOYMENT HAD FINALLY DRIFTED DOWN TO 604,000,

OFF NEARLY 100,000 FROM THE MARCH FIGURE . PROMISES & THREATS . THE

TORIES STILL FACED A LONG, HAZARDOUS HAUL . POLITICALLY AND

ECONOMICALLY, THE BIGGEST ROADBLOCK IS THAT INDUSTRY WILL NOT BE ABLE

TO EXPAND AND COMPETE IN WORLD MARKETS WITHOUT VIGOROUS, UNPOPULAR

MEASURES TO HOLD WAGE BOOSTS TO HALF THEIR RATE OF INCREASE OVER THE

PAST DECADE . ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, ECONOMISTS NOW BELIEVE THAT, BY FALL,

CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER REGINALD MAUDLING'S CANNY BUDGET (TIME,

APRIL 12) WILL HAVE BOOSTED PRODUCTION, WHITTLED UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUT

EXTRA SPENDING MONEY IN LOWER-INCOME POCKETS . IN FACT, MANY TORY M.P.S

NOW FEAR THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT WAITS UNTIL NEXT YEAR BEFORE CALLING

THE ELECTION, IT MAY LOSE ITS GAINS IN ANOTHER WINTER SLUMP AND HAVE

EVEN LESS TIME FOR RECOVERY BEFORE ITS FIVEYEAR MANDATE EXPIRES IN

OCTOBER 1964 . IN ANY CASE, THE CAMPAIGN IS ALREADY UNDER WAY . PRIME

MINISTER HAROLD MACMILLAN THREW A STRAW IN THE WIND BY REAPPOINTING

HARDHEADED LORD POOLE AS COCHAIRMAN OF THE PARTY WITH LEADER OF THE

HOUSE IAIN MACLEOD . POOLE, WHO RAISED RECORD SUMS FOR THE TORIES IN

THE 1955 AND 1959 CAMPAIGNS, IS THE REPUTED AUTHOR OF THE "

NEVER-HAD-IT-SO-GOOD " THEME THAT HELPED RETURN THE GOVERNMENT AT THE

LAST ELECTION . GREY UTOPIA . LAST WEEKEND, WITH POOLE AND 32 OTHER TOP

TORIES WHO WERE SUMMONED TO THE PRIME MINISTER'S COUNTRY HOME,

MACMILLAN STARTED DRAFTING THE PARTY'S BROAD, LONG-TERM PROGRAM OF

SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC REFORM . ITS THEME, SAID MACMILLAN, WILL BE "

MODERNIZE NOT NATIONALIZE . " IN HIS FIERCEST ATTACK ON LABOR IN MANY

MONTHS, THE PRIME MINISTER CHARGED IN A SPEECH TO GLASGOW TORIES THAT "

THE SOCIALISTS HAVE NOTHING TO OFFER EXCEPT OLD THREATS SUPPORTED BY

SLY PROMISES . " THE OPPOSITION, DECLARED MACMILLAN, STILL CLINGS TO

ITS " OLD-HAT " VIEW OF A SOCIALIST UTOPIA, IN WHICH " EVERYBODY IS

MORE OR LESS THE SAME SHADE OF GREY . " HE INSISTED THAT UNDER LABOR,

BRITAIN WOULD REVERT SWIFTLY TO THE STATUS OF A " SECONDCLASS POWER . "

MACMILLAN'S FINAL DECISION ON THE ELECTION DATE WILL BE INFLUENCED BY

THE GALLUP POLL PERCENTAGES, WHICH IN APRIL SHOWED A FRACTIONAL SLIP IN

LABOR'S MASSIVE LEAD, NOW 49.5 PER CENT TO 34 PER CENT , OVER THE

TORIES . OTHER OMENS WILL BE THE RESULTS OF THREE SPRING BY-ELECTIONS

NECESSITATED BY THE DEATHS OF HUGH GAITSKELL AND TWO OTHER LABOR M.P.S

. ONE THING WAS CERTAIN : AT 69, HAROLD MACMILLAN IS STILL CONFIDENT

THAT THE PARTY CANNOT YET DISPENSE WITH HIS LEADERSHIP . BY WAY OF

PATCHING PARTY MORALE, HE HAS ALREADY QUASHED BACK-BENCH RUMORS THAT HE

MIGHT STEP DOWN . " I'LL BE LEADING YOU INTO THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION,

/ HE TOLD TORY M.P.S RECENTLY, " AND I'LL BE WITH YOU IN THE NEW

PARLIAMENT . /

WEST GERMANY SWEET SUCCESS JOVIAL AND POPULAR ECONOMICS MINISTER

LUDWIG ERHARD, AFTER YEARS OF PATIENTLY AND IMPATIENTLY WAITING, LAST

WEEK FINALLY GOT HIS PARTY'S PROMISE TO MAKE HIM WEST GERMANY'S NEXT

CHANCELLOR . EVEN KONRAD ADENAUER HAD TO SAY YES . VICE CHANCELLOR

SINCE 1957, " UNCLE LUDWIG " WAS THE ARCHITECT OF THE NATION'S POSTWAR

PROSPERITY AND BY FAR THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION'S BEST VOTE-GETTER

. BUT CHANCELLOR ADENAUER, WHO HATES TO GIVE WAY AFTER 14 YEARS IN

POWER, AND HATES EVEN MORE TO GIVE WAY TO ERHARD, THOUGHT HE COULD

STALL OFF ERHARD'S FORMAL APPOINTMENT . AT A PARTY MEETING LAST WEEK,

ADENAUER TRIED TO TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING BUT HIS SUCCESSOR . GRUMPILY,

ADENAUER DECLARED THAT HE COULD NOT TOLERATE A CHANCELLOR-DESIGNATE "

LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER " IN THE REMAINING MONTHS BEFORE HIS PROMISED

FALL RETIREMENT IS A FACT . BESIDES, HE ADDED, " I SIMPLY DON'T SEE WHY

WE MUST REACH A DECISION NOW, " SINCE THERE WERE THREE OTHER CANDIDATES

FOR THE JOB, AND HE NAMED THEM : C.D.U . BUNDESTAG LEADER HEINRICH VON

BRENTANO ; ADENAUER'S OLD CRONY, MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO HEINRICH

KRONE ; FOREIGN MINISTER GERHARD SCHRODER . THE GAMBIT DID NOT WORK

: ONE AFTER THE OTHER, TO THE OLD MAN'S SURPRISE, EACH OF THE THREE

PROMINENT LEADERS ROSE TO REFUSE CANDIDACY FOR THE NATION'S MOST

POWERFUL OFFICE . DER ALTE WAS LICKED, AND TO REPORTERS OUTSIDE, WHO

COMPLAINED ABOUT BEING KEPT AWAY FROM THE MEETING ROOM, HE SNAPPED : "

HOW DO YOU THINK I FELT INSIDE THAT ROOM ? I WOULD RATHER HAVE BEEN

OUTSIDE . " NEXT DAY, WHEN THE C.D.U . PARLIAMENTARY CAUCUS MET TO

FORMALLY RATIFY THE CHOICE OF ERHARD AS SUCCESSOR, THE 87-YEAR-OLD

ADENAUER WAS STILL BURNING . " I BEAR NO PERSONAL ANIMOSITY TOWARD

PROFESSOR ERHARD, " HE SAID, " BUT MY OPINION IS THAT HE IS NOT A

SUITABLE MAN TO BE CHANCELLOR . " THE CAUCUS OVERWHELMINGLY DISAGREED,

VOTED 159 TO 47 (WITH 19 ABSTENTIONS) TO NAME ERHARD, 66, THE C.D.U.'S

NEXT CHANCELLOR . FOR LUDWIG ERHARD, WHO SAT CHEWING ON A CIGAR

THROUGHOUT THE PROCEEDINGS, SUCCESS WAS TOO SWEET FOR ANY THOUGHT OF

REVENGE AGAINST HIS OLD FOE . HE PLEDGED " TO FORGIVE AND FORGET "

ADENAUER'S INSULTS . ALL EYES THEN SWUNG TO DER ALTE, WHO SWALLOWED HIS

BITTERNESS, PROMISED TO ABIDE BY THE MAJORITY DECISION . " I AM

WILLING, " HE TOLD ERHARD, " TO PASS ALONG TO YOU ALL I KNOW THE

INTERESTS OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE . " THEN HE ABRUPTLY STOOD UP, SLOWLY

AND IMPASSIVELY WALKED THROUGH THE CROWD TO HIS WAITING CAR, AND WITH A

WEARY WAVE OF FAREWELL, DROVE HOME .

SOUTHEAST ASIA A LOSING PROPOSITION THE WEST'S MANEUVERS TO

COUNTER THE DISINTEGRATION IN LAOS LAST WEEK WERE LARGELY DIPLOMATIC .

IN LONDON, BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY LORD HOME CALLED ON RUSSIA

CO-ADMINISTRATOR WITH BRITAIN OF THE GENEVA ACCORDS TO SIGN A JOINT

APPEAL THAT THE FEUDING FORCES IN LAOS END THEIR FIGHTING . FEARFUL

THAT SUCH PEACE TALK WOULD NUDGE ASIAN COMMUNIST REVOLUTIONARIES STILL

CLOSER TO RIVAL RED CHINA AND ITS " HARD LINE, " RUSSIA REFUSED, UNLESS

THE STATEMENT SPECIFICALLY BLAMED THE U.S . FOR UNDERMINING THE PEACE

IN LAOS . BRITAIN VETOED THE SUGGESTION . PRESIDENT KENNEDY HUSTLED

UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS AVERELL HARRIMAN, WHO

HAD HAMMERED OUT THE BASIC FORMAT FOR THE GENEVA AGREEMENT LAST SUMMER,

TO MOSCOW TO URGE ON KHRUSHCHEV THE NEED FOR RUSSIAN INTERCESSION IN

LAOS . " WE REGARD THE MAINTENANCE OF THE GENEVA ACCORDS AS ESSENTIAL

TO THE SECURITY OF LAOS ITSELF, " SAID KENNEDY, " AND AS A TEST OF

WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE FOR AN ACCORD TO BE REACHED BETWEEN COUNTRIES

WHICH HAVE SERIOUS DIFFERENCES . " IN MOSCOW, HARRIMAN WAS RECEIVED

COOLLY ; ONLY A JUNIOR PROTOCOL OFFICER WAS AT THE AIRPORT TO MEET HIM

. WHEN HE GOT TO THE KREMLIN, HE FOUND KHRUSHCHEV MORE THAN HAPPY TO

GIVE VAGUE ENDORSEMENT OF THE GENEVA ACCORDS, BUT LESS THAN WILLING TO

TAKE ANY CONCRETE ACTION TO STOP THE FIGHTING IN THE PLAIN OF JARS.

THE ROAD BUILDERS . AS THE DIPLOMATS TALKED, THE PENTAGON WAS QUIETLY

FLEXING ITS MUSCLES . UNITS OF THE U.S . SEVENTH FLEET BEGAN CRUISING

IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA, AND THOUGH THE MOVE HAD BEEN PLANNED FOR

MONTHS, WASHINGTON PICKED LAST WEEK TO ANNOUNCE THAT TWO COMBAT-READY

BATTLE GROUPS WOULD SOON MOVE INTO THAILAND TO TAKE PART IN NEXT

MONTH'S FULL-SCALE SEATO BATTLE MANEUVERS . IT WAS REMINISCENT OF THE

CRASH BUILDUP OF TROOP STRENGTH IN THAILAND JUST A YEAR AGO, WHEN THE

LAST SERIOUS FLARE-UP IN LAOS TOOK PLACE . LEFT BEHIND WHEN THESE

TROOPS WERE WITHDRAWN WERE ENOUGH TRUCKS, TANKS AND PERSONNEL CARRIERS

TO EQUIP A THIRD BATTLE GROUP THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED IN THE EVENT OF

EMERGENCY . THE

PLAIN IS NAMED FOR THE SCORES OF LARGE, STONE BURIAL URNS DOTTING THE

AREA, IN WHICH THE ANCESTRAL ASHES OF THE LAOTIAN PEOPLE WERE ONCE

DEPOSITED . BOTH THE PATHET LAO AND THE NEUTRALISTS AVOID FIGHTING NEAR

THE JARS, FOR LAOTIAN TRADITION HOLDS THAT THE PENALTY FOR DISTURBING

THEM IS A VIOLENT AND FIERY RETRIBUTION FROM THE SPIRITS WITHIN .

APART FROM THE COMBAT TROOPS, SOME 2,600

OTHER U.S . MILITARY PERSONNEL CHIEFLY ENGINEERS AND SIGNAL TROOPS ARE

IN THAILAND . NEAR THE LAOTIAN BORDER, A U.S . ARMY CONSTRUCTION

BATTALION IS NEARING COMPLETION OF AN ALLWEATHER JET AIRSTRIP . AT A

MEETING WITH TOP U.S . AIDES IN BANGKOK, ADMIRAL HARRY D . FELT,

COMMANDER OF ALL U.S . FORCES IN THE PACIFIC, DISCUSSED CONTINGENCY

PLANS IN THE EVENT THAT THE PATHET LAO MOVES OFF THE PLAIN OF JARS INTO

THE MEKONG RIVER VALLEY . THE U.S . IS NOT COMMITTED TO PUT TROOPS

INTO LAOS,

AND THE MILITARY IS NOT ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF FIGHTING

THERE, FOR THE LACK OF AIRFIELDS, RAILROADS AND GOOD ROADS WOULD MAKE

IT TOUGH TO SUSTAIN OPERATIONS . BUT IF THE PATHET LAO SHOWED AN

INCLINATION TO SWEEP ALL THE WAY SOUTH, THE U.S . FORCES IN THAILAND

MIGHT WELL HAVE TO MOVE ACROSS THE MEKONG AND OCCUPY THE LAOTIAN

CAPITAL OF VIENTIANE AND OTHER STRATEGIC POINTS IN THE VALLEY .

MEANWHILE IN LAOS ITSELF, A LULL HAD SETTLED OVER THE BATTLEFIELD . IN

A FLYING VISIT TO THE PLAIN OF JARS, NEUTRALIST PREMIER SOUVANNA PHOUMA

MANAGED TO ARRANGE A SHAKY CEASE-FIRE BETWEEN THE PATHET LAO AND KONG

LE'S NEUTRALISTS . THOUGH SPORADIC ARTILLERY DUELS STILL POCKMARKED THE

PLAIN, THERE WERE NO OUTRIGHT RED ATTACKS, AND THE NEUTRALISTS LOST NO

NEW TERRITORY . BUT HOSTILITIES THREATENED TO ERUPT FROM ANOTHER

QUARTER . AROUND THE PERIMETER OF THE PLAIN, RIGHT-WING GENERAL PHOUMI

NOSAVAN WAS REINFORCING HIS POSITIONS, AND IN THE FOOTHILLS BEHIND THE

PATHET LAO LINES, TOUGH, WELL-ARMED MEO TRIBESMEN, WHO HAVE NO LOVE FOR

THE REDS, POSED A DANGEROUS THREAT TO COMMUNIST SUPPLY ROUTES FROM

NORTH VIET NAM . IF LAOS SHOULD FALL TO THE REDS, NORTH VIET NAM'S HO

CHI MINH TRAIL (SEE MAP), THE SUPPLY ROUTE WHICH

CUTS THROUGH THE LAOTIAN THICKETS TO COMMUNIST VIET CONG GUERRILLAS IN

SOUTH VIET NAM, WOULD OPEN UP, PERMITTING THE REDS TO POUR ARMS AND MEN

INTO THAT EMBATTLED LAND . CONTROL OF LAOS' MEKONG RIVER VALLEY WOULD

ALSO GIVE THE COMMUNISTS A HIGHWAY FOR SUBVERSION OF NEIGHBORING

CAMBODIA AND THAILAND, WHICH IN TURN WOULD INCREASE RED PRESSURE ON

BURMA AND MALAYA . FAIT ACCOMPLI . FOR THE MOMENT, THE REDS APPEARED

CONTENT TO CONSOLIDATE THEIR NEW TERRITORIAL GAINS ON THE PLAIN OF JARS

AND TO LET THE CRISIS COOL OF ITS OWN ACCORD . IF THEY MOVED OFF THE

PLAIN, THEY WOULD SURELY MARCH RIGHT INTO A CIVIL WAR WITH PHOUMI'S

RIGHTIST FORCES, THUS INVITING U.S . INTERVENTION, WHICH THEY WISHED TO

AVOID AT ALL COSTS . DESPITE PROTESTS BY BOTH SOUVANNA AND THE U.S.,

THE PATHET LAO'S TERRITORIAL GRAB WAS A FAIT ACCOMPLI . THERE WERE

THOSE IN THE U.S . WHO THOUGHT THE ONLY LONG-RANGE ANSWER TO THE LAOS

PROBLEM WAS OUTRIGHT PARTITION . ALREADY A DE FACTO PARTITION OF LAOS

EXISTED : THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY WAS FIRMLY CONTROLLED BY

THE COMMUNISTS, AND THE RICE-RICH MEKONG RIVER VALLEY WAS IN THE HANDS

OF THE RIGHTISTS . IT WAS NOT THE IDEAL SOLUTION FOR LAOS . BUT, AS ONE

U.S . OFFICIAL SAID " THERE ARE NO GOOD SOLUTIONS IN LAOS . THERE

HIS RAMBLING REMARKS IN THE KREMLIN'S PALACE OF THE CONGRESSES HAD

MAN IN THE PARTY, WHOM NIKITA HAD QUIETLY SINGLED OUT AS HIS CHOICE

ALMOST FOUR YEARS AGO (TIME COVER, JULY 13, 1959) . BUT OTHER EXPERTS

FROM A MAJOR MOSCOW BLOWOUT LAST WEEK MARKING THE 93RD ANNIVERSARY OF

LENIN'S BIRTH, THUS CONCLUDED THAT KOZLOV MIGHT BE ON THE SKIDS . ON

THE BASIS OF SUCH BARELY VISIBLE CLUES, WEARY KREMLINOLOGISTS STAKE

CAN ARGUE EITHER WAY ; EITHER KHRUSHCHEV IS IN TROUBLE, OR HE'S SO

SECURE IN POWER THAT HE CAN PERFECTLY WELL AFFORD TO MENTION RETIRING .

HAND, WOLFGANG LEONHARD, THE EX-COMMUNIST WHO NOW ANALYZES RED AFFAIRS

MIDDLE EAST SHEIK JACKPOT FIVE TIMES A DAY FOR THE PAST 30

YEARS, THIN, THREADBARE SHEIK SHAKHBUT BIN SULTAN FACED WEST, BOWED

LOW, AND PRAYED FOR AN OIL STRIKE . HIS REALM OF ABU DHABI WAS

DESPERATELY IN NEED OF SOME GOOD LUCK . UP AND DOWN THE PERSIAN GULF,

THE STATES OF QATAR, SAUDI ARABIA, KUWAIT AND IRAN WERE ROLLING IN OIL

WEALTH . BUT YEAR AFTER YEAR, ABU DHABI'S 25,000 SQ . MI . OF SAND,

DATE PALMS AND BARREN OFFSHORE ISLANDS JUST GOT HOTTER, MORE HUMID AND

WINDSWEPT THAN BEFORE . PERPETUAL TRUCE . BUT THEN ALLAH RESPONDED TO

THE SHEIK'S PRAYERS BELATEDLY, BUT IN OVERWHELMING MEASURE . TWO VAST

OILFIELDS HAVE BEEN TAPPED BY BRITISH DRILLING TEAMS, ONE AT MURBAN IN

THE SANDY INTERIOR, THE OTHER IN THE SHALLOW COASTAL WATERS OF THE GULF

. CONSERVATIVE OILMEN ESTIMATE ABU DHABI'S PROVEN OIL RESERVES AT ABOUT

3.8 BILLION BBL., WHICH AT PRESENT ROYALTY RATES WOULD RETURN SOME $1.4

BILLION OVER THE YEARS . RIDICULOUS, SAY OTHER EXPERTS : ON THE BASIS

OF LATEST DISCOVERIES, RESERVES MAY BE AS GREAT AS 38 BILLION BBL .

THIS HAS ALL BEEN RATHER UNSETTLING TO ABU DHABI, WHOSE 15,000 BEDOUINS

HAVE GOT ALONG FOR CENTURIES ON PIRACY, PEARL FISHING AND INTERTRIBAL

RAIDS . IN THE 19TH CENTURY, THE SWIFT PIRATE DHOWS WERE SWEPT FROM THE

GULF BY BRITAIN, WHICH ESTABLISHED " A PERPETUAL MARITIME TRUCE " HENCE

THE NAME TRUCIAL STATES, GIVEN TO ABU DHABI AND SIX OTHER SHEIKDOMS .

PEARL FISHING BECAME UNPROFITABLE WHEN THE JAPANESE CLEVERLY INTRODUCED

CULTURED PEARLS TO THE WORLD . THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT TO ABU DHABI BUT

INTRIGUE : OF THE TWELVE PREDECESSORS OF THE PRESENT SHEIK, ONLY THREE

DIED PEACEFULLY IN THEIR PALACE BEDS . THE REST WERE EITHER MURDERED OR

VIOLENTLY DEPOSED, USUALLY BY CLOSE RELATIVES . SHEIK SHAKHBUT TOOK

OVER IN 1928 WHEN HIS UNCLE WAS ASSASSINATED, AFTER HAVING EARLIER

KILLED SHAKHBUT'S FATHER WHO, IN TURN, HAD COME TO POWER BY KILLING HIS

OLDER BROTHER . SHAKHBUT IS SAID TO HAVE RULED SO LONG AND SAFELY ONLY

BECAUSE HIS OWN TWO BROTHERS SWORE A SOLEMN OATH ON THE KORAN NOT TO

MURDER HIM . BUGS IN THE TREASURY . IN HIS LONG YEARS OF OIL-LESS RULE,

SHEIK SHAKHBUT RAN HIS COUNTRY ON CUSTOMS DUTIES OF $140,000 A YEAR,

FOUGHT SOME DESULTORY WARS WITH HIS NEIGHBORS IN SHARJA AND DUBAI, AND

LIVED QUIETLY IN HIS MUD-WALLED PALACE ON AN OFFSHORE ISLAND . HE

INSTALLED AN AIR CONDITIONER IN HIS BEDROOM BUT SELDOM USED IT BECAUSE

HE DISLIKED THE NOISE . HE ALSO PUT IN A FLUSH TOILET AND A PUMP TO

SUPPLY IT WITH WATER ; SEWAGE DISPOSAL WAS SIMPLY A PIPE JUTTING OUT

FROM THE PALACE WALL . NEARLY EVERY DAY, THE SHEIK SAT CROSSLEGGED IN

HIS THRONE ROOM HOLDING A MAJLIS, AT WHICH HE LISTENED TO COMPLAINTS OF

CITIZENS, WHILE BEDOUIN CHIEFS GROUPED AROUND HIM, SOME HOLDING ON

THEIR WRISTS THE HOODED FALCONS THAT WERE ABU DHABI'S ONLY STATUS

SYMBOL . WHEN THE OIL REVENUES BEGAN TO FLOW IN LAST YEAR, EVERYONE

EXPECTED GREAT THINGS OF SHEIK SHAKHBUT . BUT IT SOON DEVELOPED THAT

WHAT SHAKHBUT LIKED TO DO WITH MONEY WAS COUNT IT, NOT SPEND IT . HE

REFUSED TO ACCEPT CHECKS FROM THE OIL COMPANIES, AT FIRST KEPT HIS CASH

UNDER HIS BED . WHEN THE BEDSPRINGS BEGAN TO BULGE, HE HAD THE CASH

CARTED TO A PALACE DUNGEON . IT WAS ONLY AFTER RATS BEGAN NIBBLING AT

THE TREASURE CHESTS AND INSECTS STARTED EATING THE FOLDING MONEY THAT

SHAKHBUT RELUCTANTLY AGREED TO ACCEPT THE PRINCIPLE OF BANKING . HE NOW

FLOURISHES AN OUTSIZE CHECKBOOK, EMBLAZONED WITH THE RED AND WHITE FLAG

OF ABU DHABI, BUT HE STILL HATES TO SIGN CHECKS . PUTTING OFF PAYDAY .

BRITAIN, WHICH HAS A MOTHER-HEN RELATIONSHIP TO THE ALLEGEDLY

INDEPENDENT TRUCIAL STATES, LAST YEAR PROMOTED AN ABU DHABI DEVELOPMENT

PROGRAM CALLING FOR $70 MILLION WORTH OF ROADS, SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC

WORKS . SHEIK SHAKHBUT, 58, ACCEPTED THE PLAN ONLY IN

THEORY.BUSINESSMEN DEALING WITH THE SHEIK HAVE A TENDENCY TO OVERNIGHT

GREY HAIR . " HE SIMPLY ASKS FOR 50 PER CENT IN EVERY BUSINESS DEAL !

/ SPUTTERED A LEVANTINE ENTREPRENEUR . SHAKHBUT MAY AMIABLY CONCEDE

THAT HE HAS SIGNED A CONTRACT FOR WORK TO BE DONE, THEN ADDS CAGILY, "

BUT I DIDN'T SAY I WOULD PAY FOR IT . " HIS PENNY PINCHING EVEN EXTENDS

TO ABU DHABI'S 470-MAN ARMY : EACH SOLDIER IS PAID PERSONALLY BY

SHAKHBUT, WHO STALLS OFF PAYDAY AS LONG AS POSSIBLE . THE SHEIK'S MIND

RESEMBLES A REVOLVING DOOR . SINCE ABU DHABI HAS VIRTUALLY NO WATER (A

GLASS OF WATER COSTS ABOUT THE SAME AS A GLASS OF GIN), THERE IS A

DESPERATE NEED FOR MODERN EQUIPMENT TO DISTILL SEA WATER . BUT THE

SHEIK HAS THREE TIMES SHIFTED THE LOCATION OF A PROPOSED NEW

DISTILLATION PLANT AND MAY WELL SHIFT IT THREE OR 30 TIMES MORE .

GROANED A FRUSTRATED BRITISH ENGINEER : " WE FREQUENTLY DO SIX WEEKS'

WORK FOR NOTHING . " THE BRITISH PRODUCED PLANS TO MAKE ABU DHABI CITY

INTO A GLITTERING MODERN CAPITAL THAT WOULD BE THE PRIDE OF THE PERSIAN

GULF, BUT AS FAST AS ENGINEERS LAY OUT A NEW BOULEVARD, SHAKHBUT GRANTS

PERMISSION TO A LOCAL MERCHANT TO BUILD A STORE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT .

FISHY FRESHNESS . IN AN EFFORT TO BROADEN THE SHEIK'S OUTLOOK, OILMEN

AND THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAVE GIVEN HIM REDCARPET TRIPS TO PARIS,

LONDON AND NEW YORK . WHAT INTERESTED HIM MOST WAS THE LARGE NUMBER OF

AUTOMOBILES IN THE THREE CITIES . " KEEP THE CARS GOING, " HE SAID

EARNESTLY, THINKING HAPPILY OF THE FUTURE CONSUMPTION OF ABU DHABI

GASOLINE . NEW YORK CITY STRUCK HIM AS A " TOWN WHERE PEOPLE ARE NOT

CIVILIZED . THEY LIVE LIKE ANTS OR SWALLOWS IN CLIFFS . THE SUN NEVER

GETS DOWN INTO THE STREETS . " HE WAS APPALLED BY TV WESTERNS : " ALL

THAT SHOOTING UPSETS THE BASIS OF GOOD GOVERNMENT ! " WHAT DELIGHTS

SHAKHBUT IS THE TRADITIONAL LIFE OF HIS PEOPLE . " THE THING THAT

PLEASES ME MOST, " HE SAYS, " IS HUNTING FOR BUSTARDS WITH OUR FALCONS

. IT'S TREMENDOUS TO SEE THE FALCON FIGHTING THE BUSTARD AND KILLING IT

. EACH FALCON HAS ITS OWN SPECIAL OWNER AND REFUSES TO HUNT FOR ANYONE

ELSE . " THE SHEIK IS ALSO A CONNOISSEUR OF CAMEL'S MILK HIS ONLY DRINK

AND CAN TELL BY THE MILK'S TASTE WHAT THE CAMEL HAS BEEN EATING AND

WHERE IT WAS IN THE DESERT FOR THE BEST MILK, HE EXPLAINS, WE FEED

CAMELS

ON SEA MANGROVE AND DRIED FISH . THIS GIVES THE MILK A SLIGHTLY FISHY

FRESHNESS WE APPRECIATE . " SHAKHBUT ONCE OWNED A CADILLAC, BUT WHEN IT

FINALLY BROKE DOWN HE JUST ABANDONED IT . NOW HE MAKES HIS STATE VISITS

IN A BONE-JARRING LAND-ROVER, BUT WITHOUT ENTHUSIASM . " I DID ALL MY

TRAVELING BY CAMEL IN THE OLD DAYS, " HE SIGHS, " BUT NOW I HAVE TO GO

BY CAR BECAUSE IF THE RULER WENT BY CAMEL, PEOPLE WOULD THINK IT

PECULIAR . /

ITALY BETWEEN LEFT & RIGHT FIFTEEN MONTHS AGO, WHEN ITALIAN

PREMIER AMINTORE FANFANI MARCHED HIS MODERATE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC

PARTY THROUGH THE APERTURA A SINISTRA (OPENING TO THE LEFT) INTO A

PARLIAMENTARY PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEFT-WING SOCIALISTS, HE

ACKNOWLEDGED THE DEAL AS A DANGEROUS GAMBLE . " WE SHALL CERTAINLY HAVE

SOME SLEEPLESS NIGHTS, " HE SAID . BY NOW, FANFANI MUST BE A HOPELESS

INSOMNIAC . LAST WEEK NEARLY 33 MILLION ITALIANS WENT TO THE POLLS FOR

NATIONAL ELECTIONS AND REWARDED THEIR EXPERIMENTING PREMIER WITH A

JOLTING SETBACK THAT COST HIS PARTY 730,000 VOTES AND MAY WELL COST HIM

HIS JOB . THE APERTURA MIGHT SURVIVE, BUT ITS FUTURE LIKE FANFANI'S

WOULD BE RISKIER THAN EVER . ASHEN-FACED, THE PINTSIZE (5 FT . 1 IN.)

PREMIER FACED REPORTERS IN THE CHIGI PALACE ON ELECTION NIGHT WITH

UNCOMMON SHOCK . " THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS, " HE DECLARED, " HAVE BEEN

DECLARED AS THE RELATIVE MAJORITY PARTY, EVEN IF BY A NARROWER MARGIN

THAN BEFORE . AND NOW TO BED . " PAPAL PAL . TO BED INDEED . FANFANI

ALREADY HAD NEWS OF THE MASSIVE GAINS OF PALMIRO TOGLIATTI'S

COMMUNISTS, WHO IMPROVED THEIR POSITION AS THE COUNTRY'S SECOND LARGEST

PARTY (AFTER THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS), WON 25 PER CENT OF THE ENTIRE

NATION'S VOTES, AND 26 NEW SEATS IN THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES . THE REDS

NOW HOLD A TOTAL OF 166 OF THE CHAMBER'S 630 PLACES, COMPARED WITH THE

CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS' 260 . UNDER THE SHREWD LEADERSHIP OF AGING (70)

COMMUNIST BOSS PALMIRO TOGLIATTI, THE REDS HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN CARE TO

BALANCE THEIR IDEOLOGY AGAINST THE FACT THAT ITALY IS A CATHOLIC NATION

. AT ONE TIME THEY BACKED THE MONARCHY ; NOWADAYS THEY EVEN FAVOR THE

CAPITALIST COMMON MARKET . AS A NATION, ITALY IS LESS THAN A CENTURY

OLD ; FIRST UNDER THE MONARCHY, THEN THROUGH THE LONG NIGHT OF

FASCISM, THE COUNTRY HAS HAD LITTLE TIME TO ACCUSTOM ITSELF TO

DEMOCRACY . THUS, TO MANY ITALIANS, COMMUNISM OR AT LEAST THEIR BRAND

OF IT DOES NOT APPEAR THE FEARFUL SPECTER THAT IT DOES IN MANY OTHER

LANDS . IN PART, THE COMMUNIST SHOWING WAS DUE TO RED DEFECTIONS FROM

PIETRO NENNI'S SHARPLY DIVIDED SOCIALISTS, THE LEFTWING CROWD THAT HAD

THROWN ITS LOT WITH FANFANI . AND IN PART IT WAS DUE TO POPE JOHN

XXIII, WHO HAD GIVEN A MODICUM OF APPROVAL TO THE FAR LEFT WITH HIS

PACEM IN TERRIS ENCYCLICAL, AND WITH HIS WARM WELCOME TO THE VATICAN

LAST MARCH FOR NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV'S VISITING SON-IN-LAW, ALEKSEI

ADZHUBEI . NEW LOW . FROM THE RIGHT, APERTURA'S CHIEF CHALLENGE WAS

AMONG THE FREE-ENTERPRISING LIBERALS, WHO MORE THAN DOUBLED THEIR

PREVIOUS VOTE OF 1,000,000 ; THIS WAS A SPECTACULAR GAIN, EVEN IF IT

AMOUNTED TO ONLY 7 PER CENT OF THE TOTAL TURNOUT . MOST OF THE CREDIT

WENT TO TIRELESS LIBERAL CAMPAIGNER GIOVANNI MALAGODI, 58, A BANKER

TURNED POLITICIAN, WHO HIT OUT HARD AT FANFANI'S SCHEMES FOR MORE

GOVERNMENT PLANNING AND HIGHER TAXES . IT WAS FANFANI'S OWN CHRISTIAN

DEMOCRATS WHO TOOK THE WORST DRUBBING OF ALL . THE PARTY HAD NO TROUBLE

REMAINING IN FIRST PLACE WITH 11.7 MILLION BALLOTS, BUT ON A PERCENTAGE

BASIS IT SANK TO THE LOWEST SHARE OF THE TOTAL VOTE (ABOUT 38 PER CENT

) SINCE WORLD WAR II . SUMMED UP ROME'S IL MESSAGGERO : INTERNAL

DISSENSION AND " INCESSANT CLAMOR HAD THE EFFECT OF DRIVING AWAY VOTERS

. THE PARTY LOST THE FRIGHTENED, THE CONFUSED AND THE INDECISIVE . " IL

MESSAGGERO'S ADVICE TO STOP SQUABBLING WENT UNHEEDED . LAST WEEK

RIGHT-WING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS, WHO OPPOSED THE APERTURA IN THE FIRST

PLACE, SEIZED THE ELECTION RESULTS AS A SIGNAL TO DEMAND THAT FANFANI

STEP ASIDE AS PREMIER IN THE NEW GOVERNMENT PROBABLY TO BE FORMED THIS

MONTH .

AMOUNT OF SMALL TALK . SON OF A WORLD WAR I ITALIAN GENERAL, HE HAD

STUDIED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ROME AND PISA'S INSTITUTE OF PHYSICS,

WHERE HE SPECIALIZED IN COSMIC RAY RESEARCH . LATER, HE WAS HIRED BY

EURATOM, EUROPE'S COMMUNAL ATOMS-FOR-PEACE AGENCY, AND WENT OFF TO

YUGOSLAVIA TALKING TO TITO ON HIS WAY HOME AFTER A 16,000-MILE

SWING THROUGH ANKARA, TEHERAN, KARACHI AND NEW DELHI, U.S . SECRETARY

OF STATE DEAN RUSK SQUEEZED IN A SHORT STOP IN BELGRADE . FOR THE

DIPLOMATIC RECORD, RUSK OFFICIALLY WAS REPAYING A 1961 VISIT TO

WASHINGTON BY YUGOSLAV FOREIGN MINISTER KOCA POPOVIC . BUT THERE WAS

MORE TO RUSK'S COURTESY CALL THAN THAT . U.S.-YUGOSLAV RELATIONS WERE

NEVER REALLY WARM ; SINCE THE U.S . CONGRESS LAST SUMMER SERVED NOTICE

THAT IT WOULD ELIMINATE BELGRADE'S " MOST FAVORED NATION " TRADING

CLAUSE THIS YEAR, THEY HAVE BEEN POSITIVELY CHILLY . MARSHAL TITO'S

OSTENTATIOUSLY FRIENDLY TRIP TO MOSCOW LAST YEAR DID NOT IMPROVE

MATTERS, EITHER . BUT BELGRADE WAS ANXIOUS TO ASSURE THE U.S . THAT IT

WAS OFFICIALLY STILL " UNALIGNED, " AND TO SMOOTH THINGS OVER, RUSK

AGREED AT THE LAST MINUTE TO MAKE HIS VISIT . POPOVIC WAS OUT AT MODERN

SUCRIN AIRPORT TO GREET RUSK WHEN THE BIG U.S . JET TOUCHED DOWN . ALSO

ON HAND WAS A RED CARPET AND A MILITARY BAND . BUT THAT WAS THE END OF

THE FANFARE . SINCE THE YUGOSLAVS DO NOT UNFURL FOREIGN FLAGS ALONG THE

NEW AUTOPUT THAT LEADS FROM THE AIRPORT TO THE CITY EXCEPT FOR A

VISITING CHIEF OF STATE, RUSK'S ROUTE WAS LINED WITH BLUEAND-WHITE

FINNISH BANNERS IN PLACE FOR PRESIDENT URHO K . KEKKONEN'S ARRIVAL NEXT

DAY . THERE WERE NO CROWDS AT ALL, SINCE THE YUGOSLAVS DID NOT BOTHER

TO ANNOUNCE RUSK'S TRIP IN ADVANCE . AFTER LUNCH WITH POPOVIC AND A

RECEPTION AT THE U.S . EMBASSY GIVEN BY RETIRING U.S . AMBASSADOR

GEORGE KENNAN, RUSK PAID A CALL ON TITO IN HIS BELGRADE VILLA .

YUGOSLAVIA HAS SOME 1956 VINTAGE U.S . MILITARY EQUIPMENT FOR WHICH

TITO WOULD LIKE SPARE PARTS ; SINCE 50 PER CENT OF YUGOSLAVIA'S

COMMERCE IS WITH THE WEST, IT IS WORRIED ABOUT THE RISING TARIFF WALLS

OF THE SIX-NATION COMMON MARKET . NATURALLY, TITO RAISED THE PROBLEM OF

/ MOST FAVORED " NATION STATUS WHICH, IF ELIMINATED, COULD SHARPLY

BOOST IMPORT LEVIES ON YUGOSLAVIA'S $30 MILLION ANNUAL TRADE WITH THE

U.S . RUSK COULD OFFER NO ASSURANCES THAT THE CLAUSE WOULD BE RESTORED,

SINCE THE DECISION IS UP TO CONGRESS . ON THE WHOLE, IT WAS A PLEASANT

IF INCONCLUSIVE CHAT . THEN, LESS THAN 24 HOURS AFTER HE ARRIVED, THE

SECRETARY OF STATE, HIS WIFE, AND 28 AIDES WHO HAD ACCOMPANIED HIM ON

THE FIVE-NATION TRIP, PACKED UP AND HEADED FOR WASHINGTON .

FRANCE LIBERTE, EGALITE MAIS VERITE ? " EVERY FRENCHMAN, " BY

ANCIENT AXIOM, " IS WILLING TO DIE FOR HIS COUNTRY ; BUT NONE IS

WILLING TO PAY FOR IT . " SO PASSIONATELY DO THE FRENCH PURSUE THEIR

DEMOCRATIC IDEAL OF REPRESENTATION WITHOUT TAXATION THAT CHEATING LE

FISC, AS THEY CALL THE INCOME TAX BUREAU, HAS BECOME THE MOST PERVASIVE

AND ENGROSSING NATIONAL PASSTIME AFTER LOVE-MAKING AND A FAR LESS RISKY

ONE . AS A RESULT OF THE CENTURIES-OLD DUEL BETWEEN CHRONICALLY

STRAPPED GOVERNMENTS AND PERENNIALLY POOR-MOUTHED CITIZENS, FRANCE IN

THEORY IMPOSES HIGHER INCOME TAXES THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER WESTERN

COUNTRY, AND IN PRACTICE COLLECTS LESS : A MERE 14 PER CENT OF

GOVERNMENT REVENUE V . 60 PER CENT IN THE U.S . " EVERYBODY IS A

CONSPIRATOR, " LAMENTED PREMIER (AND ONETIME BANKER) GEORGES POMPIDOU

AS HIS GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED A FACT-FINDING PROGRAM CALLED OPERATION

VERITE (OPERATION TRUTH), WHOSE MAIN AIM IS TO GET FRENCHMEN TO DO WHAT

COMES UNNATURALLY TO REPORT THEIR EARNINGS . WHY, CRIED THE PREMIER, "

IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW EVEN WHAT A GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE EARNS

! " IN 1961, THE GOVERNMENT ESTIMATES, AT LEAST 36 MILLION OF

FRANCE'S 46 MILLION PEOPLE PAID NOT A SINGLE SOU OF INCOME TAX ; BY

THE MOST CONSERVATIVE RECKONING, 50 PER CENT OF THOSE WHO SHOULD PAY

TAXES GOT OFF SCOT-FREE . EVEN MORE REMARKABLE, IN THE MIDST OF

UNPARALLELED UPPER-CRUST OPULENCE, WAS THAT IN ALL FRANCE ONLY 1,014

CITIZENS BARELY ENOUGH TO SUPPORT ONE OF PARIS' #$ #$ #$ RESTAURANTS

ADMITTED TO EARNING MORE THAN $12,800 A YEAR . FISCAL CAMOUFLAGE . THE

INJUSTICE OF THE SYSTEM IS THAT HAPLESS WAGE EARNERS, WHOSE INCOMES ARE

RECORDED ON COMPANY PAYROLLS AND ARE THUS EASILY AVAILABLE TO LE FISC,

SHELL OUT TWO-THIRDS OF ALL THE INCOME TAXES COLLECTED IN FRANCE .

WHILE THE RICH GET RICHER, THANKS TO AN ECONOMIC BOOM AND THE NATIVE

GENIUS FOR FISCAL CAMOUFLAGE, RICH AND POOR ALIKE MOST SHOULDER MASSIVE

CONSUMER TAXES, SUCH AS THE 74 PER CENT LEVY THAT MAKES FRENCH GASOLINE

(90 #$ A GALLON) EUROPE'S MOST EXPENSIVE . TAX REFORM HAS SELDOM SEEMED

MORE IMPERATIVE, FOR THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS URGENTLY TO BE ASSURED OF

EVER-RISING REVENUES FOR SUCH HUGE UNDERTAKINGS AS ITS FORCE DE FRAPPE,

INCLUDING AN EXTRAVAGANT THREE-YEAR BUILDUP FOR FRANCE'S FIRST HBOMB

TESTS IN THE PACIFIC, ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK . AT THE SAME TIME, THE

ECONOMY IS THREATENED BY A BURST OF INFLATION THAT HAS BOOSTED INCOMES

AND PRICES 11 PER CENT IN THE PAST YEAR AND THREATENS TO GET OUT OF

HAND IN THE WAKE OF THE RECENT, SUCCESSFUL MINERS' STRIKE FOR HIGHER

PAY . POODLES & PICASSOS . TO PUT TEETH IN ITS TAX-EXTRACTION CAMPAIGN,

THE GOVERNMENT HAS UNLEASHED A HORDE OF EXPERT SNOOPERS WHO DESCEND

UNEXPECTEDLY ON COMPANIES AND CAN SPOT A PADDED PAYROLL AS UNERRINGLY

AS A MICHELIN INSPECTOR EXPOSING A WARMED-OVER SAUCE BEARNAISE . BUT

EXPERIENCE PROVES THAT IT WILL TAKE FAR MORE RUTHLESS MEASURES TO MAKE

INDIVIDUAL FRENCHMEN DIVULGE THEIR TRUE EARNINGS . IN 1947, WHEN ROBERT

SCHUMAN WAS FINANCE MINISTER, THE GOVERNMENT DID ITS BEST BY

INTRODUCING THE THEORY OF " EXTERNAL SIGNS OF WEALTH, " A WONDROUSLY

COMPLEX LATIN FORMULA WHEREBY TAX INSPECTORS GAUGED A MAN'S RICHESSE BY

COUNTING AND GRADING HIS SERVANTS, CARS, YACHTS, DOGS (PUREBRED OR

MONGREL ? ) AND DECLARABLE MISTRESSES . AS A RESULT, WEALTHY

PARISIANS LET THE PAINT PEEL FROM THEIR HOUSES, PUT THEIR PICASSOS IN

THE ATTIC, AND CLAIMED THAT THEIR PEDIGREED POODLES WERE USED

EXCLUSIVELY AS WATCHDOGS, WHICH ARE TAXEXEMPT . (LE FISC FINALLY

ABANDONED ITS HIT-AND-MISTRESS METHODS THIS YEAR.) WHEN THE INSPECTORS

STARTED DEMANDING TAXPAYERS' FINANCIAL RECORDS, ARTFUL FRENCHMEN FROM

PLUMBERS TO LANDLORDS RETALIATED BY INSISTING ON CASH FOR THEIR

SERVICES ; THE MOST FASHIONABLE DOCTOR IN PARIS TODAY WOULD SOONER

VOTE FOR SOCIALIZED MEDICINE THAN ACCEPT A PATIENT'S CHECK . THE

GOVERNMENT'S BIGGEST PROBLEM IS THAT HONESTY, AS FRENCH TAXPAYERS SEE

IT, IS NOT MERELY IRRELEVANT BUT ALMOST CERTAINLY DISASTROUS AS WELL .

A HIGH-MINDED YOUNG PARISIAN ARTIST ONCE FILED A SCRUPULOUSLY ACCURATE

TAX RETURN AND WAS HORRFIED TO FIND THAT THE SKEPTICAL LOCAL INSPECTOR,

APPLYING THE STANDARD CORRECTION FACTOR, CREDITED HIM WITH THREE TIMES

THE INCOME HE REPORTED . THIS WEEK THE GOVERNMENT PRESENTED AN

AMBITIOUS PROGRAM OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC REFORM TO THE NATIONAL

ASSEMBLY, AND THE PERENNIAL QUESTION OF HOW TO PAY FOR IT ONCE AGAIN

CAME TO THE FORE . OF COURSE, DE GAULLE COULD ALWAYS IMITATE THE

ANGLO-SAXONS AND SEND TAX EVADERS TO JAIL . BUT THEN HOW WOULD HE RAISE

THE REVENUE TO BUILD ALL THOSE NEW PRISONS ?

HE CHATTED WITH ARMY OFFICERS AND INSPECTED TROOPS IN THEIR SANDBAG

DETERMINATION TO STAY IN POWER, HUSSEIN JEERED AT ISRAEL, PARTLY TO

PACIFY THE PALESTINIAN ARABS, WHO MAKE UP TWO-THIRDS OF HIS 1,800,000

SUBJECTS, PARTLY BECAUSE ISRAEL'S SUPPORT FOR JORDAN INDEPENDENCE IS A

POLITICAL EMBARRASSMENT . THE PROBLEM THREATENED TO INVOLVE THE

U.S . WASHINGTON HAD GIVEN HUSSEIN ASSURANCES OF SUPPORT . WITH NEXT

WAS STILL INTACT, AND IT WAS THE ARAB UNITY MOVEMENT THAT WAS REELING .

IT HAD TO DO WITH A CABINET CRISIS IN SYRIA BETWEEN THE MAJORITY

BELONGING TO THE BAATH SOCIALIST PARTY AND THE MINORITY OF STRONGLY

NASSERITE MINISTERS . THE STRUGGLE HAD BEEN BREWING FOR TWO MONTHS, AND

PRO-NASSER MINISTERS FRANKLY TOLD NEWSMEN THAT THEY INTENDED TO

OVERTHROW THE BAATHISTS . THE BAATH COUNTER-STRATEGY, AS ENUNCIATED BY

ITS FOUNDER, MICHEL AFLAK, WAS : " DO EVERYTHING TO PRESERVE UNITY,

BUT DON'T GIVE AN INCH, AND DON'T SURRENDER ANY POWER . " WHEN RUMORS

OF A PRO-NASSER ARMY COUP LAST WEEK SWEPT THE VOLATILE SYRIAN CAPITAL

OF DAMASCUS, BAATH ACTED . MORE THAN 100 ARMY OFFICERS WERE DISMISSED

OR CLAPPED IN JAIL . IN RETALIATION, ALL SIX NASSERITE MINISTERS HANDED

IN THEIR RESIGNATIONS . DEPUTY PREMIER NIHAD ELKASSEM, WHO HAD LED A

SYRIAN UNITY DELEGATION TO CAIRO LAST MARCH AND HAD SOBBED WITH JOY ON

NASSER'S SHOULDER, CRIED, " WE ARE GIVING UP OUR RESPONSIBILITIES

BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN THE MEANS TO CARRY THEM OUT . " THE

EXPEDITIONARY FORCE PULLS OUT AS PROMISED . IN OBTAINING THE

SETTLEMENT, BUNKER MADE THREE TRIPS TO SAUDI ARABIA AND HELD "

EXTENSIVE TALKS " WITH PRESIDENT GAMAL ABDEL NASSER IN CAIRO . GIVING

FORCE TO BUNKER'S ARGUMENTS WAS THE BASIC POLICY DECISION OF THE

KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION TO BACK THE PRO-NASSER YEMENI REPUBLICANS

AGAINST THE FEUDAL ROYALIST TRIBES . THIS DECISION WAS UNDOUBTEDLY

CONVEYED, TACTFULLY, TO SAUDI ARABIA'S PREMIER PRINCE FEISAL BY BUNKER

. UNQUESTIONABLY, NASSER WAS ALSO TOLD THAT THERE IS A LIMIT TO HIS

EXPANSIONIST DRIVE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, AND THAT THE U.S . UNALTERABLY

OPPOSES HIS STIRRING UP TROUBLE IN OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES . UPPERMOST IN

WASHINGTON'S MIND WAS THE DANGER THAT THE FIGHTING MIGHT SPREAD INTO

SAUDI ARABIA, WHERE THE U.S . HAS BIG OIL HOLDINGS . SWITCHED

ALLEGIANCE . THE U.N . OBSERVER TEAM, WHICH WILL BE SET UP BY THE

FORMER U.N . CONGO COMMANDER, SWEDISH MAJOR GENERAL CARL VON HORN, IS A

DEVICE TO SAVE POLITICAL FACE FOR EVERYONE . SAUDI ARABIA HAD ALREADY

BEEN CUTTING BACK ON ITS SUPPLY OF MONEY AND GUNS TO THE ROYALISTS,

LARGELY BECAUSE EGYPT'S PROJECTED PLAN FOR UNITY WITH SYRIA AND IRAQ

MADE NASSER FAR TOO FORMIDABLE AN OPPONENT . THE U.N . INTERVENTION

ALSO GIVES NASSER A WAY OUT OF THE YEMEN MESS, WHICH HAS TIED UP A

THIRD OF HIS ARMY AT A COST OF $1,000,000 A DAY AND NEARLY 5,000

CASUALTIES . ON BALANCE, NASSER EMERGES AS A CLEAR WINNER . THOUGH

PROMISING TO REMOVE HIS TROOPS, HE HAS THE PRIVILEGE OF LEAVING AN

UNSPECIFIED NUMBER FOR THE " TRAINING " OF YEMEN'S REPUBLICAN ARMY .

ABOUT THE ONLY GROUP NOT CONSULTED WAS IMAM MOHAMMED AND HIS ROYALISTS,

WHOSE GRIP ON YEMEN HAS DWINDLED FROM HALF THE COUNTRY TO THE MOUNTAIN

SPINE IN CENTRAL YEMEN . SOME 25,000 ARMED SUPPORTERS OF THE IMAM ARE

STILL IN ACTION AND STILL DANGEROUS, BUT THEY ARE INCREASINGLY

ISOLATED, AND SHORT OF FUEL AND WEAPONS . WITH THE ROYALISTS CUT OFF

FROM SAUDI SUPPLIES, NASSER MAY WELL BE ABLE GRADUALLY TO CONSOLIDATE

HIS GAINS, CUT DOWN ON HIS COMMITMENTS, AND ULTIMATELY COMPLETE HIS

VICTORY BY ADMITTING REPUBLICAN YEMEN INTO HIS GRANDIOSE SCHEME FOR A

NEW UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC .

SOUTH AFRICA DISPENSING WITH JUDGES IN 1960 CHOCOLATE-SKINNED

ROBERT SOBUKWE, 38, HEAD OF THE BLACK NATIONALIST PAN-AFRICAN CONGRESS,

WAS SENTENCED TO THREE YEARS IN JAIL FOR " INCITEMENT TO RIOT . " AS

HIS RELEASE DATE DREW NEAR LAST WEEK, SOBUKWE, A SLIM ONETIME

UNIVERSITY LECTURER, WAS HUSTLED FROM THE MAXIMUM-SECURITY PRISON IN

PRETORIA TO A BLEAK DETENTION CAMP ON ROBBEN ISLAND IN TABLE BAY, SIX

MILES FROM CAPE TOWN . THERE HE LEARNED, JUST THE DAY BEFORE HE WAS TO

RECEIVE FREEDOM, THAT SOUTH AFRICA'S PARLIAMENT HAD RAMMED THROUGH A

NEW SECURITY ACT EMPOWERING JUSTICE MINISTER JOHANNES VORSTER TO KEEP

POLITICAL PRISONERS IN CUSTODY INDEFINITELY, EVEN AFTER THEIR SENTENCES

HAVE EXPIRED . SHRUGGED SOBUKWE : " IF YOU BELIEVE IN FREEDOM, YOU

MUST SUFFER FOR IT . " ENDLESS REPETITION . THE NEW MEASURE, WHICH WAS

DEMANDED BY PRIME MINISTER HENDRIK VERWOERD TO MEET A " CRISIS OF

SURVIVAL, " MAKES LAST YEAR'S SABOTAGE ACT SEEM TAME BY COMPARISON, HAS

ALREADY BEEN DUBBED THE " NO TRIAL " BILL . IT PROMISES THE DEATH

PENALTY FOR CITIZENS WHO RECEIVE TRAINING IN SUBVERSION ABROAD OR URGE

INTERVENTION BY FORCE IN SOUTH AFRICA . POSTAL AUTHORITIES CAN OPEN,

READ AND HOLD SUSPICIOUS MAIL . ANY POLITICAL SUSPECT, WITHOUT TRIAL,

CAN BE PLACED IN 90-DAY DETENTION, WHICH MAY THEN BE ENDLESSLY REPEATED

. COMMENTED JUSTICE MINISTER VORSTER : " THIS IS AS MUCH POWER AS I

NEED FOR EXISTING CIRCUMSTANCES . IF NECESSARY, I WILL TAKE EVEN

STRONGER STEPS . " ONLY ONE MEMBER OF THE ALL-WHITE PARLIAMENT VOTED

AGAINST THE BILL .

AMID GOVERNMENT JEERS, THE LONE PROGRESSIVE PARTY REPRESENTATIVE,

BRUNETTE HELEN SUZMAN, WARNED THAT BLACK NATIONALISM AS WELL AS WHITE

NATIONALISM FEEDS " ON THIS TYPE OF KRAGDADIGHEID (TOUGHNESS) . "

ALTHOUGH PRIME MINISTER HENDRIK VERWOERD AND VORSTER DESCRIBE THE

MENACE FACING SOUTH AFRICA AS " COMMUNISM, " THE BILL IS CLEARLY AIMED

AT TWO AFRICAN NATIONALIST GROUPS CALLING THEMSELVES POQO AND SPEAR OF

THE NATION . POQO (PRONOUNCED PAW-KAW AND MEANING " FOR OURSELVES ALONE

/ IN THE XHOSA TONGUE) PATTERNS ITSELF AFTER THE DREADED MAU MAU, WHICH

TERRORIZED KENYA IN THE 1950S . IT FIRST ROSE TO PROMINENCE LAST

NOVEMBER, WHEN SOME OF ITS MEMBERS RIOTED IN THE WINE-GROWING CAPE

COMMUNITY OF PAARL, HACKING TWO WHITES TO DEATH WITH PANGAS . LATER,

OPPOSING THE TOTAL APARTHEID SCHEME TO MOVE MOST OF SOUTH AFRICA'S 11

MILLION BLACKS INTO NINE TRIBAL RESERVES, POQO BUTCHERED FIVE WHITES IN

THE TRANSKEI . INTO THE SEA . ACCORDING TO BLACK NATIONALIST POTLAKO

LEBALLO, WHO FLED TO THE BRITISH-RULED ENCLAVE OF BASUTOLAND, POQO IS A

TERRORIST OFFSHOOT OF SOBUKWE'S MILITANT PAN-AFRICAN CONGRESS AND IS

DETERMINED TO " MURDER THE WHITES OR CHASE THEM INTO THE SEA . " AS IT

TURNED OUT, LEBALLO'S BIG MOUTH DID POQO MORE HARM THAN GOOD .

EMBARRASSED BRITISH OFFICIALS ORDERED HIS ARREST, AND HE BARELY ESCAPED

INTO BASUTOLAND'S RUGGED MOUNTAINS, LEAVING BEHIND HIM A LIST OF 10,000

BLACK REBELS IN SOUTH AFRICA . THANKS EITHER TO COINCIDENCE OR TO

BASUTOLAND'S CONNIVANCE, SOUTH AFRICAN POLICE ROUNDED UP 2,000 REBELS,

AND POQO WAS ON THE RUN . SPEAR OF THE NATION, WHICH OPERATES WITH MORE

FINESSE THAN POQO AND AT PRESENT TRIES TO SPARE HUMAN LIFE, IS THE

MILITANT ARM OF THE AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS, WHOSE NOBEL PRIZEWINNING

LEADER, EX-CHIEF ALBERT LUTHULI, IS UNDER HOUSE ARREST IN RURAL NATAL .

SPEAR'S MOST SPECTACULAR COUPS TO DATE HAVE BEEN THE BOMBING OF THE

AGRICULTURAL MINISTER'S OFFICE IN PRETORIA AND THE BLOWING UP OF

SEVERAL GIANT POWER PYLONS AROUND JOHANNESBURG . SABOTAGE TRIALS

CONTINUE UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY . IN THE EAST RAND TOWN OF BENONI, A

BLACK PRISONER DISRUPTED THE COURT BY SHOUTING " SHOOT ME NOW ! SHOOT

ME NOW ! " THE " NO TRIAL " BILL HAS A PROVISION AIMED DIRECTLY AT

SPEAR'S SABOTEURS : IT PROVIDES UP TO 15 YEARS' IMPRISONMENT MERELY

FOR UNAUTHORIZED PRESENCE IN KEY FACTORIES OR ANY OTHER INSTALLATIONS

WHICH THE GOVERNMENT MAY CHOOSE TO DESIGNATE AS " NO-ENTRY AREAS . "

EUROPE DEADLOCK OR DEATHBLOW ? AS 1963 DAWNED, IT

PROMISED TO BE THE WEST'S YEAR OF DESTINY . ITS GREAT HOPE WAS THE

COMMON MARKET, WHOSE HISTORIC MARCH TOWARD THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL

INTEGRATION OF WESTERN EUROPE SEEMED AS IRRESISTIBLE AS IT WAS

IRREPROACHABLE . IT APPEARED ALMOST INEVITABLE THAT BRITAIN WOULD BE

ADMITTED TO THE COMMON MARKET AND BE FOLLOWED RAPIDLY BY ITS OUTER

SEVEN TRADING PARTNERS, FORMING A NEW CONTINENTAL COMMUNITY AS RICH AND

POPULOUS AS THE U.S . THEN, ARMED WITH BROAD TARIFF-CUTTING POWERS

UNDER PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S TRADE EXPANSION ACT, THE U.S . WAS PREPARED

TO NEGOTIATE WITH EUROPE THE BIGGEST, BOLDEST LIBERALIZATION OF TRADE

IN WESTERN HISTORY . FROM ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP, MANY STATESMEN

BELIEVED, WOULD COME THE POLITICAL FRAMEWORK OF AN ATLANTIC COMMUNITY .

TIRED OF CONCESSIONS . HOW FAR THIS GRAND DESIGN HAS RECEDED FROM

REALITY IS ONLY NOW BECOMING FULLY APPARENT . THE DISINTEGRATION

STARTED LAST JANUARY, WHEN, AS ALL THE WORLD KNOWS, CHARLES DE GAULLE

VETOED BRITAIN'S ADMISSION TO THE COMMON MARKET . BUT WHILE OTHER

MEMBERS OF THE SIX WERE VARYINGLY IRRITATED BY DE GAULLE'S WAY OF

SAYING NON AND DISAPPOINTED BY BRITAIN'S EXCLUSION, FEW AT THE TIME

COULD HAVE PREDICTED THE DEPTH AND DURATION OF DISTRUST THAT DE GAULLE

HAS STIRRED IN EUROPE . AMONG THE SIX, WHO HAVE BEEN DEADLOCKED ON ALL

MAJOR ISSUES EVER SINCE, THERE IS INCREASINGLY WIDESPREAD APPREHENSION

THAT FRANCE'S ADAMANTLY SELF-CENTERED POLICIES MAY HAVE DEALT THE

DEATHBLOW TO THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY THAT WAS ENVISAGED BY ITS FOUNDERS

. IN BRUSSELS LAST WEEK, AT AN ANGRY MEETING OF COMMON MARKET FOREIGN

MINISTERS, WEST GERMANY'S FOREIGN MINISTER GERHARD SCHRODER DECLARED

FLATLY THAT HIS GOVERNMENT IS TIRED OF MAKING ECONOMIC CONCESSIONS TO

SUIT THE FRENCH, WHILE GERMANY'S DOMINANT INTERESTS ARE IMPERILED BY DE

GAULLE'S FOREIGN POLICY GERMANY, WHICH RELIES HEAVILY ON FOREIGN TRADE,

IS DEEPLY CONCERNED BY THE COMMON MARKET'S ISOLATION FROM THE REST OF

EUROPE, AND FOR STRATEGIC REASONS IS INCREASINGLY UNEASY AT FRANCE'S

ALIENATION OF THE U.S . THE SIX, URGED SCHRODER, MUST " TAKE A POSITIVE

ATTITUDE " TO THE " KENNEDY ROUND " OF TARIFF NEGOTIATIONS, " EVEN IF

IT MEANS A SLOWDOWN IN OUR INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT . " FRANCE'S FOREIGN

MINISTER MAURICE COUVE DE MURVILLE, WHOSE GOVERNMENT IS AFRAID OF U.S .

COMPETITION IN EUROPE, REPEATEDLY MUTTERED " ABSURD " AS SCHRODER AND

OTHER FOREIGN MINISTERS PRESSED THEIR CASE . HOWEVER, SCHRODER HAD A

POTENT WEAPON . FRANCE, EUROPE'S LOWEST-COST AGRICULTURAL PRODUCER, IS

DEMANDING THAT THE SIX ADOPT A UNIFORM POLICY ON FARM PRICES BY JULY .

SINCE GERMANY WOULD BE FORCED TO FIND NEW WORK FOR AT LEAST A MILLION

OF ITS HIGH-COST FARMERS IF THIS HAPPENS, SCHRODER WARNED THAT HIS

GOVERNMENT WOULD FRUSTRATE ANY ATTEMPT TO ADOPT A COMMON AGRICULTURAL

POLICY UNLESS FRANCE IN RETURN AGREES TO SEEK THE BROAD RECIPROCAL

TARIFF CUTS THAT THE OTHER COMMON MARKET NATIONS HOPE TO ACHIEVE IN

NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE U.S . SIXES & SEVENS . THE MOST EXPLOSIVE ISSUE

WAS A DEMAND BY A MAJORITY OF COMMON MARKET NATIONS THAT THE COMMUNITY

FORM A PERMANENT COMMITTEE TO MAINTAIN CONSULTATION WITH BRITAIN .

AFTER INSISTING THAT THE PALAIS DES CONGRES CAUCUS ROOM BE CLEARED OF

ADVISERS INCLUDING SEVERAL AMBASSADORS COUVE DE MURVILLE SAID FURIOUSLY

THAT BRITAIN HAD BEEN TRYING TO UNDERMINE THE COMMON MARKET EVER SINCE

DE GAULLE'S VETO . SAID HE : " FRANCE CANNOT POSSIBLY ACCEPT THIS

BRITISH BEHAVIOR . " BUT THE SHOCK WAVES HAVE SPREAD FAR BEYOND THE

COMMON MARKET . BRITAIN, WHICH ONLY FOUR MONTHS AGO HAD SUCH FAITH IN

EUROPE THAT IT WAS READY TO SUNDER ITS TIES WITH THE COMMONWEALTH AND

WITH THE EUROPEAN FREE TRADE ASSOCIATION, HAD TO SWALLOW ITS PRIDE IN

LISBON LAST WEEK AND MAKE A DESPERATE EFFORT EVEN TO KEEP EFTA TOGETHER

AT ITS FIRST TOP-LEVEL MEETING SINCE FEBRUARY . THE REASON IS THAT

BRITAIN'S GOVERNMENT HAS ACCEPTED THE FACT THAT IT WILL PROBABLY NOT

ENTER EUROPE DURING DE GAULLE'S LIFETIME AND, IF THE COMMON MARKET

SHOULD STAGNATE, MAY NEVER JOIN . FRANCE'S DESIGN FOR A NARROW,

PROTECTIONIST, THIRD-FORCE EUROPE HAS HAD ITS MOST TRAUMATIC EFFECT ON

WASHINGTON, WHICH EVER SINCE WORLD WAR II HAS TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT

THE U.S . AND EUROPE HAVE COMMON IDEALS AND INTERESTS . LAST WEEK, ON

THE EVE OF A MINISTERIAL CONFERENCE TO DISCUSS THE SCOPE AND APPROACH

OF THE KENNEDY ROUND OF TARIFF CUTS, IT WAS ALREADY PLAIN THAT FRANCE

IS AGAIN DETERMINED TO SEEK ITS OWN NARROW SELF-INTEREST, WITHOUT

REGARD FOR ITS COMMON MARKET PARTNERS AND WITH EVERY INTENTION OF

BLOCKING U.S . HOPES OF EXPANDING TRADE WITH THE NEW EUROPE . INDEED,

AS LONG AS THE INNER SIX ARE SPLINTERED AND THE SEVEN REMAIN OUTER,

THERE WILL BE NO NEW EUROPE .

RUSSIA TWO ON TRIAL NEITHER OF THE MEN WHO GLARED AT EACH OTHER

ACROSS THE PRISONER'S DOCK IN A CROWDED MOSCOW COURTROOM LOOKED VERY

MUCH LIKE A SPY . DAPPER GREVILLE MAYNARD WYNNE, 44, WAS A SALESMAN WHO

LIVED QUIETLY IN LONDON'S FASHIONABLE CHELSEA SECTION WITH HIS WIFE AND

YOUNG SON WHEN HE WAS NOT ON THE ROAD SELLING ELECTRICAL MACHINERY IN

RUSSIA AND EASTERN EUROPE . SLENDER OLEG PENKOVSKY, 44, WAS A

MUCHDECORATED RUSSIAN WAR HERO WHO RECENTLY HAD HELD THE DELICATE JOB

OF ARRANGING EAST-WEST SCIENTIFIC EXCHANGES FOR A SOVIET STATE

COMMITTEE . BUT LAST WEEK THE INCONGRUOUS PAIR WENT ON TRIAL FOR

ESPIONAGE BEFORE A MILITARY PANEL OF THREE SOVIET SUPREME COURT

GENERALS . WHILE KLIEG LIGHTS GLARED AND SOME 300 PERSPIRING SPECTATORS

SAT ON THE EDGE OF THEIR SEATS FOR FIVE DAYS, THE MOST BIZARRE SPY

CIRCUS IN POSTWAR SOVIET HISTORY UNFOLDED BEFORE THEIR EYES . IF THE

TWO MEN'S CONFESSIONS COULD BE BELIEVED, THE WEST HAD PULLED OFF A

SPECTACULAR COUP IN THE COLD WAR STRUGGLE FOR INTELLIGENCE SECRETS .

FOR 18 STRAIGHT MONTHS, FROM APRIL 1961 UNTIL LAST OCTOBER, PENKOVSKY

HAD FUNNELED TO WYNNE AND OTHER COURIERS A STREAM OF NEARLY 5,000

PHOTOGRAPHS OF SECRET SOVIET DATA ON MISSILE DEVELOPMENTS, TROOP

MOVEMENTS, ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL INSIDE STUFF FROM THE COMMUNIST PARTY

CENTRAL COMMITTEE ITSELF . JUST A CHAUFFEUR . IT BEGAN IN NOVEMBER

1960, WHEN PENKOVSKY GOT FED UP WITH HIS MOSCOW JOB . SEEKING " THE

EASY LIFE, " PENKOVSKY SAID HE SENT A LETTER TO THE U.S . EMBASSY IN

MOSCOW, OFFERING HIS SERVICES TO THE U.S . ACCORDING TO PENKOVSKY,

OFFICIALS IN WASHINGTON IGNORED THE OFFER, FEARING A TRAP . BUT

PENKOVSKY WAS DETERMINED TO WORK FOR THE WEST . HIS CHANCE CAME AT LAST

WHEN HE STRUCK UP A CONVERSATION WITH WYNNE THE FOLLOWING MONTH AT A

MOSCOW RECEPTION FOR VISITING BRITISH TECHNICIANS . WYNNE WAS HAPPY TO

MEET THE RUSSIAN, HE SAID, BECAUSE SOVIET CONTACTS WERE USEFUL FOR HIS

MACHINERY BUSINESS . THUS, WHEN PENKOVSKY SHOWED UP NEXT APRIL IN

LONDON, SUPPOSEDLY TO SET UP AN EXCHANGE WITH BRITISH SCIENTISTS, WYNNE

WENT OUT TO THE AIRPORT TO MEET HIM AND SHOW HIM AROUND TOWN . WERE YOU

MERELY A CHAUFFEUR ? ASKED THE PROSECUTOR . THAT'S IT, WYNNE REPLIED

. EXPLODED PENKOVSKY TO THE COURT : " THIS IS A CHILD'S TALE . BELIEVE

ME, CITIZEN JUDGES, I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY WYNNE TRIES TO MINIMIZE HIS

ROLE . I DIDN'T NEED A CHAUFFEUR . I COULD HAVE TAKEN A TAXI . " TRUTH

WAS, SAID PENKOVSKY, HE WAS ALREADY RELAYING FILM TO BRITISH

INTELLIGENCE, AND NOW WAS IN TOUCH WITH THE AMERICANS AS WELL . IN

LONDON HE DELIVERED TWO BULKY PACKAGES OF STATE SECRETS TO WYNNE, TRIED

ON BRITISH AND U.S . COLONELS' UNIFORMS JUST IN CASE HE DECIDED TO

DEFECT, EVEN DISCUSSED A POSSIBLE ESCAPE FROM RUSSIA BY SUBMARINE IF

THINGS GOT HOT . HE RECALLED MORE RELAXED MOMENTS PUB-CRAWLING AND

NIGHTCLUBBING . BOX OF CHOCOLATES . AFTER LONDON, THERE WAS PARIS .

WYNNE GAILY SHOWED THE RUSSIAN AROUND FONTAINEBLEAU, VERSAILLES, THE

LIDO AND THE MOULIN ROUGE AND WILLINGLY PICKED UP THE TAB . PENKOVSKY

HANDED OVER 15 MORE ROLLS OF FILM AND HAD FIVE SESSIONS WITH WESTERN

INTELLIGENCE AGENTS . ON OCCASIONS WHEN WYNNE CAME TO MOSCOW ON A

BUSINESS TRIP, PENKOVSKY USUALLY PASSED HIS INFORMATION TO HIM

CONCEALED IN A BOX OF CHOCOLATES, WHICH WYNNE ALLEGEDLY GAVE TO MRS .

JANET CHISHOLM, WIFE OF A SECOND SECRETARY OF THE BRITISH EMBASSY, FOR

RELAY TO LONDON . WHEN MRS . CHISHOLM SUSPECTED SHE WAS BEING FOLLOWED,

SHE SUGGESTED THAT WYNNE GIVE THE " CHOCOLATES " TO HER CHILDREN . ON

HIS FLIGHTS OUT OF MOSCOW, WYNNE CARRIED BOOK-SIZE PACKAGES OF SECRETS

WRAPPED IN PLAIN BROWN PAPER . PENKOVSKY SAID THAT WHEN HE DID NOT HAVE

WYNNE AROUND TO ACT AS COURIER, HE USED HIS CODE NAME, " YOUNG, " AND

DEALT DIRECTLY WITH U.S . AND BRITISH EMBASSY EMPLOYEES THROUGH AN

ELABORATE SET OF SIGNALS AND TELEPHONE CODES . IT ALL WORKED FINE UNTIL

LAST FALL WHEN THE SOVIET POLICE SWOOPED DOWN ON PENKOVSKY, EXTRACTING

THE CONFESSION THAT IMPLICATED WYNNE . A FEW DAYS LATER, RUSSIA'S

AGENTS LOCATED WYNNE IN BUDAPEST AND HUSTLED HIM BACK TO MOSCOW .

LEARNING FROM EXPERIENCE . THROUGH IT ALL, WYNNE DOGGEDLY MAINTAINED

THAT HE WAS ONLY A BUSINESSMAN WHO HAD BEEN SNARED IN THE COILS OF

BRITISH INTELLIGENCE . AT FIRST, HE SAID, HE HAD NO IDEA WHAT THE BROWN

PACKAGES OR BOXES OF CHOCOLATE REALLY CONTAINED . AFTER IT DAWNED ON

HIM THAT HE WAS A SPY, HE DEMANDED NO PART OF THE " DIRTY BUSINESS, "

BUT HIS SUPERIORS THREATENED TO WRECK HIS COMMERCIAL AFFAIRS, AND SO HE

KEPT AT IT . " MY ANSWERS MIGHT SEEM NAIVE TO YOU PROFESSIONAL

GENTLEMEN HERE, " HE SAID, TO THE LAUGHTER OF THE COURTROOM, " BUT I

HAD NO IDEA HOW INTELLIGENCE OPERATED, I NOW KNOW EVEN BEFORE THE

PROSECUTOR FINISHED HIS SUMMATION AT THE END OF THE TRIAL, THE

GOVERNMENT NEWSPAPER IZVESTIA APPEARED IN THE COURTROOM REPORTING HIS

DEMAND FOR PUNISHMENT : A DEATH SENTENCE FOR PENKOVSKY AND TEN YEARS

IN JAIL FOR WYNNE . THE MILITARY TRIBUNAL RETIRED TO CONFER, THEN

PASSED JUDGMENT . PENKOVSKY WOULD BE SHOT ; WYNNE WOULD DO EIGHT YEARS

1 BERLIN 2-12 TWO INCHES TO SAFETY SINCE THE HATED WALL WENT UP IN

1961, ESCAPEES HAVE INGENIOUSLY GOTTEN PAST IT BY TUNNELING, CLIMBING,

JUMPING, OR BY JUST KNOCKING IT DOWN . LAST WEEK A YOUNG AUSTRIAN

OUTDID THEM ALL, SMUGGLING OUT HIS PRETTY FIANCEE AND HER MOTHER

THROUGH THE SIMPLE EXPEDIENT OF KEEPING HIS HEAD DOWN . HEINZ MEIXNER,

20, HAD MOVED TO WEST BERLIN TWO YEARS AGO TO TAKE A JOB AS A LATHE

WORKER . AS A FOREIGNER, HE WAS ABLE TO CROSS THE LINE FREELY INTO EAST

BERLIN, WHERE, AT A STUDENTS' DANCE LAST SEPTEMBER, HE FELL IN LOVE

WITH TINY, ATTRACTIVE MARGARETE THURAU . WHEN MARGARETE APPLIED FOR

PERMISSION TO EMIGRATE TO AUSTRIA, COMMUNIST POLICE TOLD HER THAT SHE

SHOULD MARRY HER YOUNG MAN IN EAST BERLIN AND SETTLE DOWN THERE . THIS

WAS MORE THAN MEIXNER COULD BEAR . " AS SOON AS I HEARD THAT, " SAYS

MEIXNER, " I MADE UP MY MIND TO GET HER OUT . " LAST EXIT . HE LAID HIS

PLANS WITH METICULOUS CARE . TO GET A GOOD LOOK AT THE COMMUNIST SIDE

OF THE FRIEDRICHSTRASSE CROSSING POINT FOR FOREIGNERS, MEIXNER STALLED

HIS MOTOR SCOOTER NEAR THE PEPPERMINT-STRIPED STEEL BEAM THAT CLOSES

THE LAST EXIT IN THE WALL . PRETENDING TO HAVE ENGINE TROUBLE, HE

MEASURED THE HEIGHT OF THE BARRIER, FOUND THAT IT WAS ONLY 37F IN .

FROM THE GROUND . HIS NEXT STEP WAS TO SEARCH THE CAR RENTAL AGENCIES

IN WEST BERLIN FOR A SPORTS CAR SMALL ENOUGH TO SLIP UNDER THE BEAM .

HE FINALLY DECIDED ON AN AUSTIN HEALEY SPRITE, WHICH, WITHOUT ITS

WINDSHIELD, MEASURED 35F IN . HIGH . MEIXNER CONFIDED IN ANOTHER YOUNG

AUSTRIAN, GAVE HIM AN EXACT TIMETABLE OF HIS PLANS AND ASKED HIM TO

PREVENT ANY CARS ON THE WESTERN SIDE FROM STARTING INTO THE BARRIER

AREA AT THE CRITICAL MOMENT . AT LAST, WHEN HIS PLANS WERE COMPLETE,

MEIXNER DROVE HIS LITTLE SPORTS CAR BACK INTO EAST BERLIN TO

MARGARETE'S HOUSE . MARGARETE CROUCHED IN THE NARROW SPACE BEHIND THE

DRIVER'S SEAT ; HER MOTHER WAS WEDGED INTO THE LUGGAGE COMPARTMENT . "

LUCKILY, " SAYS PETITE MARGARETE, " MOTHER IS JUST LIKE ME . " LEAVING

NOTHING TO CHANCE, MEIXNER ALSO LET AIR OUT OF HIS TIRES TO LOWER THE

CAR . SHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT, MEIXNER DROVE TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE

FRONTIER AREA, SHOWED HIS AUSTRIAN PASSPORT TO A GUARD, WHO WAVED HIM

ON TO THE CUSTOMS

OFFICER . BRICKS FOR MAMMA . IT WAS THE TIME FOR ACTION . INSTEAD OF

PULLING UP AT THE CUSTOMS SHED, MEIXNER GUNNED HIS MOTOR, SKIDDED

AROUND THE SLALOM BARRIERS, AND SHOT PAST THE STARTLED GUARD . LOOMING

BEFORE HIM WAS THAT LAST BAR . FOR ONE TERRIFYING MOMENT, IT SEEMED TOO

LOW TO CLEAR . BUT HE HAD MEASURED WELL . JAMMING HIS FOOT ON THE

ACCELERATOR, MEIXNER DUCKED HIS HEAD AND WHIZZED INTO WEST BERLIN . BY

THE TIME HE GOT THERE, HE WAS GOING SO FAST THAT HE LEFT A 96-FT . SKID

MARK WHEN HE JAMMED ON THE BRAKES . SAFE WITH HIS PASSENGERS, MEIXNER

EXPLAINED HIS ESCAPE PLAN TO STARTLED WEST BERLIN POLICE : " I FIGURED

IT WOULD TAKE THE VOPOS THREE SECONDS TO DRAW THEIR WEAPONS ONCE THEY

REALIZED WHAT I WAS DOING . BUT I THOUGHT I COULD MAKE IT IN THOSE

THREE SECONDS . BESIDES, WE HAD 30 BRICKS BEHIND MRS . THURAU TO

PROTECT HER IF FIRING STARTED . /

GREAT BRITAIN YER PAYS YER MONEY, YER TYKES YER CHOICE

PSEPHOLOGY, AS GUESSING ELECTIONS IS CALLED IN BRITAIN, IS ABOUT AS

INEXACT AN ART AS PLAYING THE FOOTBALL POOLS . FACED WITH A GENERAL

ELECTION THIS YEAR OR NEXT, THE EXPERTS LAST WEEK STUDIED A RICH CROP

OF AUGURIES WITH UNUSUAL DILIGENCE AND THE USUAL RESULTS : THEY

DISAGREED . CERTAINLY, THERE WAS LITTLE TO ENCOURAGE PRIME MINISTER

HAROLD MACMILLAN'S CONSERVATIVES IN THE OUTCOME OF 401 LOCAL BOROUGH

ELECTIONS . WITH 2,973 SEATS AT STAKE, THE TORIES LOST A TOTAL OF 550

; THE LABOR PARTY GAINED 544, WINNING CONTROL OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN

SUCH MAJOR CITIES AS LEICESTER, LIVERPOOL, BRADFORD, BRISTOL AND

NOTTINGHAM . LABOR OFFICIALS CLAIMED THAT IF A GENERAL ELECTION WERE

HELD TOMORROW, THEY WOULD RETURN TO POWER WITH A MARGIN OF 90 TO 130

SEATS . ALSO LAST WEEK, HOWEVER, THREE SEPARATE OPINION POLLS INDICATED

THAT LABOR'S LEAD HAS SHORTENED DRAMATICALLY IN THE PAST MONTH . A

DAILY MAIL SURVEY ESTIMATED THAT TORY SUPPORT HAS INCREASED A STARTLING

7 PER CENT SINCE APRIL . THE DAILY TELEGRAPH GALLUP POLL REPORTED A 2.5

PER CENT GAIN FOR THE CONSERVATIVES, WHOSE SUPPORT IS NOW ESTIMATED AT

36.5 PER CENT, TO LABOR'S 46.5 PER CENT THE CLUES WERE NOT QUITE AS

CONTRADICTORY AS THEY SEEMED . COUNCIL ELECTIONS IN BRITAIN GENERALLY

MIRROR LOCAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS . WHILE TORY CANDIDATES WERE HURT BY

HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS IN MANY BIG CITIES, THEY ALSO TOOK A BEATING

IN MANY PROSPEROUS SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES WHERE HOUSEHOLDERS WERE STILL

CROSS WITH THE GOVERNMENT FOR RECENTLY INCREASING THEIR LOCAL TAXES

(FROM 50 PER CENT TO 300 PER CENT ) . NATIONAL OPINION POLLS, WHICH IN

THE PAST HAVE PROVED FAIRLY ACCURATE, APPARENTLY REFLECTED BRITONS'

SATISFACTION WITH A NEW HEAD OF STEAM THAT HAS BEGUN TO APPEAR IN THE

ECONOMY . TORN BETWEEN CONTRADICTORY PORTENTS, PSEPHOLOGISTS AND

POLITICIANS WERE ABOUT EQUALLY DIVIDED ON WHETHER THE GENERAL ELECTION

WILL BE HELD THIS FALL OR NEXT YEAR .

MUSSOLINI, YOU'RE MRS . SWEENY, YOU'RE CAMEMBERT . BACK IN 1935, WHEN

COLE PORTER'S ANYTHING GOES WAS THE HOTTEST TICKET IN TOWN, MARGARET

WHIGHAM SWEENY WAS MORE TOP THAN MICKEY MOUSE OR A COOLIDGE DOLLAR .

CHIC, BEAUTIFUL AND RICH IN HER OWN RIGHT, THE 21-YEAR-OLD ENGLISH

BEAUTY WAS MARRIED TO GENTLEMAN GOLFER CHARLES SWEENY, FOR WHOM, THE

GOSSIP COLUMNISTS INSISTED, SHE HAD JILTED THE YOUNG EARL OF WARWICK .

THAT SAME YEAR IAN CAMPBELL MADE HEADLINES BY TAKING AS HIS SECOND WIFE

LOUISE VANNECK, DAUGHTER OF U.S . SCULPTOR HENRY CLEWS . (HIS FIRST :

JANET AITKEN, LORD BEAVERBROOK'S DAUGHTER.) THOUGH UNMENTIONED IN THE

SONG, CAMPBELL WAS EVEN MORE TOP THAN MRS . SWEENY . IN 1949 HE BECAME

DUKE OF ARGYLL (FAMILY MOTTO : " FORGET NOT " ), CHIEF OF CLAN

CAMPBELL, HEREDITARY MASTER OF THE KING'S HOUSEHOLD IN SCOTLAND,

ADMIRAL OF THE WESTERN COASTS AND ISLES, HEREDITARY SHERIFF OF ARGYLL,

KEEPER OF DUNSTAFFNAGE, CARRICK, TARBERT AND DUNOON CASTLES, AND HEIR

TO A BURKE'S DOZEN EARLDOMS, VISCOUNTCIES, MARQUISATES AND BARONETCIES

. FAVORED FOUR . IN 1951, TWO WEEKS AFTER A LURID DIVORCE FROM LOUISE,

THE DUKE MARRIED MRS . SWEENY . LAST WEEK IN EDINBURGH, THE TOPPERS TOO

WERE DIVORCED . THEIR DECREE, 65,000 WORDS LONG, TOOK THE JUDGE, LORD

WHEATLEY, 4F HOURS TO READ THROUGH . IT WAS NO COLE PORTER LYRIC . ON

THE BASIS OF THE EVIDENCE, DECLARED THE JUDGE, THE DUCHESS, NOW 49, "

WAS A COMPLETELY PROMISCUOUS WOMAN WHOSE SEXUAL APPETITE COULD ONLY BE

SATISFIED BY A NUMBER OF MEN . " HE NAMED FOUR SPECIFIC ADULTERERS :

JOHN COHANE, 50, A U.S . BUSINESSMAN LIVING IN IRELAND WHOM THE COURT

DESCRIBED AS A " SELF-CONFESSED WOLF " WITH " THE MORALS OF A TOMCAT "

; HARVEY COMBE, 37, ONETIME PRESS OFFICER AT LONDON'S SAVOY HOTEL ;

BARON SIGISMUND VON BRAUN, 52, BROTHER OF ROCKET SCIENTIST WERNHER, WHO

WAS COUNSELOR OF WEST GERMANY'S LONDON EMBASSY UNTIL 1958, AND IS NOW

HIS GOVERNMENT'S U.N . OBSERVER IN NEW YORK ; AND AN UNIDENTIFIED

PARTNER WHO HAD BEEN PHOTOGRAPHED IN THE NUDE WITH THE DUCHESS . THE

JUDGE DID NOT SPARE THE DUKE, WHO, HE SAID, ADMITTED THAT HE HAD SHOWN

/ PORNOGRAPHIC PHOTOGRAPHS " TO " A MIXED GATHERING IN NEW YORK AND

SEEMED TO TREAT IT AS A JOKE . " ADDED THE JUDGE : " I DO NOT COMMEND

HIS STANDARD OF TASTE AND HABITS . " HOME WITH HARVEY . THOUGH ARGYLL

HAD ALREADY DISCOVERED SUSPICIOUS LETTERS TO HIS WIFE AND A DIARY

INSCRIBED WITH " CRYPTIC " SIGNALS, HE " SUCCUMBED TO HER CHARMS, " AS

THE COURT PUT IT . THUS, THE DUKE, SAID JUDGE WHEATLEY, HAD " CONDONED

/ HIS WIFE'S ADULTERY WITH VON BRAUN BY RESUMING MARITAL RELATIONS WITH

HER IN PARIS . THE DIVORCE WAS GRANTED ON THE GROUNDS OF HER ADULTERY

IN 1960 WITH HARVEY COMBE AT THE ARGYLLS' LONDON HOUSE IN UPPER

GROSVENOR STREET . THE ARGYLLS' LITIGATION, WHICH HAD DRAGGED ON FOR 3F

YEARS, WAS THE LONGEST, MOST EXPENSIVE (ESTIMATED COST : $140,000) AND

MOST SENSATIONAL IN SCOTTISH HISTORY . AND IT MAY NOT BE OVER, SINCE

THE DUCHESS HAS SAID THAT SHE PLANS TO APPEAL THE COURT'S VERDICT . IN

ANY CASE, SHE STILL FACES CHARGES OF LIBEL AND CONSPIRACY TO SUSTAIN A

MALICIOUS CHARGE OF ADULTERY, STEMMING FROM HER OWN DIVORCE PETITION

AGAINST THE DUKE, WHICH SHE DROPPED LAST MAY . IN THAT SUIT, SHE

ACCUSED HER HUSBAND OF COMMITTING ADULTERY WITH HER STEPMOTHER .

ALGERIA A HEX ? THINGS BEGAN GOING WRONG ALMOST FROM THE

MOMENT GAMAL ABDEL NASSER SAILED INTO ALGIERS HARBOR TO BEGIN HIS STATE

VISIT . THE DAY HE ARRIVED, AN ALGERIAN MINESWEEPER THAT HAD ESCORTED

NASSER'S YACHT SANK WITH THE LOSS OF THREE CREWMEN . THEN A PALL WAS

CAST OVER THE CELEBRATIONS BY THE DEATH OF ALGERIA'S FOREIGN MINISTER

MOHAMMED KHEMISTI, WHO HAD BEEN SHOT BY A CRAZED ASSASSIN (SEE

MILESTONES) . ON TOP OF ALL THAT, A MOST UNUSUAL TORNADO SWEPT ACROSS

THE COUNTRY, KILLING TWELVE ALGERIANS IN ONE VILLAGE . MANY A

SUPERSTITIOUS ALGERIAN PEASANT WAS CONVINCED THAT THE EGYPTIAN VISITOR

HAD BROUGHT A HEX WITH HIM . BUT THERE WAS A MORE CONCRETE REASON FOR

THE DISAPPOINTMENT NASSER TOOK WITH HIM LAST WEEK WHEN HE PULLED UP

ANCHOR AND SAILED AWAY THREE DAYS EARLIER THAN PLANNED . FROM HOST

AHMED BEN BELLA, ALGERIA'S YOUNG PREMIER, NASSER HAD GOTTEN HEARTY

CORDIALITY AND WORDS OF ACCLAIM, BUT NO REAL PROMISE TO BRING ALGERIA

INTO NASSER'S SCHEME FOR A UNITED ARAB REPUBLICSCIPLE . AS THE ONLY TWO

SOCIALIST RULERS IN THE ARAZ WORLD, THEY HAD MUCH IN COMMON . AND BEN

BELLA WAS DULY GRATEFUL TO NASSER FOR HIS AID IN THE LONG STRUGGLE

AGAINST FRANCE . BUT AT THE CONFERENCE TABLE, NASSER FOUND BEN BELLA TO

BE NO FAWNING DISCIPLE . COOL, TOUGH AND INDEPENDENT, THE ALGERIANS

APPEARED MORE INTERESTED IN THEIR OWN REVOLUTION THAN IN MORE GRANDIOSE

SCHEMES . TEN MONTHS AFTER INDEPENDENCE, ALGERIA'S 46-YEAR-OLD BACHELOR

PREMIER IS BUSY CONSOLIDATING PERSONALIZED CONTROL OVER HIS RESTIVE

LAND . LAST MONTH HE ELIMINATED HIS MOST DANGEROUS RIVAL, OLD

REVOLUTIONARY COMRADE MOHAMMED KHIDER, BY FORCING HIM OUT AS

SECRETARY-GENERAL OF ALGERIA'S RULING NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT . BEN

BELLA TOOK OVER THE PARTY POST HIMSELF . ALSO, BEN BELLA IS IMPLANTING

HIS OWN BRAND OF " ARAB SOCIALISM . " HE HAS NATIONALIZED ONE-THIRD OF

ALGERIA'S FARM LAND, MOST OF IT FRENCH-OWNED, AND HANDED IT TO "

MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES " OF TURBANED PEASANTS . HIS REGIME HAS SEIZED

SCORES OF CINEMAS, HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS FROM ALGERIANS WHO, IN BEN

BELLA'S WORDS, " FATTENED THEMSELVES LIKE PASHAS " BY BUYING UP

PROPERTY FROM FLEEING FRENCHMEN . UNSPOKEN ALLIANCE . BUT BEN BELLA'S

BRAND OF SOCIALISM HAS DISTINCT LIMITS . ALGERIA'S CHIEF ALLIANCE IS A

STRANGE, UNSPOKEN ONE, NOT WITH THE COMMUNISTS OR WITH ANY ARAB LAND .

IT IS WITH FRANCE, ALGERIA'S ONETIME OVERLORD . AS IF TO MAKE CLEAR ITS

CONTINUED ENDORSEMENT OF BEN BELLA, FRANCE RECENTLY AGREED TO SPEED UP

PAYMENT OF ITS SUBSIDIES TO ALGERIA, BUDGETED FOR $210 MILLION THIS

YEAR, WHICH COMPRISE BEN BELLA'S CHIEF ECONOMIC SUPPORT . IN RETURN,

ALGERIA PROMISES TO USE ONE-FIFTH OF THE TOTAL TO COMPENSATE

EXPROPRIATED FRENCH LANDLORDS .

SYRIA TO UNITY BY DISUNION IN CAIRO LAST WEEK, EGYPT'S NO . 2 MAN,

FIELD MARSHAL ABDEL HAKIM AMER, STORMED AT A SYRIAN DELEGATION : " IS

NASSERISM A CRIME IN SYRIA NOW ? IF IT IS, HOW CAN WE FACE THE FUTURE

TOGETHER ? IF THERE ARE IN DAMASCUS PEOPLE WHO CONSIDER NASSERISM A

CRIME, THEN HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO COOPERATE WITH THEM ? " WHAT SET

OFF AMER'S FLOOD OF RHETORICAL QUESTIONS WAS THE THREAT POSED TO

NASSER'S DREAM OF ARAB UNITY BY THE GYRATIONS OF SYRIA'S BAATH PARTY

LEADERS, HEADED BY TALL, LUGUBRIOUS PREMIER SALAH BITAR . THE BAATH

LEADERSHIP WANTS ARAB UNITY AS MUCH AS DOES NASSER, BUT IT HAS REFUSED

TO LET THE PARTY BE DROWNED IN AN ALLENCOMPASSING NASSERITE NATIONAL

FRONT . THE CONFLICT BECAME ACUTE LAST MONTH WHEN THE REGIME BEGAN

PURGING THE SYRIAN ARMY OF PRO-NASSER OFFICERS AND NONCOMS . IN

RETALIATION, SIX NASSERITE CABINET MINISTERS RESIGNED . WHILE STUDENTS

STAGED SITINS IN THE SCHOOLS, PRO-NASSER MOBS POURED INTO THE STREETS

OF DAMASCUS AND ALEPPO, WHERE SCORES OF DEMONSTRATORS WERE KILLED OR

WOUNDED BATTLING SOLDIERS AND POLICE . AS THE VIOLENCE IN THE STREETS

GREW WORSE, THE BAATH LEADERS FACED THE PROSPECT OF DESTROYING ARAB

UNITY AND LOWERING THE PRESTIGE OF THEIR PARTY . LAST WEEK HARASSED,

MOURNFUL PREMIER BITAR FINALLY GAVE IN AND RESIGNED TO BE REPLACED BY A

COMPROMISE CANDIDATE, DR . SAMI JUNDI, 40, A DENTIST FROM HAMA WHO WAS

PREVIOUSLY MINISTER OF GUIDANCE AND CULTURE . THERE WAS SOME

POSSIBILITY THAT THE NEW PREMIER MIGHT BE ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH SIDES :

TO THE BAATHISTS BECAUSE JUNDI WAS ONCE A PARTY MEMBER AND HAD STOOD BY

THE GOVERNMENT ; TO THE NASSERITES BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN A LONGTIME

ADMIRER OF EGYPT'S STRONGMAN AND BELIEVES IN UNITY AT ALL COSTS . AT

WEEK'S END, THE REGIME IN NEIGHBORING IRAQ WAS ALSO GIVING GROUND TO

THE NASSERITES . THE ENTIRE BAATH-DOMINATED CABINET RESIGNED, BUT LEAN,

BALDING PREMIER HASSAN BAKR WAS COMMISSIONED TO FORM A NEW GOVERNMENT,

PRESUMABLY ONE WITH GREATER PRO-NASSER REPRESENTATION, WHICH MIGHT

FORESTALL STREET DEMONSTRATIONS AND DISAFFECTION IN THE ARMY .

SOUTH VIET NAM THE PINPRICK WAR LUMBERING LOW OVER STONE

AGE VILLAGES AND THICK JUNGLES, TROOP-CARRYING HELICOPTERS SWARMED

ACROSS THE WILD CENTRAL HIGHLANDS OF VIET NAM LAST WEEK . ON THE

GROUND, 10,000 SOUTH VIETNAMESE INFANTRYMEN AND MARINES SPREAD OUT OVER

A VAST, INHOSPITABLE SECTOR SOUTH OF TAMKY WHERE NO GOVERNMENT TROOPS

HAD SET FOOT SINCE 1938 . IN ONE OF THE BIGGEST DRIVES AGAINST THE

COMMUNIST VIET CONG SINCE THE GUERRILLA WAR BROKE OUT IN 1959, SOUTH

VIET NAM'S GOVERNMENT HOPED TO FLUSH SIX RED BATTALIONS AND A

HEADQUARTERS COMPANY FROM ITS LONGTIME STRONGHOLD IN THE MOUNTAINS .

MAIN OBJECT OF THE MONTH-LONG OPERATION WAS TO DESTROY VIET CONG FOOD

CACHES AND CUT THE REDS' MAIN SUPPLY LINE, THE 400-MILE HO CHI MINH

TRAIL TO NORTH VIET NAM THROUGH NEUTRAL LAOS . THE REDS HAD PLAINLY

EVACUATED THE AREA IN ADVANCE, BUT VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS EXPLAINED THAT

THEY DID NOT AIM TO KILL VIET CONG GUERRILLAS, ONLY TO ISOLATE THEM .

IF SUCCESSFUL, SAID ONE, THE SWEEP " WILL SOLVE 50 PER CENT OF OUR

MILITARY PROBLEMS IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS . " NOT SO, RETORTED SOME OF

THE U.S . OFFICERS WHO WERE TAKING PART . " IT WOULD TAKE A WHOLE U.S .

ARMY DIVISION TO BLOCK THAT TRAIL, " SAID ONE . THE CLASH OF OPINION

EXTENDS TO VIRTUALLY EVERY ASPECT OF THE FRUSTRATING, WEARISOME WAR IN

SOUTH VIET NAM AND REFLECTS ITS SHADOWY, HIDE-AND-SEEK NATURE . IT IS A

WAR WITH NO FRONT LINES AND NO DECISIVE BATTLES ; A WAR OF

CONTAINMENT, NOT OF CONQUEST ; A WAR OF LILLIPUTIAN PINPRICKS AND

BROBDINGNAGIAN STAKES . IT IS A DAY WAR AND A NIGHT WAR, IN WHICH THE

GOVERNMENT CONTROLS MOST HIGHWAYS AND WATERWAYS BY DAYLIGHT (THOUGH A

U.S . LIEUTENANT AND TWO VIETNAMESE SOLDIERS WERE KILLED IN A DAYLIGHT

ROADSIDE AMBUSH LAST WEEK), AND THE VIET CONG SLIP IN FROM JUNGLES AND

SWAMPS TO TAKE CHARGE AFTER DARK . IN THE RUGGED NORTH, IT IS A

MOUNTAIN WAR, IN WHICH THE REDS ARE SHORT OF FOOD, MEDICINE, WEAPONS,

AND LARGELY ON THE DEFENSIVE ; IN THE SOUTH, IT IS A BATTLE FOR THE

NATION'S RICE GRANARY, WHERE THE GUERRILLAS HAVE CUNNINGLY FOILED EVERY

GOVERNMENT ATTEMPT TO CLEAN THEM OUT . TURNING THE CORNER . HOW IS THE

WAR ACTUALLY GOING ? MEASURED AGAINST THE DESPERATE SITUATION THAT

FACED GENERAL MAXWELL TAYLOR ON A FACT-FINDING MISSION FOR THE

PRESIDENT 19 MONTHS AGO, THERE IS ROOM FOR QUALIFIED OPTIMISM . WHEN

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ROBERT MCNAMARA RETURNED FROM A CONFERENCE WITH

SERVICE CHIEFS IN PEARL HARBOR LAST WEEK, THE PENTAGON SAID " THE

CORNER HAS DEFINITELY BEEN TURNED TOWARD VICTORY . " NO ONE WAS SETTING

ANY TIMETABLE, BUT U.S . MILITARY CHIEFS AND SOUTH VIET NAM'S PRESIDENT

NGO DINH DIEM SAY THAT THE WAR SHOULD BE WON " WITHIN THREE YEARS . "

THERE ARE MANY SOLDIERS IN SOUTH VIET NAM WHO CONSIDER THIS WILDLY

OPTIMISTIC ; SOME BELIEVE THAT THE WAR MAY NEVER BE WON . BUT ALMOST

EVERYONE AGREES THAT THINGS HAVE IMPROVED . TODAY THERE IS LITTLE

DANGER THAT THE VIET CONG WILL TAKE OVER ANY OF SOUTH VIET NAM'S CITIES

. CAPTURED RED DOCUMENTS INDICATE THAT THEY HAVE GIVEN UP HOPE OF A

SWIFT CONQUEST, NOW AIM MERELY, AS THE GUERRILLAS' NORTH VIETNAMESE

BOSS HO CHI MINH SAID RECENTLY, " TO WAIT OUT THE AMERICANS . " THE

SOUTH VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT AND ITS 14,000 U.S . MILITARY " ADVISERS "

PIN THEIR HOPES ON AN INTEGRATED, LONG-TERM PLAN THAT AIMS AT ISOLATING

AND DRIVING OUT THE VIET CONG . BASIC ELEMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT'S

BATTLE PLAN IS TO RESETTLE ALMOST THE ENTIRE RURAL POPULATION IN SOME

12,000 " STRATEGIC HAMLETS, " WITH BAMBOO FENCES, BARBED WIRE AND ARMED

MILITIAMEN TO KEEP THE PREDATORY VIET CONG FROM EXACTING FOOD AND

MANPOWER FROM A HELPLESS PEASANTRY . ALREADY 8,000,000 VILLAGERS 59 PER

CENT OF SOUTH VIET NAM'S POPULATION ARE LIVING IN THE 6,000 HAMLETS

THAT HAVE SO FAR BEEN COMPLETED . PROBLEM WITH PEASANTS . THOUGH THE

GOVERNMENT ADMITS THAT FEWER THAN ONETHIRD OF THE HAMLETS ARE

DEFENSIBLE AGAINST A DETERMINED ONSLAUGHT, THE REDS ARE RELUCTANT TO

ATTACK THE VILLAGES FOR FEAR OF ANTAGONIZING THE PEOPLE . IN SOME

AREAS, THANKS TO HIGHER STANDARDS OF LIVING IN THE HAMLETS, PEASANTS

ARE FOR THE FIRST TIME INFORMING GOVERNMENT TROOPS OF THE MOVEMENTS OF

THE VIET CONG . " IF THESE PEOPLE BELIEVE WE CAN PROTECT THEM WITH THE

HAMLETS, " SAYS ONE U.S . ADVISER, " OUR PROBLEM MAY BE LICKED . "

HOWEVER, MOST SOUTH VIETNAMESE PEASANTS ARE STILL EITHER PASSIVE OR

ACTIVELY RESENTFUL OF THE DIEM REGIME, WHICH IS OFTEN PERSONIFIED BY

OPPRESSIVE, CORRUPT LOCAL ADMINISTRATORS . FOR ALL HIS HIGH HOPES FOR

THE PROGRAM, ALOOF, AUTOCRATIC PRESIDENT DIEM SELDOM STIRS FAR FROM HIS

YELLOW PALACE IN SAIGON TO VISIT THE HINTERLAND AND GENERATE ENTHUSIASM

FOR HIS CAUSE .

SNEAKY PETES . THE AREA OF THE GOVERNMENT'S GREATEST FRUSTRATION IS THE

MEKONG RIVER DELTA, WHERE 55 PER CENT OF SOUTH VIET NAM'S POPULATION IS

CENTERED AND 75 PER CENT OF ITS RICE IS GROWN . THE PEASANTS THERE HAVE

RESISTED THE HAMLET PROGRAM AND HAVE OFTEN BEEN FORCIBLY RESETTLED IN

FORTIFIED VILLAGES BECAUSE THEY RESENT HAVING TO WALK MILES TO THEIR

PADDIES . IN A SUCCESSFUL ATTACK ON TWO HAMLETS LAST MONTH, SOME 2,000

VILLAGERS SIMPLY VANISHED . THE REDS ARE PARTICULARLY HARD TO FLUSH OUT

OF THE DELTA BECAUSE THEY OFTEN ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH FROM

PEACEFUL PEASANTS . ON THE OTHER HAND, U.S . SPECIAL SERVICE TROOPS "

SNEAKY PETES " HAVE MADE DRAMATIC PROGRESS IN THE NORTH BY WINNING OVER

AND TRAINING THE DARK-SKINNED, ABORIGINAL MONTAGNARDS . THOUGH THEY

HAVE FOR CENTURIES BEEN VICTIMIZED BY THE LOWLAND VIETNAMESE, WHO

CONTEMPTUOUSLY CALL THEM MOI (SAVAGES), 150,000 MONTAGNARDS NOW BELONG

TO AN AGGRESSIVE, NATIVE FORCE . HELP FOR BANANAS . MILITARILY, THE

DECISIVE FACTOR IN THE WAR TO DATE HAS BEEN THE INTRODUCTION OF SOME

170 U.S.-PILOTED HELICOPTER TRANSPORTS, WHICH GIVE THE GOVERNMENT'S

TROOPS THE ADVANTAGES OF SURPRISE AND MOBILITY THAT HAD HITHERTO BEEN

THE GUERRILLAS' MONOPOLY . THE ANTIQUATED " BANANA " COPTERS HAVE

BECOME INCREASINGLY VULNERABLE AS THE VIET CONG LEARN HOW TO USE NEW

RAPID-FIRE WEAPONS ; IN ONE SORTIE NEAR THE DELTA VILLAGE OF APBAC

LAST JANUARY, THEY DOWNED FIVE OF 14 HELICOPTERS, INCLUDING ONE OF THE

24 FAST, ROCKET-FIRING HU-1B ( " HUEY " ) HELICOPTERS THAT NOW ESCORT

MOST MISSIONS . LAST WEEK A SECOND COMPANY OF 24 HUEYS ARRIVED AT A NEW

BASE NEAR VINH LONG . " OPERATIONS WERE DOWN IN THE HUNDREDS A YEAR

AGO, " SAYS GENERAL PAUL HARKINS, COMMANDER OF U.S . FORCES IN SOUTH

VIET NAM . " NOW THEY'RE IN THE THOUSANDS . " BUT NORMAL BATTLEFIELD

STATISTICS ARE LARGELY MEANINGLESS . THE VIET CONG'S CASUALTY RATE IS

RISING, BUT THE REDS HAVE ACTUALLY INCREASED THEIR HARD-CORE STRENGTH

(TO AN ESTIMATED 25,000) BY RECRUITING MORE PEASANTS . AND THOUGH THE

REDS ARE LOSING MANY WEAPONS, THOSE THAT THEY ARE CAPTURING ARE MODERN

MORTARS AND MACHINE GUNS, WHILE THOSE THAT THEY LOSE TO GOVERNMENT

FORCES ARE GENERALLY CRUDE DEVICES AND OBSOLETE RIFLES . VAIN PLEAS .

AS THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS BECOME MORE EFFICIENT, THE WILY VIET CONG ARE

ALSO LEARNING NEW TECHNIQUES . ONE OF THE VIET CONG'S LATEST TACTICS

HAS BEEN TO MOUNT A SERIES OF FEINTING ATTACKS ON A TARGET, THEN TO

WITHDRAW, LURING GOVERNMENT RESERVE FORCES INTO A WELL-LAID AMBUSH . AS

A RESULT, BADLY NEEDED REINFORCEMENTS OFTEN HANG BACK FOR FEAR OF

WALKING INTO A TRAP . SUCH A WAR IS A NEW AND FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE

FOR U.S . MILITARY ADVISERS . MINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT 73 AMERICANS

HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES IN THE FIGHTING SO FAR, THEIR MOST BITTER

COMPLAINT IS THAT MILITARY OPERATIONS ARE CONSTANTLY HOBBLED BY

POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS . THE BIG COMMAND DECISIONS HAVE TO BE CLEARED

WITH PRESIDENT DIEM, WHO STILL LEANS HEAVILY ON SUCH MEMBERS OF HIS

FAMILY AS BROTHER NGO DINH NHU, AND THE BEAUTEOUS MADAME NHU, FOR

ADVICE AND SUPPORT IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE COMMUNISTS . DIEM IS

MISTRUSTFUL OF MANY OF HIS BEST SOLDIERS AND FEARS ALSO THAT CONTINUED

HEAVY CASUALTIES WILL UNDERMINE WHAT PUBLIC SUPPORT HE ENJOYS . U.S .

OFFICERS HAVE PLEADED IN VAIN WITH DIEM TO ALLOW MORE SMALL-UNIT

SALLIES AND NIGHT OPERATIONS TO CHALLENGE THE VIET CONG'S AFTER-DARK

SUPREMACY . IN THEIR IMPATIENCE WITH DIEM, SOME EXASPERATED U.S .

OFFICIALS WISH THAT HE COULD BE REPLACED BY A MORE FLEXIBLE MAN . BUT

THEY ADMIT THAT THERE IS NO OTHER LEADER IN SIGHT . THE REGIME TENDS TO

EXAGGERATE ITS SUCCESSES AND MINIMIZE ITS FAILURES, INSISTS THAT ITS

AIRBORNE ATTACKS HAVE FINALLY " DISHEARTENED " THE REDS AND " CAUGHT

THEM OFF BALANCE . " MANY COMBAT-SEASONED U.S . ADVISERS THINK THAT

THIS IS HARDLY ENOUGH . " HELL, " SAYS ONE, " IF ALL WE DID WAS TO KEEP

THEM OFF BALANCE ON GUADALCANAL, WE'D STILL BE THERE . " THE ADVISORY

WAR . STRATEGICALLY AND POLITICALLY, OF COURSE, THE WAR FOR VIET NAM

HAS LITTLE IN COMMON WITH THE BATTLE OF GUADALCANAL . THE U.S . IS NOT

RUNNING THE WAR, BUT IS TRYING TO HELP A SENSITIVE YOUNG NATION TO WIN

FOR ITSELF . IT IS A GUERRILLA WAR IN WHICH, AS PRESIDENT DIEM SAYS, "

PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS " MAY PROVE MORE IMPORTANT THAN KILLING THE ENEMY

EVEN THOUGH, IN THE U.S . VIEW, HIS REGIME HAS DONE FAR TOO LITTLE, TOO

LATE, TO WIN THE SUPPORT OF THE RURAL POPULACE . AFTER PROLONGED

PRESSURE, THE GOVERNMENT AGREED ONLY LAST WEEK TO ASSUME THE $17

MILLION ANNUAL COST OF THE HAMLET PROGRAM THE U.S . IN ADDITION HAS

BEEN SPENDING $400 MILLION A YEAR IN SOUTH VIET NAM AND EVEN THIS

RELUCTANT DECISION BY DIEM WAS LARGELY INFLUENCED BY FEAR THAT THE

VILLAGERS WERE SHOWING GREATER LOYALTY TO U.S . ADMINISTRATORS THAN TO

THE REGIME . DISTRESSING AS THEY MAY BE, THE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION

BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS U.S . ADVISERS ARE UNLIKELY TO ABATE .

IN FACT, IF THE WAR TURNS MORE CLEARLY IN SOUTH VIET NAM'S FAVOR, THE

REGIME WILL PROBABLY BECOME MORE IMPATIENT OF U.S . ADVICE . FOR THE

VIETNAMESE, IT IS,

AFTER ALL, A WAR

FOR INDEPENDENCE .

SARAWAK THE RAJAH'S RETURN THE BROOKES OF

SARAWAK MIGHT HAVE STEPPED FROM THE PAGES OF A CONRAD NOVEL . THE FIRST

AND LAST ENGLISH FAMILY TO OCCUPY AN ORIENTAL THRONE, THEY FOUGHT

PIRATES AND HOSTILE SULTANS, PACIFIED HEAD-HUNTERS AND BROUGHT THE

WHITE MAN'S LAW TO THEIR CRUEL, VIBRANTLY BEAUTIFUL LAND IN NORTHWEST

BORNEO . THE BROOKE RAJAHS RULED THEIR KENTUCKY-SIZE KINGDOM WITH THE

STERN DIGNITY OF A VICTORIAN PATERFAMILIAS, BUT WITH HUMANITY AND

IMAGINATION AS WELL ; IN THE ANNALS OF COLONIALISM, FEW DYNASTIES HAVE

BEEN SO SELFLESSLY DEVOTED TO THEIR SUBJECTS' WELFARE . THE FIRST

BROOKE RAJAH WAS JAMES, A WEALTHY, HIGH-MINDED ADVENTURER WHO SAILED

OUT FROM ENGLAND TO " RID THE MALAY ARCHIPELAGO OF BARBARISM . " IN

SARAWAK HE FOUND HIS OPPORTUNITY . FOR THE SULTAN OF BRUNEI, HE SUBDUED

A STUBBORN CIVIL WAR BETWEEN THE MALAYS AND DYAKS . IN GRATITUDE FOR

HIS SERVICES (PLUS $2,000 OF BROOKE'S CASH), THE OPPRESSIVE SULTAN IN

1841 MADE HIM RAJAH OF SARAWAK . INDIFFERENT TO CROCODILES, BOA

CONSTRICTORS AND POISONED ARROWS, THE WHITE RAJAH LIVED ONLY FOR HIS

HANDSOME, AMIABLE PEOPLE . IN 1848 HE WAS KNIGHTED BY HER BRITANNIC

MAJESTY, AND IN 1864 BRITAIN RECOGNIZED HIS RAJ . HE DIED A BACHELOR IN

1868 AND WAS SUCCEEDED BY HIS NEPHEW CHARLES, WHO RULED FOR 50 YEARS .

RANEE PAN . THE RAJAH WHO BROUGHT SARAWAK INTO THE MODERN WORLD WAS

CHARLES BROOKE'S SON, WHO TOOK OVER IN 1917 . IN THE MORE HUMDRUM WORLD

OF THE 20TH CENTURY, WITTY, CAMBRIDGE-EDUCATED SIR CHARLES VYNER BROOKE

BECAME EVEN MORE OF A LEGEND THAN HIS PREDECESSORS . HE ISSUED HIS OWN

STAMPS, FLEW HIS OWN FLAG, MAINTAINED HIS OWN ARMY AND POLICE FORCE .

HIS RANEE WAS SYLVIA BRETT, THE BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER OF A VISCOUNT WHO,

IT WAS SAID, HAD BEEN SIR JAMES BARRIE'S INSPIRATION FOR PETER PAN .

ANOTHER LITERARY ADMIRER WAS GEORGE BERNARD SHAW . WHEN SYLVIA MARRIED

THE RAJAH IN 1911, HE WROTE : RIDE A COCK HORSE TO SARAWAK CROSS TO

SEE A YOUNG RANEE CONSUMED WITH REMORSE . SHE'LL HAVE BELLS ON HER

FINGERS, AND RINGS THROUGH HER NOSE, AND WON'T BE PERMITTED TO WEAR ANY

CLOTHES . THE BROOKES HAD THREE PRETTY DAUGHTERS, WHO GREW UP IN

ENGLAND AND WERE KNOWN TO EVERY TABLOID READER AS PRINCESS GOLD,

PRINCESS BABA AND PRINCESS PEARL . AT A GLITTERING SOCIETY WEDDING IN

1933, GOLD BECAME LADY INCHCAPE, BUT BABA AND PEARL WERE TOASTED IN

EVERY PUB WHEN THEY WERE MARRIED : BABA TO A WRESTLER, PEARL TO A

BANDLEADER .

STOCKPILING HEADS . THEIR FATHER

HAD LITTLE TIME FOR FRIVOLITY . A SHREWD, SELFEFFACING ADMINISTRATOR,

SIR CHARLES TRAVELED TO THE FAR CORNERS OF HIS LAND PERSUADING TRIBAL

CHIEFS TO END THEIR WARS AND FORSWEAR HEAD-HUNTING . WHEN THEY

PROTESTED THAT THEIR ENEMIES' HEADS WERE NEEDED TO PROPITIATE THE GODS,

THE RAJAH ORDERED HIS ENGLISH CIVIL SERVANTS TO STOCKPILE MUMMIFIED

LEFTOVERS FROM PREVIOUS WARS AND TO LEND THEM OUT TO THE VILLAGERS AS

NEEDED . FROM HIS HANDSOME RIVERSIDE FORTRESS IN KUCHING, HE BROUGHT

MODEST PROSPERITY TO THE KINGDOM BY EXPLOITING ITS OIL AND RUBBER

RESOURCES AS WELL AS DIAMONDS, BIRDS' NESTS (FOR CHINESE GOURMETS) AND

GUTTA-PERCHA (FOR GOLF BALLS) . IN 1941, CELEBRATING THE 100TH

ANNIVERSARY OF THE BROOKE

RAJ, SIR CHARLES GAVE

HIS PEOPLE A CONSTITUTION AND SET THEM ON THE ROAD TO SELF-GOVERNMENT .

CONTEMPLATING WAR-RAVAGED SARAWAK IN 1946, SIR CHARLES SADLY REALIZED

THAT HIS RAJ HAD BECOME AN ANACHRONISM IN THE POSTWAR WORLD . CEDING

SARAWAK TO BRITAIN, HE EXPLAINED THAT HIS PEOPLE WOULD FIND " NEW HOPE

IN AN ERA OF WIDENING ENLIGHTENMENT, STABILITY AND SOCIAL PROGRESS . "

ANOTHER CHANCE . WHEN SIR CHARLES RETIRED TO LONDON, WITH A $2.8

MILLION TRUST FUND THAT WILL ULTIMATELY REVERT TO SARAWAK, THE NATIVES

FOUGHT BITTERLY AGAINST BRITISH RULE, EVEN KILLED THE SECOND GOVERNOR,

WHO OCCUPIED THE BROOKES' OLD PALACE . THE COUNTRY HAS NEVER RECOVERED

FROM THE LOSS OF ITS LEADER . WHEN THE MALAYSIAN FEDERATION (TIME

COVER, APRIL 12) COMES INTO EXISTENCE IN AUGUST, STRIFETORN SARAWAK

WILL BE ONE OF ITS STATES AND WILL HAVE ITS BEST OPPORTUNITY YET TO

ACHIEVE PROSPERITY AND STABILITY . THE LAST WHITE RAJAH DID NOT LIVE TO

SEE THAT DAY . LAST WEEK, AT 88, SIR CHARLES VYNER BROOKE DIED IN HIS

LONDON HOME . WHEN THE NEWS REACHED SARAWAK, THE SPIRIT-WORSHIPING

DYAKS REJOICED, FOR THEY KNEW THAT HIS SOUL WOULD RETURN TO THE

STREAM-LACED LAND OF HIS FATHERS .

NOT TO BE CONFUSED, HOWEVER, WITH

HEMINGWAY'S FICTIONAL LADY BRETT ASHLEY OR THE REALLIFE SYLVIA ASHLEY .

NOT GUILTY OF THE CHARGES . WHEN HE SENT GENDARMES TO OVERTHROW

PRESIDENT LEOPOLD SENGHOR AND ARREST PRO-SENGHOR DEPUTIES, DIA SAID, HE

WAS ONLY TRYING TO HEAD OFF A PLOT AGAINST HIMSELF THAT STEMMED FROM

HIS EFFORTS TO CRACK SENEGAL'S PEANUT MONOPOLISTS . CRIED DIA : " I

WANTED A CONSTITUTIONAL SOLUTION, THEY (SENGHOR'S MEN) WANTED A

POLITICAL ONE . " IN REPLY, THE PROSECUTOR SOUNDED DOWNRIGHT

SYMPATHETIC . THERE WERE EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES, HE AGREED ; DIA

WAS OBVIOUSLY A MISGUIDED PATRIOT WHO " THOUGHT THAT ONE COULD NOT BE A

GOOD SENEGALESE WHEN ONE WAS AGAINST MAMADOU DIA . " BUT AT WEEK'S END

THE COURT GAVELED AN END TO COURTLINESS . AFTER TWO HOURS AND 15

GREY-UNIFORMED COPS STOOD GUARD 25 YARDS APART ALONG THE EIGHT-MILE

PARADE ROUTE . EMOTIONALLY, A RETIRED GREEK GENERAL ANNOUNCED THAT HE

WAS PERSONALLY READY TO SLASH HIS WRISTS TO GIVE BLOOD, IF DE GAULLE

WERE SHOT . MORE PRUDENTLY, GREECE'S PREMIER CONSTANTINE KARAMANLIS HAD

HIS OWN BLOOD TYPED, IN CASE HE GOT IN THE WAY OF ANY SHOOTING .

DRIFTING SMOKE . IN THE EVENT, THE PRECAUTIONS SEEMED EXCESSIVE . DE

GAULLE ARRIVED PROMPTLY AT NOON IN HIS BLUE-ANDWHITE CARAVELLE JET

AIRLINER, INSPECTED AN HONOR GUARD AS CANNON SMOKE FROM THE 21-GUN

SALUTE DRIFTED INTO HIS FACE, THEN CLIMBED INTO A ROLLS-ROYCE

CONVERTIBLE WITH GREECE'S TALL KING PAUL . AS THE MOTORCADE REACHED THE

CITY LIMITS, DE GAULLE JUMPED TO HIS FEET, WAVED THEATRICALLY TO THE

ATHENIANS GATHERED UNDER THE PEPPER TREES . AT HADRIAN'S ARCH, NEAR THE

TEMPLE OF OLYMPIAN ZEUS, HE SAID WITH FEELING : " NO FRENCHMAN,

ESPECIALLY MYSELF, COULD FAIL TO BE MOVED BY THIS CITY, NOR FORGET WHAT

HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED HERE FOR LIBERTY IN 3,000 YEARS . " THEN HE

PLUNGED NEARSIGHTEDLY INTO THE CURBSIDE CROWD TO SHAKE HANDS A

PROCEDURE THAT GIVES HIS SECURITY GUARDS PERPETUAL JITTERS . BUT THE

CHANCE OF A POTSHOT AT DE GAULLE WAS NOT THE ONLY WORRY OF GREEK

LEADERS . THE GOVERNMENT WAS ALSO UNEASY THAT DE GAULLE MIGHT TRY TO

EMBROIL GREECE IN HIS QUARREL WITH BRITAIN OVER THE COMMON MARKET, AND

WITH THE U.S . OVER NATO DEFENSE . IT WAS FRANCE, NOT GREECE, WHICH HAD

PUSHED THE TRIP . DE GAULLE HAD PICKED UP AN INVITATION MADE SEVEN

YEARS BEFORE TO THEN PRESIDENT RENE COTY . PARIS ALSO SUGGESTED THAT

THE FRENCH FLEET DROP ANCHOR IN THE PIRAEUS TO COINCIDE WITH DE

GAULLE'S ARRIVAL, AND DISCREETLY BROACHED THE PLAN OF HAVING DE GAULLE

ADDRESS THE GREEK PUBLIC, AS HE HAD DONE WITH SUCH SUCCESS DURING HIS

MIDDLE EAST FROM GOD, OR NASSER IT IS NEVER FUN TO BREAK UP

A VACATION AND RUSH HOME TO DEAL WITH SOME PROBLEM AT THE OFFICE . FOR

EGYPT'S GAMAL ABDEL NASSER, IT WAS ESPECIALLY PROVOKING, FOR HE WAS

ENJOYING SOME OF THE WORLD'S LOVELIEST SCENERY AT MARSHAL TITO'S VILLA

ON THE YUGOSLAV ISLAND OF BRIONI . BUT THE CABLES FROM CAIRO CARRIED

WORD THAT NASSER'S ARAB UNITY SCHEME WAS IN A STATE OF COLLAPSE .

RELUCTANTLY, EGYPT'S LEADER BOARDED A PLANE AND HEADED ACROSS THE

MEDITERRANEAN TO DEAL WITH HIS TROUBLEMAKING PARTNERS, THE SYRIANS .

BEHIND THE CRISIS WAS A GAMBLE THREE WEEKS AGO BY SYRIAN NASSERITES

THAT BY YANKING THEIR SIX MINISTERS FROM THE CABINET THEY COULD BRING

THE GOVERNMENT DOWN, TOUCH OFF STREET RIOTING, AND SNATCH CONTROL FROM

THE DOMINANT BAATH PARTY IN THE RESULTING CONFUSION . UP TO A POINT,

THAT WAS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED . BAATHIST PREMIER SALAH BITAR HAD TO

QUIT ; HIS REPLACEMENT WAS DR . SAMI JUNDI, SUPPOSEDLY A NASSER

ADMIRER . BUT AS IT TURNED OUT, JUNDI, AFTER THREE SLEEPLESS DAYS AND

NIGHTS OF TRYING TO PERSUADE BOTH SIDES TO COOPERATE, WEARILY STEPPED

ASIDE TO LET ANOTHER PREMIER SEEK A SOLUTION . WHO WAS THE NEW PREMIER

? NONE OTHER THAN BITAR, WHO PROMPTLY FILLED THE NASSERITE CABINET

VACANCIES WITH BAATH SUPPORTERS AND TIGHTENED THE PARTY'S GRIP OVER THE

ARMY, THUS COMPLETING A PURGE THAT HAD ALREADY SENT TWO PLANELOADS OF

OFFICERS SUSPECTED OF EGYPTIAN LEANINGS INTO EXILE . WITHIN HOURS OF

THE ANTINASSER STROKE IN SYRIA, MUCH THE SAME THING HAPPENED IN IRAQ .

THERE TWO NASSERITES WERE DUMPED FROM THE CABINET AND WERE REPLACED BY

MORE PLIABLE FELLOWS . CAIRO WAS ENRAGED AT BAATH'S " TRICKERY,

TREACHERY AND TERRORISM . " THUNDERED EGYPT'S AL GUMHURIA :. "

PUNISHMENT FROM GOD IS SURE TO COME . OR IF NOT FROM GOD, FROM NASSER .

MOROCCO EXPERIMENTING WITH ELECTIONS ARAB AND AFRICAN LEADERS

GENERALLY SNEER AT HASSAN II OF MOROCCO BECAUSE HE IS A KING IN AN ERA

OF CRUMBLED MONARCHIES . YET SUCH " PROGRESSIVES " AS EGYPT'S NASSER

AND GHANA'S NKRUMAH WOULD NOT DARE TO LET THEIR OWN PEOPLE INDULGE IN

THE MEASURE OF PRESS FREEDOM AND POLITICAL DEMOCRACY THAT HASSAN

ALLOWED IN LAST WEEK'S NATIONAL ELECTIONS . AT STAKE WERE 144 SEATS FOR

A HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, THE FIRST FREELY ELECTED CHAMBER SINCE

MOROCCO WON INDEPENDENCE FROM FRANCE SEVEN YEARS AGO, AND THE FIELD WAS

WIDE OPEN . HASSAN'S MAJOR OPPOSITION PARTIES, THE NATIONALIST ISTIQLAL

AND THE LEFTIST NATIONAL UNION OF POPULAR FORCES, WERE OUT IN STRENGTH,

AND EVEN THE COMMUNIST PARTY OFFICIALLY OUTLAWED BUT QUIETLY TOLERATED

FIELDED THREE CANDIDATES . OPPOSITION NEWSPAPERS CIRCULATED FREELY, AND

ONE PROMINENT POLITICIAN GOT AWAY WITH CALLING THE KING A LIAR . TWO

MONTHS BEFORE THE ELECTION, HASSAN ALSO ENTERED THE RACE BY HAVING HIS

CLOSEST CONFIDANT, INTERIOR-AGRICULTURE MINISTER AHMED REDA GUEDIRA,

40, ORGANIZE A PRO-HASSAN PARTY CHRISTENED THE FRONT FOR THE DEFENSE OF

CONSTITUTIONAL INSTITUTIONS . UNSURPRISINGLY, THE F.D.C.I . ENJOYED THE

USE OF GOVERNMENT VEHICLES TO HAUL WONDERING TRIBESMEN TO RALLIES, PLUS

THE ORGANIZED SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNMENT'S ADMINISTRATIVE BUREAUCRACY .

FLUSH WITH CAMPAIGN CASH, F.D.C.I . LEADER GUEDIRA (WHO GOT SOME

POINTERS WHEN HE WITNESSED THE 1960 U.S . ELECTION CAMPAIGN) PASSED OUT

THOUSANDS OF FREE MINIATURE SOCCER BALLS, T-SHIRTS AND CAMPAIGN BUTTONS

BEARING THE ROYALIST PARTY COLOR (YELLOW) . MORE IMPORTANT FOR HASSAN,

HOWEVER, WAS THE TRADITIONAL APATHY OF MOROCCO'S 75 PER CENT ILLITERATE

POPULATION . IN THE ANCIENT CITY OF FEZ, A HEAVILY VEILED SCRUBWOMAN

CANDIDLY DECLARED, " I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT, BUT I AM GOING

TO VOTE FOR MY KING . " HASSAN'S ROYALISTS EXPECTED TO WIN ENOUGH SEATS

TO ASSURE THE KING OF A PLURALITY . IN ANY CASE, HE DID NOT HAVE TO

WORRY MUCH, FOR THERE WERE LIMITS TO HIS EXPERIMENT IN DEMOCRACY .

UNDER A NEW CONSTITUTION HE PERSONALLY DRAFTED LAST YEAR, HE CAN

DISSOLVE THE HOUSE AT ANY TIME HE CHOOSES .

SAUDI ARABIA THE AILING, FAILING KING IN RECENT MONTHS

62-YEAR-OLD KINGSAUD OF SAUDI ARABIA HAS SUFFERED A SUCCESSION OF

INTESTINAL, STOMACH, CHEST, CIRCULATORY AND HEART AILMENTS . OFTEN THEY

SEEM TO BE AGGRAVATED BY THE SWIRLING POLITICAL EVENTS IN HIS DESERT

CAPITAL OF RIYADH . AFTER THE YEMEN REBELLION LAST FALL THREATENED THE

STABILITY OF HIS THRONE, SAUD'S HEALTH WAS SO UPSET THAT HE TURNED THE

GOVERNMENT OVER TO HIS ABLE BROTHER, PRINCE FEISAL, AND FLEW TO

SWITZERLAND FOR TREATMENT . WHILE SAUD SPENT WEEKS CONVALESCING IN

PARIS AND ON THE RIVIERA, PRINCE FEISAL WAS USING A NEW BROOM AT HOME .

HE FIRED ALL OF SAUD'S SONS AND AIDES WHO HELD GOVERNMENT POSTS, AND

CUT ROYAL FAMILY ALLOWANCES A WHOPPING 20 PER CENT . IN A SERIES OF

SPEECHES, FEISAL TOLD WIDE-EYED CITIZENS : " WITH GOD'S HELP, YOU AND

YOUR GOVERNMENT ARE GOING THE RIGHT WAY . EDUCATION, MEDICAL CARE AND

SOCIAL SECURITY ARE ALL COMPLETELY FREE . " IN ANSWER TO DOLEFUL PLEAS

FROM HIS SONS AND RELATIONS, KING SAUD CAUTIOUSLY RETURNED HOME LAST

MONTH . A FEW TRIBAL DELEGATIONS CAME TO RIYADH TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS .

ONE, LED BY DEPUTY PREMIER PRINCE KHALID, ANOTHER OF SAUD'S 39

BROTHERS, HANDED THE KING AN ULTIMATUM . TACTFULLY BUT PLAINLY, THE

CHIEFTAINS WARNED HIM NOT TO INTERFERE WITH FEISAL OR MAKE ANY ATTEMPT

AGAIN TO WIELD POWER, AT THE RISK OF DETHRONEMENT . THEY ALSO DEMANDED

INSTANT BANISHMENT OF SAUD'S PERSONAL AIDE, EID BEN SALEM, WHO ROSE

FROM PALACE CHAUFFEUR TO ROYAL ENTREPRENEUR AND BECAME VASTLY RICH IN

THE PROCESS . SAUD CAVED IN . ORDERED OUT OF THE COUNTRY, BEN SALEM,

WHO HAS HIS FORTUNE STASHED IN EUROPEAN BANKS, FLEW OFF NONCHALANTLY TO

BEIRUT . FORTY-EIGHT HOURS LATER, SAUD GOT AN EVEN WORSE SHOCK : ONE

OF HIS FAVORITE WIVES, HANDSOME PRINCESS IM MANSOUR, VANISHED FROM THE

PALACE TO JOIN HER LOVER, BEN SALEM, IN EXILE . THE PERSONAL AND

POLITICAL BLOWS COMBINED TO IMPAIR THE REGAL HEALTH ONCE AGAIN . MOSLEM

PILGRIMS TO MECCA WHO WERE BOOKED ON HALF A DOZEN JET FLIGHTS HOME

SUDDENLY FOUND THEIR PASSAGES HAD BEEN CANCELED . INSTEAD, THE

AIRLINERS FLEW TO RIYADH, PICKED UP THE AILING KING AND HIS HUGE

RETINUE, AND CARRIED THEM OFF TO VIENNA . AT WEEK'S END KING SAUD WAS

REPORTEDLY IN AN OXYGEN TENT, RESPONDING TO TREATMENT FOR A DUODENAL

ULCER . DOCTORS PREDICTED RECOVERY WITHIN A FEW WEEKS, BUT RUMORS STILL

FILTERED THROUGH VIENNA THAT SAUD WAS IN FACT QUITE ILL . SHOULD SAUD

DIE, PRINCE FEISAL WILL BECOME KING IN NAME AS WELL AS IN FACT .

CROWDS OF RAGGED CITIZENS STOOD GAPING AS WORKMEN RUSHED TO INSTALL

HUGE PORTRAITS OF PROMINENT AFRICANS ACROSS FROM HAILE SELASSIE'S

PALACE . FINISHING TOUCHES WERE BEING PUT ON A SPANKING NEW HOTEL .

MILE AFTER MILE OF 8-FT.-HIGH CORRUGATED IRON FENCE WAS BEING PUT IN

PLACE ALONG MAIN STREETS TO HIDE THE CITY'S SHABBY SLUMS . ALL THE

EXCITEMENT WAS IN ANTICIPATION OF THIS WEEK'S PAN-AFRICAN " SUMMIT "

CONFERENCE OF SOME 30 AFRICAN HEADS OF STATE . NEVER BEFORE HAD SO MANY

LEADERS OF AFRICA SAT DOWN IN THE SAME PLACE AT THE SAME TIME, AND

THEIR PROUD HOST, THE AGING (70) ETHIOPIAN EMPEROR, WAS OUT AT THE

AIRPORT IN PERSON WITH HIS GREEN-ANDBLACK ROLLS-ROYCE TO GREET MANY OF

HIS ILLUSTRIOUS GUESTS, INCLUDING LIBERIA'S PRESIDENT WILLIAM V .

SHADRACH TUBMAN, WHO ARRIVED FIVE DAYS EARLY SO AS TO SQUEEZE IN A

STATE VISIT . THE GUEST LIST WAS A WHO'S WHO OF AFRICA'S SUCCESSFUL

REVOLUTIONARIES AND MODERATE NATION BUILDERS . GHANA'S EGOCENTRIC

OSAGYEFO (REDEEMER), KWAME NKRUMAH, WAS DUE IN FROM ACCRA . FROM THE

CONGO WOULD COME THE EMBATTLED PREMIER CYRILLE ADOULA . ALSO ON THE

LIST : NIGERIA'S ABLE PRIME MINISTER SIR ABUBAKAR TAFAWA BALEWA ;

SENEGAL'S SENGHOR ; GUINEA'S SEKOU TOURE ; AND DOZENS MORE,

INCLUDING, OF COURSE, THAT AFFABLE FELLOW FROM UP NORTH, EGYPT'S GAMAL

ABDEL NASSER, WHO WAS AN AFRICAN OF A KIND . PREDICTABLY, THERE WERE

THOSE INTERESTED IN BENDING THE CONFERENCE TO THEIR OWN ENDS :.

GHANA'S NKRUMAH SENT A 120-MEMBER DELEGATION PILING INTO ADDIS ABABA

COMPLETE WITH A HIGH-LIFE DANCE BAND . OSAGYEFO WOULD BE PEDDLING HIS

PET SCHEME FOR A BICAMERAL ALL-AFRICA PARLIAMENT AND OTHER SIMILAR

QUICKIE APPROACHES TO A UNITED AFRICA . NO ONE WAS LIKELY TO BUY

NKRUMAH'S SCHEMES, HOWEVER, FOR IT HAS LONG BEEN OBVIOUS TO ALL OF

AFRICA THAT IT IS BASICALLY NKRUMAH THAT NKRUMAH WANTS TO PROMOTE .

APART FROM THAT, REGIONAL DIFFERENCES MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE MOST THAT

CAN BE ACHIEVED IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE IS A LOOSE ASSOCIATION OF

AFRICAN COUNTRIES PATTERNED AFTER THE ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES,

WITH A PERMANENT SECRETARIAT, COUNCIL AND PROGRAM FOR ECONOMIC

COOPERATION . SUCH A GROUPING MIGHT HELP HEAL THE RIFTS AMONG THE

CONTINENT'S CURRENT RIVAL BLOCS CHIEF AMONG THEM THE LEFTLEANING

CASABLANCA GROUP (GHANA, GUINEA, MALI, MOROCCO, ALGERIA, EGYPT), AND

THE MORE MODERATE MONROVIA GROUP, NOW COMPOSED OF NIGERIA, LIBERIA,

FUTURE ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH THE COMMON MARKET, WHICH IS JUST FIVE

YEARS OLD AND IS ALREADY THE WORLD'S BIGGEST TRADING BLOC . AT OTTAWA,

IN RECOGNITION OF ITS ALLIES' NEW STRENGTH, THE U.S . INITIATED THE

SLOW, PAINFUL PROCESS OF SHARING WITH EUROPE CONTROL OF NATO'S NUCLEAR

ARMORY . IF NEITHER CONFERENCE PRODUCED DRAMATIC RESULTS, BOTH NARROWLY

SKIRTED BREAKDOWNS THAT MIGHT HAVE GRAVELY DAMAGED THE ATLANTIC

PARTNERSHIP . NAKED EUROPEANS . DESPITE FRANCE'S AVERSION TO

BIG, EQUAL, ACROSS-THE-BOARD PERCENTAGE CUTS ON HUGE CATEGORIES OF

GOODS . NOTHING DOING, RETORTED THE EUROPEANS, WHO POINTED OUT THAT U.S

. TARIFFS ARE GENERALLY HIGHER THAN EUROPE'S, WHILE THE HIGHEST U.S .

TARIFFS COVER FAR MORE GOODS (20 PER CENT OF ALL U.S . TARIFFS ARE OVER

30 PER CENT V . 1 PER CENT OF EUROPE'S) . THUS, PROTESTED EUROCRATS, IF

EUROPEAN NATIONS CUT THEIR ALREADY LOWER TARIFFS BY THE SAME PERCENTAGE

AS THE U.S., THEY WOULD END UP " NAKED, " WHILE THE U.S . WOULD STILL

BE COMPARATIVELY WELL PROTECTED . IN ANY CASE, SHRUGGED EUROPEANS, THE

U.S . IN 1962 EARNED NEARLY TWICE AS MUCH ($4.4 BILLION) IN THE COMMON

MARKET AS IT BOUGHT FROM THE SIX . SO WHY MAKE THINGS EASIER FOR THE

AMERICANS ? INSIDE THE EGG . THE TALKS ACTUALLY HAD BROKEN DOWN, WHEN

WEST GERMANY'S LUDWIG ERHARD DEVISED THE LAST-DITCH COMPROMISE THAT

PROVED ACCEPTABLE TO JOHN F . KENNEDY . IT CALLS FOR BOTH SIDES TO MAKE

EQUAL, ACROSS-THE-BOARD PERCENTAGE REDUCTIONS, AS PROPOSED BY THE U.S .

THOUGH THEY WILL PROBABLY FALL FAR SHORT OF THE IDEAL 50 PER CENT

ENVISAGED BY WASHINGTON . IN RETURN, THE U.S . AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO

MAKE DRASTIC CUTS IN THE HIGHEST TARIFF CATEGORIES . SINCE THE FINE

PRINT WILL NOT ACTUALLY BE NEGOTIATED UNTIL MAY 1964, SOME U.S . AND

BRITISH OFFICIALS WERE FEARFUL, AS ONE PUT IT, THAT " FRANCE HAS ONLY

MOVED HER ROADBLOCK DOWN THE ROAD . " CONCLUDED ERHARD : " WE ARE

AGREED ON THE SHELL OF AN EGG . WHAT WILL BE IN THE EGG, WE DO NOT KNOW

. " AT OTTAWA EVERYONE KNEW WHAT WAS IN THE EGG, BUT NO ONE KNEW WHAT

TO CALL IT . WELL IN ADVANCE OF LAST WEEK'S SEMIANNUAL NATO COUNCIL

MEETING, THE U.S . AND ITS ALLIES HAD AGREED ON A NEW ADDITION TO

NATO'S ALPHABETICAL ARMORY : IANF, MEANING INTERALLIED NUCLEAR FORCE .

A LIMITED FIRST STEP TOWARD GIVING NATO ITS OWN NUCLEAR DETERRENT, IANF

NOW CONSISTS MAINLY OF 180 BRITISH V-BOMBERS AND THREE

MEDITERRANEAN-BASED U.S . POLARIS SUBMARINES THAT THE TWO NATIONS WILL

TURN OVER TO NATO COMMAND . WHILE IT ALSO INCLUDES 60 FRENCH TACTICAL

BOMBERS, FOR WHICH THE U.S . CONTROLS THE NUCLEAR WARHEADS, THE FRENCH

GOVERNMENT HINTED THAT IT MIGHT WITHDRAW THEM IF IANF WERE MADE TO SEEM

BIGGER AND MORE POWERFUL AS IT IS THAN FRANCE'S VAUNTED FORCE DE FRAPPE

. THUS THE ALLIES AGREED THAT IF FRANCE AGREED NOT TO MAKE ANY SCENES

AT OTTAWA, IANF WOULD BE NAMELESS IT SOON BECAME KNOWN AS THAT THING BY

ANY NAME, THE NEW FORCE IS INTENDED TO GIVE THE NATO ALLIES A GREATER

SENSE OF PARTICIPATION IN NUCLEAR STRATEGY, BUT WILL DO LITTLE TO

INCREASE THEIR ACTUAL ROLE IN THE DEFENSE OF EUROPE . A MORE

SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT, IN THE U.S . VIEW, WOULD BE FORMATION OF A

MULTILATERAL FORCE (MLF), COMPRISING SOME 20 POLARIS-FIRING SURFACE

VESSELS THAT WOULD BE JOINTLY OWNED, CREWED AND PAID FOR BY THE

PARTICIPATING ALLIES . ITS MAIN PURPOSE, OF COURSE, WOULD BE TO

ACCOMMODATE WEST GERMANY'S EAGERNESS FOR A NUCLEAR ROLE COMMENSURATE

CRUSADERS, ARABS AND BRITISH, UP TO THIS YEAR, WHEN THE REGIME OF

IRAQ'S KARIM KASSEM WAS BLED WHITE BY THE EFFORT TO CRUSH ONE MORE

UPRISING OF THE EVER-REBELLIOUS KURD STRIKE . IN BAGHDAD LAST WEEK, THE

NEW IRAQI REGIME THAT DEPOSED AND KILLED KASSEM IN FEBRUARY FINALLY

FACED UP TO THE ISSUE OF PEACE OR CONTINUED WAR WITH THE KURDISH

LEADER, MUSTAFA BARZANI . " THE VERY DAY OF THE REVOLT AGAINST KASSEM,

/ SAID AN ANGRY KURDISH REBEL, " THE NEW IRAQI REVOLUTIONARY COMMAND

CALLED FOR KURDISH SUPPORT . WITH THE REVOLUTION, THE IRAQI ARMED

FORCES WERE TOTALLY DISORGANIZED, AND WE COULD EASILY HAVE STRUCK DEEP

INTO IRAQ . INSTEAD WE ACCEPTED THEIR PROMISES AND HELD OUR FIRE . "

WHAT THE KURDS ARE DEMANDING IS REGIONAL AUTONOMY WITH A KURDISH

LEGISLATURE AND EXECUTIVE COUNCIL, A PROPORTIONATE SHARE FOR KURDS OF

ALL REVENUES, OIL ROYALTIES AND FOREIGN AID AND, FINALLY, SPECIAL

KURDISH ARMY UNITS WITH THE SOLE RIGHT TO GARRISON KURDISTAN . THE

IRAQI GOVERNMENT LAST WEEK STIFFLY REJECTED THE KURDISH MEMORANDUM,

OFFERING THEM INSTEAD ONLY LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT IN A RESTRICTED

MOUNTAIN AREA THAT WOULD HAVE EXCLUDED VIRTUALLY ALL MAJOR KURDISH

POPULATION CENTERS . THREE PLAGUES . THE KURDISH HOMELAND BEGINS ABOVE

BIBLICAL MOUNT ARARAT AND EXTENDS SOUTH IN A LONG, MOUNTAINOUS LOOP TO

THE PERSIAN GULF (SEE MAP) . BECAUSE OF THE ACCIDENTS OF HISTORY AND

THEIR OWN INABILITY TO UNITE, THE ESTIMATED 6,000,000 KURDS ARE TODAY

DIVIDED AMONG FIVE DIFFERENT NATIONS : THE SOVIET UNION, TURKEY,

SYRIA, IRAN AND IRAQ . LIKE THE KURDISH LANDSCAPE, THE KURDISH

CHARACTER HAS REMAINED CONSTANT FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS . MANY KURDS ARE

TALL, FAIR-SKINNED AND BLUE-EYED . OF LIFE THEY ASK LITTLE MORE THAN

FLOCKS OF BROAD-TAILED SHEEP, A FINE HORSE, A RIFLE WITH SUFFICIENT

CARTRIDGE BANDOLEERS, AND A WOMAN WHO CAN BEAR STRONG SONS . FOR

GENERATIONS, THE LOWLAND ARAB HAS BEEN TERRORIZED BY THE MOUNTAIN KURD

. AN ARAB PROVERB SAYS, " THERE ARE THREE PLAGUES IN THE WORLD : THE

RAT, THE LOCUST AND THE KURD . " THE KURDS REPLY, " A CAMEL IS NOT AN

ANIMAL, AND AN ARAB IS NOT A HUMAN BEING . " OF IRAQ'S 7,000,000

PEOPLE, AT LEAST 1,500,000 ARE KURDS . THEY LIVE IN THE FOOTHILLS OF

THE ZAGROS MOUNTAINS, AND ARE DIVIDED INTO 22 MAJOR AND 54 MINOR TRIBES

. UNLIKE THE ARABS ON THE RIVER PLAINS, THEY ARE HARD-WORKING AND FULL

OF BOUNCE . BROAD-SHOULDERED MUSTAFA BARZANI, 60, HAS SPENT MOST OF HIS

ADULT LIFE FIGHTING FOR INDEPENDENCE . AFTER WORLD WAR II, WITH RUSSIAN

BACKING, BARZANI BECAME MILITARY BOSS OF THE SOVIET-INSPIRED KURDISH

PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC IN IRAN AND, WHEN IT COLLAPSED, WAS FOR TWELVE YEARS

IN EXILE IN THE SOVIET UNION . THE YOUNGER BROTHER OF THE RULING SHEIK

OF THE BARZAN TRIBE, BARZANI DENIES HE IS A COMMUNIST, BUT ECHOES OTHER

KURDISH LEADERS WHO SAY THAT IF WAR BREAKS OUT AGAIN THE KURDS WILL "

ACCEPT ALL THE HELP WE CAN GET FROM ANYONE " RUSSIANS INCLUDED . SHOOT

ON SIGHT . AT WEEK'S END, AS THEIR DELEGATES STILL WRANGLED IN BAGHDAD,

BOTH THE KURDISH REBELS AND THE IRAQI ARMY PREPARED FOR THE WORST . THE

GOVERNMENT PROCLAIMED A DUSK-TO-DAWN CURFEW AROUND NORTHERN IRAQ'S

OILFIELDS, PUMP STATIONS, AIRFIELDS, AND MILITARY DEPOTS, WARNED THAT

VIOLATORS WOULD BE " SHOT ON SIGHT . " IRAQI TROOPS BLOCKED ALL ROADS

LEADING INTO THE ZAGROS MOUNTAINS . NEARLY THREE-QUARTERS OF THE ARMY

WAS BUSY BUILDING CONCRETE PILLBOXES AND FORTIFICATIONS COVERING THE

MOUNTAIN PASSES . BUT DURING THE CEASE-FIRE THE KURDS WERE NOT IDLE .

FOOD HAS BEEN STOCKPILED, ARMS REPLENISHED, AND A STANDING ARMY OF

35,000 READIED FOR BATTLE, BACKED BY A RESERVE OF 100,000 . THE REBELS

ARE BUTTRESSED BY SCORES OF KURDISH OFFICERS WHO DESERTED FROM THE

IRAQI ARMY, AND ARE LINKED BY A NETWORK OF 100 CAPTURED FIELD RADIO

SETS . BUT AT WEEK'S END, THE GOVERNMENT CALLED FOR MORE NEGOTIATIONS

AND PROMISED TO RECONSIDER KURDISH DEMANDS . INTURN, THE KURDS AGREED

TO HOLD UP HOSTILITIES . " WE DON'T WANT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR

STARTING THE WAR AGAIN, " SAID A KURDISH SPOKESMAN, " BUT WE AND THE

GOVERNMENT ARE FAR APART LIKE THE DISTANCE FROM GROUND TO SKY . /

EGYPT EVERYONE'S DELIGHTED AS THE TROOPS SWUNG DOWN CAIRO'S

STREETS LAST WEEK, THE CITY GAVE THEM A DELIRIOUS WELCOME . MEN WAVED

GREEN BRANCHES, WOMEN FLUNG FLOWERS FROM BALCONIES, GIRLS BROKE THROUGH

POLICE LINES TO LOOP GARLANDS OVER THE SOLDIERS' NECKS, AND CHILDREN

SCRAMBLED UP TREES AND STATUES . EVERYONE SCREAMED " MARHAB BIL ABTAL

HELICOPTERS DISPLAYED MILITARY FLAGS, AND MIG FIGHTER SQUADRONS

THUNDERED PAST . THE 3,000 TROOPS, THE FIRST VETERANS TO RETURN HOME

FROM THE SEVEN-MONTH CIVIL WAR IN YEMEN, FORMED UP IN REPUBLIC SQUARE,

WHERE PRESIDENT GAMAL ABDEL NASSER MOUNTED THE DAIS, ADVANCED TO A

BATTERY OF MICROPHONES AND CRIED : " O MEN ! FAITHFUL SONS OF YOUR

NATION, IMAGE OF ITS HEROES, VANGUARD OF ITS MARCH TO FREEDOM,

SOCIALISM AND UNITY, YOU HAVE WITNESSED ON YOUR WAY HERE THE DELIGHT OF

YOUR NATION OVER YOUR VICTORIOUS RETURN ! " THE SOLDIERS CLEARLY

SHARED THE NATION'S DELIGHT, FOR EVEN EGYPT'S POVERTYSTRICKEN VILLAGES

WOULD LOOK GOOD AFTER THE HARSH WILDERNESS OF YEMEN . NASSER'S

34-MINUTE SPEECH CONTAINED MENACE AS WELL AS HYPERBOLE . HE GOT DOWN TO

CASES ABOUT HIS INTENTIONS IN YEMEN, WHERE, UP TILL NOW, EACH RETURNING

BATTALION HAS BEEN REPLACED BY AN EQUAL NUMBER OF NEW EGYPTIAN LEVIES .

EGYPTIANS WOULD REMAIN IN YEMEN, HE SAID, " UNTIL IT IS ASCERTAINED

BEYOND ANY SHADOW OF A DOUBT, AND BEYOND DECEPTION, THAT THE

REACTIONARY ELEMENTS HAVE, AS A RESULT OF THEIR DEFEAT, CONTAINED THEIR

RANCOR AGAINST THE REVOLUTION . " HE ALSO SOUNDED A WARNING TO HIS

BAATH PARTY RIVALS IN SYRIA, WHO HAD JUST PURGED THEIR REGIME OF

PRO-NASSER ELEMENTS . BUT HIS WORDS WERE CURIOUSLY MILD . DURING THE

TWELVE DAYS OF NASSER'S TRIP TO ALGERIA AND YUGOSLAVIA, RADIO CAIRO HAD

MADE THE AIR WAVES BLUE WITH ABUSE OF SYRIA'S BAATHIST LEADERS . ON HIS

RETURN, NASSER ABRUPTLY CHOKED OFF THE BROADCAST VITUPERATION . HE GAVE

A PLACE OF HONOR TO A VISITING SYRIAN DELEGATION DURING HIS REPUBLIC

SQUARE SPEECH AND CONFERRED LENGTHILY WITH THE SYRIANS UNTIL THEIR

QUIET RETURN TO DAMASCUS AT MIDWEEK . HE HAD CLEARLY DECIDED THAT THE

MOMENT WAS NOT YET RIPE FOR A SHOWDOWN WITH BAATH LEADERS IN BOTH IRAQ

AND SYRIA, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE PROJECTED TRI-STATE UNITED ARAB

REPUBLIC IS STILL NOT FORMED . BUT THE FIGHT WAS NOT OVER, AND IF THE

PAST WAS ANY GUIDE, IT WOULD NOT BE LONG BEFORE RADIO CAIRO WAS AIMING

CURSES AT THE ARABS WHO STAND IN THE WAY OF GAMAL ABDEL NASSER .

TURKEY'S WEST POINT, COLONEL TALAT AYDEMIR LAST YEAR DECIDED TO TREAT

HIS CADETS TO A SORT OF AFTER-HOURS SEMINAR IN CURRENT EVENTS . HIS

SUBJECT WAS THE SLOW PACE OF GOVERNMENT REFORM UNDER PREMIER ISMET

INONU . TO SPEED THINGS UP, AYDEMIR, 43, A TOUGH EX-ARTILLERY OFFICER,

SUGGESTED THAT THE LADS SUPPORT HIM IN AN ARMED REBELLION AGAINST THE

SHAKY INONU REGIME . BUT EVERYONE FLUNKED THE FINAL EXAM IN

INSURRECTION I AN ABORTIVE COUP LED BY AYDEMIR IN FEBRUARY 1962 THAT

FIZZLED OUT IN SIX HOURS . TEACHER LOST HIS JOB AND HIS UNIFORM, AND

THE CADETS WERE DISCIPLINED . UNDAUNTED, FORMER COLONEL AYDEMIR, SOME

200 OTHER EX-ARMY OFFICERS AND ABOUT 300 CADETS LAST WEEK TRIED

INSURRECTION II ; THEY FLUNKED AGAIN . THE REVOLT BEGAN SHORTLY AFTER

MIDNIGHT WHEN MUTINEERS STORMED THE ANKARA RADIO STATION AND BROADCAST

A DECLARATION THAT THE " REVOLUTIONARY HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMED FORCES

/ WAS TAKING OVER THE COUNTRY . ROUSED FROM THEIR SLEEP, LOYAL ARMY

TROOPS RACED TO THE SCENE, REGAINING CONTROL OF THE MICROPHONES

BRIEFLY, ONLY TO LOSE IT ONCE AGAIN TO THE INSURGENTS . THE CLAIMS AND

COUNTERCLAIMS GOING OUT OVER THE AIR WAVES WERE ALL VERY CONFUSING TO

THE FOLKS TUNED IN AT HOME . IN THE DISTANCE, THEY COULD ALSO HEAR THE

RUMBLE OF TANKS MANNED BY REBEL CADETS, AND THE WHOOSH OF GOVERNMENT

AIR FORCE F-100 JETS THAT WERE SPRAYING THE REBELS WITH MACHINE-GUN

FIRE FROM ROOFTOP LEVEL . WHEN AT LAST IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE

REVOLUTIONARIES WERE CLEARLY OUTGUNNED, AYDEMIR, WHO HAD AGAIN DONNED

HIS COLONEL'S UNIFORM, RACED FOR SAFETY BACK TO THE WAR COLLEGE . AS

GOVERNMENT TROOPS THREATENED TO LEVEL THE BUILDING, HE SNEAKED OUT A

BACK DOOR, LATER WAS CAPTURED IN A FRIEND'S HOME WHILE CHANGING BACK TO

CIVILIAN CLOTHES . THE REVOLT WAS ENDED LESS THAN TWELVE HOURS AFTER IT

STARTED . SEVEN WERE DEAD AND 26 OTHERS WOUNDED, INCLUDING AYDEMIR'S

SUCCESSOR AS COMMANDANT OF OF THE WAR COLLEGE, WHO WAS SHOT IN THE LEG

BY HIS OWN CADETS WHEN HE TRIED TO PERSUADE THEM TO SURRENDER .

ARRESTED ALONG WITH AYDEMIR WERE ABOUT 20 OTHER EX-OFFICERS ACCUSED AS

RINGLEADERS OF THE UPRISING . THEY WILL GO ON TRIAL BEFORE A MILITARY

COURT, AND MOST TURKS DOUBTED THAT THEY WILL LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO TRY

INSURRECTION III .

TERRITORY, AFRICAN LEADERS IN ADDIS ABABA LAST WEEK VOCIFEROUSLY

SUPPORTED ALGERIAN PREMIER AHMED BEN BELLA'S CALL TO " ESTABLISH A BOND

OF BLOOD " WITH THE ANGOLAN NATIONALISTS . THE WAR IS A GRIEVOUS BURDEN

FOR TINY PORTUGAL, WHICH ALREADY HAS WESTERN EUROPE'S LOWEST LIVING

STANDARD . BUT STRONGMAN ANTONIO DE OLIVEIRA SALAZAR, 74, IS BY NOW TOO

DEEPLY COMMITTED TO PRESERVATION OF ANGOLA AS A " PROVINCE " OF

PORTUGAL TO YIELD THE AFRICANS EVEN TOKEN SELF-GOVERNMENT WITHOUT

IMPERILING HIS OWN 31-YEAR REIGN IN LISBON . DESPITE THE STEADY RISE IN

ASSIMILADOS, THE EDUCATED HALF-CASTES WHO HAVE LONG HAD FULL PORTUGUESE

CITIZENSHIP ; TO WIDEN ITS APPEAL, HOWEVER, AN ANGOLAN BLACK, POET

AGOSTINHO NETO, WAS RECENTLY MADE M.P.L.A.'S NOMINAL LEADER . ANDRADE,

WHO, LIKE MOST OF SALAZAR'S FOES, IS OFTEN DENOUNCED AS A COMMUNIST, IS

AN ASTUTE POLITICIAN AND AN ABLE ORGANIZER . HE HAS BUILT A NATIONWIDE

FOLLOWING AMONG THE MULATTO ELITE WHO WOULD BE THE LOGICAL LEADERS OF

INDEPENDENT ANGOLA, AND LAST WEEK IN ADDIS ABABA URGED AFRICA'S

OUT IN 1961 . WITH THE CONGO'S KATANGA PROVINCE NOW UNDER

LEOPOLDVILLE'S CONTROL, THE ANTI-PORTUGUESE REBELS COULD START MOVING

IN THROUGH ANGOLA'S " BACK DOOR " AS WELL . ROBERTO HAS REASON TO BE

CONFIDENT . IT TOOK THE FRENCH FIVE YEARS AND 500,000 TROOPS TO ACHIEVE

EVEN A STALEMATE IN ALGERIA . PORTUGAL IS HARD PRESSED TO FIELD

SMILING SIG WAS HIRED IN 1954 AND SOON MADE HIMSELF A REGULAR MAN

FRIDAY AROUND THE CHANCERY OFFICES ON SOFIISKAYA QUAY . WHEN NO ONE

ELSE COULD GET BOLSHOI BALLET TICKETS, SIG DID . HE WAS EQUALLY

SKILLFUL AT PRODUCING HARD-TO-GET GOODIES, OR BLACK-MARKETING THEIR

CLOTHES OR WESTERN CURRENCY FOR A HANDSOME PROFIT . HE ALWAYS WENT OUT

OF HIS WAY TO HELP THE LONELY ONES, SHOWED THEM THE SIGHTS, EVEN TOOK

THEM TO RESTAURANTS WHERE THEY INVARIABLY MET RUSSIANS WHO SEEMED NOT

AT ALL AFRAID TO TALK FREELY WITH WESTERNERS . OLDER EMBASSY HANDS WERE

SKEPTICAL ABOUT SIG, KNOWING THAT HE WAS PROBABLY A SOVIET SPY . AFTER

ALL, LOCAL HELP IN MOSCOW MUST BE HIRED FROM U.P.D.K., THE GOVERNMENT

PERSONNEL AGENCY FOR FOREIGN EMPLOYERS OF THE EMBASSY FIRED SIG, THEY

REASONED, HE WOULD PROBABLY ONLY BE REPLACED BY ANOTHER SPY WHO MIGHT

BE A BOUNDER TO BOOT . IN ANY CASE, THE YOUNGER BRITONS, WHO INVITED

HIM TO THEIR PARTIES AND WENT TO HIS, KNEW THAT ALL HIS FRIENDS WERE

ATTACHED TO WESTERN EMBASSIES, AND FELT CERTAIN THAT HE HATED THE

RUSSIANS . " YOU SEE, " EXPLAINED SIG, " I'M A POLE . " HE MADE A

DETERMINED PASS AT EVERY NEW ENGLISH GIRL HE MET AND AT THE BOYS AS

WELL . WHEN THEY RESISTED, HE EXPLAINED MOURNFULLY THAT LIFE IN MOSCOW

WAS HARD ON A PASSIONATE POLE . UNUSUAL HAPPENINGS . ALAS, POOR SIG !

ONE DAY IN 1956, AFTER NEARLY FIVE YEARS AT THE EMBASSY, THE BRITISH

SUDDENLY FIRED HIM . NOT WITHOUT CAUSE . SIG'S SAGA FINALLY CAME TO

THAT HAS SPENT THREE MONTHS INVESTIGATING THE LATEST BRITISH SPY

SCANDAL : THE STRANGE CASE OF WILLIAM JOHN VASSALL, A HOMOSEXUAL

ADMIRALTY CLERK WHO HAD BEEN ASSIGNED TO THE MOSCOW EMBASSY FOR TWO

YEARS, AND HAD BEEN SPYING FOR THE RUSSIANS FOR SEVEN . VASSALL'S

SUPERIORS, AND ALL BUT ONE OF THE OFFICERS WHO PICKED HIM OUT OF 40

APPLICANTS FOR THE MOSCOW ASSIGNMENT, WERE EXONERATED BY THE TRIBUNAL,

WHICH JUDGED HIM " WEAK " BUT NOT OVERTLY QUEER . HOWEVER, ADMITTED THE

REPORT, VASSALL'S YOUNG COLLEAGUES IN THE MOSCOW EMBASSY RIDICULED HIS

/ EFFEMINATE " WAYS AND CALLED HIM " VERA . " THE PASSIONATE POLE SOON

GUESSED HIS SECRET, AND LIFE BEGAN ANEW FOR VERA VASSALL . EAGER TO

SHARE HIS NEW CONQUEST, SIG INTRODUCED VASSALL TO OTHER GAY TYPES . " I

SHALL NEVER FORGET, " VASSALL WROTE TO AN OLDER MAN IN LONDON, " THE

MANY UNUSUAL AND EXTRAORDINARY HAPPENINGS THAT GO ON HERE, WHICH MUST

COME TO FEW PEOPLE . " HE DID NOT APPARENTLY REGARD IT AS TOO UNUSUAL

WHEN ONE OF HIS NEW RUSSIAN FRIENDS PHOTOGRAPHED HIM IN THE ACT ONE

EVENING . IT WAS NOT UNTIL VASSALL WAS CAUGHT REDHANDED WITH A SOVIET

OFFICER THAT RUSSIAN SECRET POLICE INTERVENED AND EXPLAINED TO HIM THE

GRAVITY OF HIS OFFENSE . WHEN THEY THREATENED TO SHOW THE COMPROMISING

PHOTOGRAPHS TO LADY HAYTER, WIFE OF THE AMBASSADOR, VASSALL AGREED TO

PROVIDE THEM WITH THE CLASSIFIED EMBASSY DOCUMENTS THEY WANTED .

MANUFACTURED COMPROMISE . DURING HIS YEARS AT THE BRITISH EMBASSY, SAID

THE TRIBUNAL'S REPORT, SIG TRIED TO BLACKMAIL THREE OTHER BRITONS FOR

BLACK-MARKETING, GOT AT LEAST TWO MEMBERS OF OTHER WESTERN EMBASSIES

INVOLVED IN HOMOSEXUAL ACTIVITIES ; ALL THESE VICTIMS WERE HUSTLED

HOME BY THEIR GOVERNMENTS AFTER REFUSING TO SPY FOR HIM . SIG ALSO

TRIED HIS BEST TO SEDUCE A FEMALE SECRETARY IN THE BRITISH EMBASSY, BUT

SHE GUESSED HIS AIM AND REPORTED HIM . STILL SIG STAYED ON . " THE

MANUFACTURE OF COMPROMISING SITUATIONS, " CONCLUDED THE JUDGES' REPORT

LAST WEEK, " MUST BE REGARDED AS ONE OF THE REGULAR INSTRUMENTS BY

WHICH THE SOVIET SECRET SERVICE SEEKS TO SUBORN AND ENLIST BRITISH

AGENTS WHO CAN FURNISH IT WITH OUR STATE SECRETS . " THUS WAS BRITAIN'S

BRIGHT, ABLE AND RUTHLESS LABOR LEADER WHO LEADS A MODERATE FACTION

JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS, AND ODINGA WAS GIVEN THE

POTENTIALLY POWERFUL HOME AFFAIRS MINISTRY . AGAINST ALL PREDICTIONS,

KENYATTA NAMED NO ONE AT ALL AS VICE PREMIER . NO CONGO . KENYATTA HAS

MELLOWED WITH AGE, IMPRISONMENT, AND REPEATED MARRIAGES (HE HAS HAD

FOUR WIVES, THREE OF WHOM SURVIVE, AS DO SEVEN CHILDREN AND FOUR

KENYATTA'S MODERATE WORDS, BRITAIN'S MACDONALD DISCLOSED THAT ALL THREE

GRATEFUL FOR THE ARMS ORDER THAT IT INVITED STRAUSS DOWN FOR A VISIT .

DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BETWEEN WEST GERMANY AND ISRAEL, AND TO TRY TO BAR

WEST GERMAN SCIENTISTS FROM WORKING FOR ISRAEL'S ARCHENEMY, EGYPT .

BUILT WITH ONLY A TOKEN CONTRIBUTION FROM BRITAIN . HOWEVER, WHEN ALDO

SOUTH VIET NAM THE MAKESHIFT KILLERS INTO THE

VALLEY OF DEATH LAST WEEK FLEW THE 800 . THEY WERE SOUTH VIETNAMESE

TROOPS BEING LIFTED BY A COMPANY OF U.S . H-21 TROOP-CARRYING

HELICOPTERS TO CLEAN OUT A COMMUNIST-INFESTED JUNGLE HIDEOUT 175 MILES

NORTHEAST OF SAIGON . THE REGION WAS A TANGLED, MENACING BATTLEGROUND,

WHOSE NAME, LIKE TENNYSON'S BALACLAVA, DERIVES FROM ITS BLOODY HISTORY

IN SOUTH VIET NAM'S UGLY GUERRILLA WAR . AS EACH FLIGHT DIPPED INTO THE

TINY LANDING ZONE, AN ESCORT OF TWELVE ROCKETCARRYING UH 1-B ( " HUEY "

) CHOPPERS SPRAYED THE SCRUBBY UNDERBRUSH WITH ROCKETS AND MACHINE-GUN

FIRE . NOT A SINGLE HOSTILE SHOT WAS RETURNED AS THE TROOPS HIT THE

GROUND AND FANNED INTO THE JUNGLE . THE ABSENCE OF ENEMY OPPOSITION IN

THE LANDING AREA COULD BE LARGELY TRACED TO VIET CONG FEAR OF THE

ROCKET-CARRYING HUEYS . BEFORE THEIR ARRIVAL IN SOUTH VIET NAM LAST

FALL, DEVASTATING COMMUNIST GROUND FIRE AGAINST THE LUMBERING,

DEFENSELESS H-21S THREATENED TO HALT THE GOVERNMENT'S HELICOPTER

AIRLIFT CAMPAIGN, WHICH HAD BEEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE OFFENSIVE TACTIC

AGAINST THE RED GUERRILLAS . RELUCTANTLY THE TOP U.S . MILITARY BRASS,

WHICH HAD LONG BEEN SKEPTICAL THAT A HELICOPTER COULD EVER BE A DEADLY

OFFENSIVE WEAPON, THREW THE NEWLYARRIVED HUEYS INTO COMBAT . THEIR

MISSION : TO ESCORT AND PROTECT THE TROOPCARRYING COPTERS . " THE MOST

ESSENTIAL UNIT . " SO EFFECTIVE HAVE THE HUEYS BEEN IN COUNTERACTING

VIET CONG GROUND FIRE THAT SOME H-21 PILOTS HAVE REFUSED TO CARRY OUT

MISSIONS RATHER THAN FLY WITHOUT HUEY ESCORTS . SINCE LAST OCTOBER, THE

HUEYS HAVE FLOWN 3,600 SORTIES, FIRED 1,800 ROCKETS AND 200,000 ROUNDS

OF MACHINEGUN AMMUNITION, AND KILLED COUNTLESS HUNDREDS OF REDS . TWO

ENLISTED MEN OF THE COMPANY (WHOSE OFFICIAL MILITARY DESIGNATION IS

UTILITY TACTICAL TRANSPORT COMPANY) HAVE BEEN KILLED IN COMBAT, AND 19

OTHER MEMBERS OF THE 113-MAN UNIT HAVE BEEN AWARDED THE DISTINGUISHED

FLYING CROSS . TODAY U.S . MILITARY OFFICIALS ESTIMATE THAT, ALTHOUGH

THE VIET CONG HAS DOUBLED ITS ANTIAIRCRAFT EFFORT IN THE PAST YEAR, THE

TROOP-CARRYING CHOPPERS ARE SUFFERING 25 PER CENT FEWER HITS THAN

BEFORE THE HUEYS ARRIVED ON THE VIET NAM SCENE . " THE HUEYS, " SAYS

GENERAL PAUL HARKINS, THE CAPABLE BOSS OF THE 14,000 U.S . ADVISERS IN

SOUTH VIET NAM, " ARE THE MOST ESSENTIAL UNIT IN MY COMMAND . " THE

IRONY OF THE HUEYS' SUCCESS IS THAT THEY ARE MAKESHIFT KILLERS,

ORIGINALLY DESIGNED AS UTILITY AIRCRAFT AND PERSONNEL CARRIERS . BUT

HUEY PILOTS BECAME CONVINCED THAT THEIR SPEEDY, MANEUVERABLE CHOPPERS

WOULD BE IDEAL SUPPORT AIRCRAFT IN THE KIND OF GUERRILLA WAR SITUATION

THAT SOUTHEAST ASIA PRESENTS . ON THEIR OWN, COMPANY PERSONNEL

OUTFITTED THEIR HUEYS WITH 16 HOMEMADE ROCKET MOUNTS AND FOUR

MACHINE-GUN BRACKETS, PESTERED DUBIOUS BRASS FOR MONTHS TO LET THEM TRY

OUT THEIR IDEAS IN ACTION . THE HUEYS' EFFECTIVENESS IS MAINLY THE

RESULT OF THEIR ABILITY TO CHUG RIGHT ALONG IN THE SAME FORMATION WITH

THE H-21S . UNLIKE FIXED-WING FIGHTER BOMBERS, WHICH FLY TOO HIGH AND

TOO FAST TO PICK OUT SPECIFIC TARGETS AND SOMETIMES DROP NAPALM ON

INNOCENT CIVILIANS, THE SLOWCRUISING HUEYS CAN SPOT GROUND FIRE IN THE

LANDING ZONE AND MOVE IN TO NEUTRALIZE IT WITH DISCRIMINATING FIRE THAT

SPARES NONCOMBATANTS . " IF WE KILL ONE WOMAN OR A CHILD ON A MISSION

AND 90 VIET CONG, " SAYS ONE HUEY PILOT, " THEN THAT MISSION IS A

FAILURE . " PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT . AS A PREVIOUSLY UNTRIED COMBAT

INNOVATION, THE HUEYS CAN AFFORD TO EXPERIMENT IN HELIBORNE ASSAULT

TACTICS, ARE PROVIDING THE ARMY WITH INVALUABLE OPERATIONAL EXPERIENCE

IN NEW DOCTRINES OF GUERRILLA WARFARE . " WE'RE WRITING THE BOOK OF

TACTICS OURSELVES, " SAYS MAJOR IVAN SLAVICH, 35, COMMANDING OFFICER OF

THE U.T.T . COMPANY . IN COMBAT, THE HUEYS USUALLY FLY A CIRCULAR "

DAISY CHAIN " PATTERN SO THAT EACH SHIP IS ALWAYS COVERED BY THE

CHOPPER IMMEDIATELY BEHIND IT . " OUR MACHINE GUNS HAVE MORE ACTUAL

KILLING POWER, " SAYS SLAVICH . " BUT OUR ROCKETS SEEM TO HAVE A MUCH

GREATER PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT ON THE VIET CONG . /

THE MAKESHIFT KILLERS WITH THEIR MANEUVERABILITY, THE HUEYS

CAN SLIDE BACK AND FORTH JUST A FEW FEET OVER THE SUN-SCORCHED RICE

FIELDS, SORTING OUT THEIR TARGETS LIKE COWBOYS CUTTING STEERS FROM A

HERD . ON ONE RECENT MISSION, THE DESPERATE REDS TRIED TO LOB HAND

GRENADES INTO THE OPEN SIDE DOORS OF THE LOW-CIRCLING CHOPPERS . WHEN

TWO HUEYS TRIED TO BOX IN AND CAPTURE A FLEEING RED GUERRILLA, HE

SUDDENLY WHEELED AND HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THEM, A HAND GRENADE IN EACH

HAND . A BURST OF GUNFIRE FROM THE CHOPPERS CUT HIM DOWN ; BOTH

GRENADES EXPLODED BENEATH HIS BODY . FROM THE DOOR OF A GRASS HUT, A

GUERRILLA BLAZED AWAY AT A HOVERING HUEY, MISSED ITS COPILOT BY ONLY A

FEW INCHES . THE HUEY'S WINGMAN PLANTED A ROCKET SMACK IN THE DOORWAY

OF THE HUT AND BLEW IT TO PIECES . SCARED PRINCESS . THE CHOPPER PILOTS

CREDIT SLAVICH FOR THE OUTSTANDING SUCCESS OF THE HUEYS, CALL THEIR

OUTFIT " SLAVICH'S PEOPLE . " SON OF A RETIRED SAN FRANCISCO DEMOCRATIC

WARD POLITICIAN, SLAVICH SERVED AS A MARINE CORPS ENLISTED MAN AFTER

WORLD WAR II, BECAME AN ARMY OFFICER AFTER GRADUATION FROM THE

UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO IN 1951 . HE WON A COMBAT INFANTRYMAN'S

BADGE IN KOREA, BECAME A PILOT IN 1955, TOOK COMMAND OF THE U.T.T .

COMPANY LAST NOVEMBER . SLAVICH RUNS AN EASYGOING OUTFIT AT HIS BASE AT

THE EDGE OF SAIGON AIRPORT . LIKE TOURISTS, SOME PILOTS TOTE CAMERAS ON

MISSIONS, AND SLAVICH HIMSELF USED TO TAKE HIS GERMAN SHEPHERD,

PRINCESS, ALONG ON SORTIES UNTIL THE PUP BECAME SO SHELL-SHY THAT SHE

NEARLY JUMPED OUT OF THE CHOPPER WHEN THE ROCKETS WERE FIRED . THE

PILOTS HAVE A JARGON OF THEIR OWN . THEY " ZAP " THE VIET CONG ON A

GOOD DAY, CALL SAIGON " THE VILLE, " EXPRESS FERVENT APPROVAL OF

EVERYTHING FROM A GIRL TO A CHOPPER WITH THE WORD " OUTSTANDIN' . "

TOP-RANKING VISITORS OFTEN HITCH RIDES ON THEIR FLIGHTS TO GET IN A FEW

PERSONAL LICKS AT THE VIET CONG . BRIGADIER GENERAL JOSEPH STILWELL

JR., SON OF " VINEGAR JOE, " FREQUENTLY RIDES SHOTGUN IN SLAVICH'S OWN

CHOPPER . ONCE, WITH STILWELL ABOARD, SLAVICH HAD TO MAKE AN EMERGENCY

LANDING IN A RED-INFESTED AREA . " I WAS SCARED TO DEATH, " SAID

SLAVICH . GLAD THE VIET CONG DIDN'T COME ALONG, BECAUSE I KNOW DAMN

WELL THAT GENERAL STILWELL WOULD HAVE MADE US FIGHT FOR THE MACHINE

INSTEAD OF LETTING US RUN . " / PUCKER UP & PRAY . " DEADLY AS THE

HUEYS ARE, THEY HAVE THEIR FAULTS . AS BOTH DOORS MUST BE KEPT WIDE

OPEN TO GIVE THE AUTOMATIC RIFLE-TOTING SIDE GUNNERS COMPLETE

VISIBILITY, THE BLAST OF THE ROCKETS CREATES AN EAR-SHATTERING DIN IN

THE COPTER'S CABIN . EVEN WORSE, THE HUEYS ARE VIRTUALLY UNARMORED, AND

ENEMY FLAK CUTS THROUGH THEM EASILY . ALL FOUR CREWMEN NOT ONLY WEAR

FLAK VESTS BUT ALSO SIT ON A PILE OF VESTS TO PROTECT PRIVATE PARTS . "

WHEN AN ENEMY IS SHOOTING AT YOU AT THAT LOW ALTITUDE, IT'S THE MOST

HOPELESS FEELING IN THE WORLD, " SAYS ONE PILOT . " THERE'S NOTHING TO

DO BUT PUCKER UP AND PRAY . " BUT BECAUSE OF THE HUEYS' PERFORMANCE,

THE ARMY IS NOW ENCOURAGING THE DESIGN OF A MUCH BETTER, ARMORED,

ATTACK HELICOPTER, WHICH MIGHT ACHIEVE SPEEDS OF 175 KNOTS AND EMPLOY

HEAVIER MACHINE GUNS AND PERMANENTLY INSTALLED TURRETS FOR THE LETHAL

ROCKETS . FROM MAJOR SLAVICH COMES THE RATIONALE FOR SUCH AN AIRCRAFT .

/ WE CAN STAY IN THE SAME ENVIRONMENT AS THE HELICOPTERS WE ARE

PROTECTING, " HE SAID . " WE CAN WORK IN CLOSE, WE CAN WORK IN

UNLIMITED VISIBILITY, WE CAN VARY OUR AIRSPEED FROM 100 KNOTS TO ZERO .

WE CAN SEEK AND FIND A HOSTILE MENACE TO HELICOPTERS BETTER THAN ANYONE

ELSE . /

GREAT BRITAIN THE PRICE OF CHRISTINE WHAT THE HELL IS

GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY ? SHOUTED THE DAILY MIRROR . AS IF ANYONE

DIDN'T KNOW . WHAT WENT ON WAS JUST THE KIND OF STORY ON WHICH THE

MIRROR THRIVES . ALTHOUGH IT HAD STARTED OUT

MERELY AS VENERY IN HIGH (AND

SEVERAL LOW) PLACES, IT GREW INTO A MAJOR SCANDAL THAT NOT ONLY SMASHED

THE CAREER OF A PROMISING TORY POLITICIAN, BUT ALSO RAISED SOME

TROUBLING QUESTIONS ABOUT BRITISH SECURITY AND ROCKED THE MACMILLAN

GOVERNMENT . OTHERWISE, IT READ LIKE LA DOLCE VITA, ANGLO-SAXON STYLE .

THE STORY FIRST EMERGED PARTIALLY LAST MARCH, WHEN ITS LEADING

CHARACTERS BECAME PUBLICLY IDENTIFIED : RED-HAIRED CHRISTINE KEELER,

WHO CAME FROM MIDDLESEX TO SLING HASH AT 17, AND AT 21 WAS THE WEST

END'S MOST-CALLED GIRL ; JOHN PROFUMO, 48, THE ABLE WAR MINISTER AND

MAN-ABOUT-MAYFAIR, WHOSE VIRILE CHARM PROVED SOMETHING OF A TORY ASSET

AFTER THOSE HOMOSEXUAL SPY SCANDALS ,; AND DR . STEPHEN WARD, 43, A

SOCIAL OSTEOPATH (AND SON OF THE ANGLICAN CANON OF ROCHESTER

CATHEDRAL), WHO SAID HE LIKED HELPING ATTRACTIVE GIRLS OF HUMBLE BIRTH

ADAPT TO " THE NEEDS AND STRESSES OF MODERN LIVING . " AFTER MONTHS OF

RUMOR, A LABOR M.P . CHALLENGED THE GOVERNMENT TO DENY THE RUMORS OF A

MINISTER'S INDISCRETIONS WITH CHRISTINE . PROFUMO'S FIRM DENIAL OF

WRONGDOING, AND A DEMONSTRATION OF SUPPORT FROM PRIME MINISTER

MACMILLAN, QUASHED THE STORY TEMPORARILY UNTIL IT BURST FORTH AGAIN

LAST WEEK . THIS TIME PROFUMO RESIGNED FROM THE GOVERNMENT AFTER AN

ABRUPT, ABJECT CONFESSION THAT HE HAD PREVIOUSLY LIED TO THE PRIME

MINISTER, HIS COLLEAGUES AND THE HOUSE OF COMMONS . COEXISTENCE . OF

NOBLE ITALIAN DESCENT, JOHN DENNIS PROFUMO HAD EVERY QUALIFICATION TO

REACH THE TORIES' TOP RANKS : HARROW AND OXFORD, FINE WAR RECORD,

BRAINS, DRIVE, AND A BEAUTIFUL WIFE, MOVIE ACTRESS VALERIE (GREAT

EXPECTATIONS) HOBSON . TOGETHER, THE PROFUMOS WERE WEEKENDING AT

CLIVEDEN, FAMED COUNTRY ESTATE OF LORD AND LADY ASTOR, WHEN THEY WERE

INTRODUCED TO CHRISTINE IN 1961 . ALSO PRESENT : STEPHEN WARD, WHO HAD

A COTTAGE ON THE PLACE . THEREAFTER, VALERIE STAYED HOME WHILE JACK

VISITED CHRISTINE AT WARD'S FLAT IN WIMPOLE MEWS . WHAT THE WAR

MINISTER NEVER KNEW WAS THAT CHRISTINE HAD ANOTHER REGULAR VISITOR,

EVGENY IVANOV, WHO WAS A SOVIET NAVAL ATTACHE IN LONDON . A ROUND-EYED

OBSERVER OF THEIR COEXISTENCE WAS NYMPHET MARILYN ( " MANDY " )

RICE-DAVIES, A WELL-DEVELOPED 16-YEAR-OLD, WHO WAS ONE OF CHRISTINE'S

INTIMATES . " THE FARCICAL THING ABOUT IT ALL, " AS MANDY TOLD THE

PRESS, " WAS THAT, ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION, AS JACK LEFT CHRISTINE AT

THE FLAT, IVANOV WALKED IN . " IT POSSIBLY SEEMED LESS HILARIOUS TO

BRITISH MI-5 INTELLIGENCE AGENTS, WHO WERE SHADOWING IVANOV AT THE

TIME, TO FIND THAT THEIR WAR MINISTER WAS UNWITTINGLY SHARING A BED

WITH A SUSPECTED SOVIET SPY .

THE PRICE OF CHRISTINE THOUGH THEY TRIED NOT TO BE SEEN IN

PUBLIC, PROFUMO SOMETIMES TOOK CHRISTINE FOR DRIVES, SHE LATER RECALLED

. " HE SHOWED ME THE WAR OFFICE, WHERE HE WORKED . HE EVEN SHOWED ME

DOWNING STREET . " BUT IN TIME PROFUMO STOPPED SEEING CHRISTINE

BECAUSE, SHE EXPLAINED, HE WAS " SCARED IT WOULD RUIN HIS CAREER . "

COMRADE IVANOV WAS SHIPPED OFF TO MOSCOW, AND THE " MODEL " FROM

MIDDLESEX, WHO HAD ACQUIRED A TASTE FOR JAZZ ON THE WAY UP, HIT THE

BLUES BELT AND ACQUIRED A JAMAICAN LOVER NAMED JOHNNIE EDGECOMBE . BUT

HE COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND WHAT HER TELEPHONE WAS FOR . " HE SEEMED TO

THINK, " CHRISTINE COMPLAINED LATER, " THAT I WAS GOING TO LIVE WITH

HIM FOREVER . " ONE DAY, JOHNNIE SHOWED UP WITH A GUN AND FIRED SEVERAL

BULLETS INTO THE DOOR BEFORE THE BOBBIES BAGGED HIM . MULTIRACIALISM .

AFTER JOHNNIE WENT TO JAIL, THERE WAS ANOTHER WEST INDIAN LOVER,

ALOYSIUS " LUCKY " GORDON, WHO, IF ANYTHING, WAS EVEN MORE NARROWMINDED

. IN APRIL HE BEAT HER UP . LAST WEEK, AT HIS TRIAL FOR ASSAULT,

ALOYSIUS WAS SO UNGALLANT AS TO TESTIFY THAT HE HAD KEPT HER SUPPLIED

WITH MARIJUANA, WHILE ALL SHE GAVE HIM IN RETURN WAS VD . " YOU CAN SAY

THIS FOR CHRISTINE, " SAID A LEADING LABOR POLITICIAN . " AT LEAST

SHE'S MULTIRACIAL . " THE SCANDAL MIGHT HAVE DIED, HAD IT NOT BEEN

RESURRECTED BY STEPHEN WARD HIMSELF . SEVEN WEEKS AFTER PROFUMO'S

DENIAL, HE TOLD THE PRIME MINISTER'S PRIVATE SECRETARY THAT THE WAR

MINISTER HAD LIED IN COMMONS, THAT HE HAD INDEED HAD AN AFFAIR WITH

CHRISTINE KEELER . WARD REPEATED HIS CHARGES IN LETTERS TO HOME

SECRETARY HENRY BROOKE AND LABOR PARTY LEADER HAROLD WILSON . PROFUMO

WAS CONFRONTED WITH THIS NEW ACCUSATION, BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL LAST WEEK

THAT HE STARTLED TORY OFFICIALS BY BLURTING THE TRUTH ABOUT CHRISTINE

IN A LETTER TO THE VACATIONING PRIME MINISTER, PROFUMO RESIGNED AS

WAR MINISTER AND AS M.P . FOR STRATFORD-ON-AVON, CONFESSING HIS " GRAVE

MISDEMEANOR . " SAID HE : " I CANNOT TELL YOU OF MY DEEP REMORSE . "

MACMILLAN ACCEPTED HIS RESIGNATION, DESCRIBING THE AFFAIR AS " A GREAT

TRAGEDY . " THEN PROFUMO AND HIS WIFE LEFT THEIR REGENT'S PARK HOME AND

DISAPPEARED INTO THE COUNTRY . DILEMMA . THE SCANDAL HE LEFT BEHIND GOT

LIVELIER EVERY DAY . CHRISTINE KEELER, WHO WAS BACK FROM A CONTINENTAL

HOLIDAY AND SUDDENLY SPORTED A " BUSINESS MANAGER " AND A NEW

ROLLS-ROYCE, ADDED MORE OFF-COLOR TO THE SAGA BY TELLING AND SELLING

HER STORY TO THE PAPERS . " I WAS VERY FOND OF JACK, " SHE SAID

WISTFULLY . " IF EVER WE MEET AGAIN, WE HAVE AT LEAST THIS IN COMMON

BOTH OUR CAREERS HAVE BEEN RUINED . " MANDY CHIMED IN WITH DETAILS OF

THE HIGH LIVING THAT HAD EARNED HER A JAGUAR, MINK AND DIAMONDS BY HER

17TH BIRTHDAY . AT ONE DINNER PARTY, SHE RECALLED, " A NAKED MAN

WEARING A MASK WAITED ON TABLE LIKE A SLAVE . HE HAD TO HAVE A MASK

BECAUSE HE WAS SO WELL KNOWN . /

MEANWHILE STEPHEN WARD'S EXPLANATIONS FILLED THE NEWSPAPERS AND TV

SCREENS . THE AFFAIR, HE PROTESTED, HAD GIVEN RISE TO " A WHOLE TRAIN

OF RUMORS, AND ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE WERE MENTIONED, WITH THE IMPLICATION

THAT I'D BEEN TRYING TO PROCURE THEM FOR MISS KEELER . " DESPITE HIS

SUBSEQUENT ATTEMPT TO PROTECT PROFUMO AND THE GOVERNMENT, SAID WARD, HE

HAD REPORTED PROFUMO'S LIAISON TO BRITISH INTELLIGENCE WHEN IT WAS AT

ITS HEIGHT IN 1961 . SAID HE : " I'VE ALMOST HAD A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN .

IT'S A TERRIBLE DILEMMA . ONE DIDN'T WANT TO BITCH UP ANYBODY . YOU OWE

IT TO YOUR FRIENDS . BUT I MUST CLEAR MYSELF . " FOR THE IMMEDIATE

FUTURE, STEPHEN WARD WILL DO HIS EXPLAINING IN COURT . AT WEEK'S END

SCOTLAND YARD PLUCKED THE OSTEOPATH FROM HIS WHITE JAGUAR SPORTS CAR

AND JAILED HIM ON CHARGES OF VIOLATING BRITAIN'S SEXUAL OFFENSES ACT BY

/ LIVING WHOLLY OR IN PART ON THE EARNINGS OF PROSTITUTION . " UNREST .

AS A MATTER OF POLITICAL TACTICS, THE LABOR PARTY DECIDED TO TREAT THE

PROFUMO AFFAIR NOT SO MUCH AS A MORAL INDICTMENT OF UPPERCRUST BRITAIN

BUT RATHER AS ANOTHER FLAGRANT EXAMPLE OF THE ERRATIC WORKINGS OF

BRITAIN'S SECURITY SYSTEM . IF, ARGUED LABORITES, BRITISH INTELLIGENCE

HAD KNOWN ALL ALONG THAT BRITAIN'S WAR MINISTER HAD SHARED A CALL GIRL

WITH A SOVIET AGENT, WHY WAS NOTHING DONE TO BREAK UP A LIAISON THAT

MIGHT EXPOSE HIM TO RUSSIAN BLACKMAIL ? WAS MACMILLAN TOLD ? IF SO,

HAD THE GOVERNMENT ENCOURAGED PROFUMO TO LIE ABOUT HIS DALLIANCE WITH

CHRISTINE KEELER SOLELY IN ORDER TO AVERT A DAMAGING SCANDAL ?

UNFLAPPABLE HAROLD MACMILLAN, WHO DID NOT ALLOW LAST WEEK'S EVENTS TO

INTERRUPT HIS GOLFING VACATION, WILL BE ABLE TO PRESENT THE

GOVERNMENT'S CASE WHEN PARLIAMENT RECONVENES NEXT WEEK . HE MAY YET, AS

IN THE PAST, CONFOUND HIS CRITICS IN COMMONS . BUT THE AFFAIR MAY

SERIOUSLY AFFECT THE TORIES' ALREADY SHAKY CHANCES AT THE NEXT

ELECTIONS, WHICH MACMILLAN WILL NOW PROBABLY TRY TO DELAY . SAID TORY

BACKBENCHER LORD LAMBTON : " THE HARM THIS WILL DO TO THE CONSERVATIVE

PARTY WILL BE ENORMOUS . THERE HAS BEEN FOR SOME TIME A GENERAL FEELING

OF UNREST IN THIS COUNTRY AS TO THE MORALITY OF THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT

. THIS FEELING WILL BE IMMENSELY INCREASED . /

THE ALLIES THREE ON A HORSE TOP BRITISH DEFENSE OFFICIALS

LISTENED POLITELY IN LONDON LAST WEEK WHILE A U.S . NAVY TASK FORCE

ARGUED THE MERITS OF A MISSILE-FIRING SURFACE FLEET MANNED BY MIXED

NATO CREWS . THE BRITONS' REAL FEELINGS TOWARD THE MULTILATERAL FORCE

(MLF) WERE BEST EXPRESSED IN A SARDONIC LIMERICK THAT MADE THE ROUNDS

OF WHITEHALL : HOORAY FOR THE MULTIMIXED FORCE, GERMAN, BRITISH AND

YANKEE, OF COURSE ! EACH PRODUCES A KNIGHT, AND THE PLAN IS TO FIGHT

OR DETER WITH ALL THREE ON ONE HORSE . BEHIND U.S . EFFORTS TO SELL MLF

WAS THE ILL-CONCEALED FACT THAT MILITARY WASHINGTON DOES NOT REALLY

BELIEVE IN IT EITHER . PRIVATELY THE PENTAGON CONSIDERS IT AT BEST A

GIMMICK TO POSTPONE " PROLIFERATION " OF INDEPENDENT NUCLEAR FORCES TO

OTHER NATIONS, WHICH IT WANTS AT ALL COSTS TO PREVENT OR DELAY . "

MONSTROUS NONSENSE . " CHARGED WITH THE HALFHEARTED MISSION OF WINNING

BRITISH SUPPORT FOR THE $5 BILLION MLF WAS ADMIRAL CLAUDE RICKETTS, U.S

. DEPUTY CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS, WHO HAS DOUBLED OF LATE AS THE

PENTAGON'S MULTIMIXMASTER . STRATEGICALLY, HE ARGUED, A FORCE OF 25

POLARIS VESSELS CRUISING EUROPE'S SHALLOW COASTAL WATERS COULD NOT

EASILY BE DESTROYED BY SOVIET SUBMARINES OR AIRCRAFT . SAID RICKETTS :

/ EACH ADDITIONAL WEAPONS SYSTEM ENHANCES THE CREDIBILITY OF OTHER

SYSTEMS " BUT R.A.F . MARSHAL SIR JOHN SLESSOR CALLED IT " MONSTROUS

MILITARY NONSENSE, " AND MANY OTHER BRITISH DEFENSE OFFICIALS AGREED .

THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S MAIN JUSTIFICATION FOR MLF IS NOT MILITARY BUT

POLITICAL . IT IS AIMED PRIMARILY AT SATISFYING WEST GERMANY'S DEMAND

FOR AN EQUAL VOICE WITH BRITAIN AND FRANCE IN NATO'S NUCLEAR COUNCILS,

AND THE GERMANS ARE ALREADY PLEDGED TO MATCH THE U.S.'S OFFER TO

SHOULDER 40 PER CENT OF THE COST . WITHOUT BRITISH BACKING, HOWEVER,

MLF WILL NEVER GET OFF THE DRAWING BOARD ; THE U.S . IS NOT WILLING TO

SHARE THE FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL RESPONSIBILITY WITH GERMANY ALONE .

BUT THE BRITISH, WHO ARE ALREADY COMMITTED TO BUILDING A $1 BILLION

POLARIS SUBMARINE FLEET BY 1970, REPLY THAT THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO POUR

MORE MONEY INTO ANYTHING AS THEORETICAL AS MLF . EUROPE'S MOST TELLING

OBJECTION TO THE PROJECT IS THAT EVEN IF THE ALLIES DID CHIP IN,

ULTIMATE CONTROL OF ITS WEAPONS WOULD STILL REST WITH THE U.S . WHO

NEEDS IT ? THE KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION HOPES NONETHELESS TO WIN

BRITISH AS WELL AS GERMAN SUPPORT FOR THE FORCE . " WE CERTAINLY DON'T

NEED IT, " EXPLAINED A HIGH-RANKING ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL LAST WEEK,

/ NOR DO THE EUROPEANS . BUT IF IT SATISFIES THEM, I THINK IT IS WORTH

PURSUING . IF IT DOESN'T, WELL, AT LEAST WE MADE THE OFFER . " ALL THIS

MERELY OBSCURED WHAT OUGHT TO BE THE REAL U.S . POLICY AN INDEPENDENT

NUCLEAR FORCE FOR A TRULY UNITED EUROPE ; 2) FULL U.S . RESPONSIBILITY

FOR THE DEFENSE OF EUROPE UNTIL THAT GOAL IS ACHIEVED .

AUSTRIAN THRONE . SOCIALIST LEADERS CALLED OTTO'S PROJECTED RETURN A "

PROVOCATION " THAT THREATENED AUSTRIA'S PRECARIOUS NEUTRAL POSITION AS

A BUFFER BETWEEN EAST AND WEST . ELECTRICAL WORKERS WENT ON A WILDCAT

STRIKE, PLUNGING ONE VIENNA DISTRICT INTO DARKNESS . LEFT-WING PAPERS

ROARED AGAINST " FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC REACTIONARIES, " AND SOCIALIST

POLITICAL BOSSES THREATENED TO PULL OUT OF THEIR COALITION WITH THE

CONSERVATIVE PEOPLE'S PARTY . INDUSTRIOUS ANTS . OTTO WAS FIVE WHEN

AUSTRIA REBELLED AGAINST THE HABSBURG MONARCHY AND OVERTHREW HIS

FATHER, EMPEROR KARL, IN THE AFTERMATH OF WORLD WAR I . THE NEW

REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT EXILED THE ROYAL FAMILY AND PASSED A " HABSBURG

LAW, " WHICH BANNED THEIR RETURN TO AUSTRIAN SOIL UNTIL THEY RENOUNCED

ALL CLAIMS TO THE THRONE AND FORMALLY EMBRACED THE DEMOCRATIC

CONSTITUTION . KARL REGALLY REFUSED, AND AFTER HIS DEATH IN 1922 THE

ROYAL FAMILY SETTLED IN SPAIN, WHERE THE EMPRESS ZITA SET UP A MODEST

COURT . ZITA INSISTED THAT OTTO BE ACCORDED THE FULL PRIVILEGES OF HIS

RANK, ROSE AND CURTSIED WHEN HE ENTERED A ROOM, AND CALLED HIM " YOUR

IMPERIAL HIGHNESS . " A THOUGHTFUL, SCHOLARLY YOUTH, OTTO STUDIED AT

BELGIUM'S LOUVAIN UNIVERSITY, BY HIS SERIOUS DEMEANOR STOOD OFF

PHALANXES OF ELIGIBLE EUROPEAN PRINCESSES . WHEN ONE YOUNG, ATTRACTIVE

HUNGARIAN COUNTESS CAME TO PAY HOMAGE, OTTO STROLLED SILENTLY WITH HER

FOR SOME MINUTES IN HIS GARDEN UNTIL HE SUDDENLY ASKED : " HAVE YOU

EVER THOUGHT HOW INDUSTRIOUS ANTS ARE ? " FINALLY IN 1951, AT 38, HE

MARRIED GERMANY'S PRINCESS REGINA OF SAXEMEININGEN . SETTLING OUTSIDE

MUNICH IN THE VILLAGE OF POCKING, OTTO TRAVELED OFTEN TO SPAIN, WHERE

HE WAS HONORARY PRESIDENT OF THE FRANCO-BACKED EUROPEAN DOCUMENTATION

AND INFORMATION CENTER, AN ORGANIZATION FOUNDED IN 1952 TO BRING

POLITICALLY ISOLATED SPAIN INTO CLOSER RELATIONS WITH THE REST OF

EUROPE . HIS MEMBERSHIP IN THIS SOCIETY AND HIS FRIENDSHIP WITH FRANCO

CONVINCED AUSTRIAN SOCIALISTS THAT HIS ULTIMATE AIM WAS THE

RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF AN AUTOCRATIC MONARCHY IN AUSTRIA . " THE IDEA

MATTERS . " IN HIS WRITING AND LECTURES, OTTO SOUNDED FAR FROM

AUTOCRATIC, SOUGHT TO DEFINE " MONARCHY'S PLACE IN THE ATOMIC AGE . "

SAID HE : " THE NEW FORM OF MONARCHY MIGHT WELL BE ELECTIVE FROM THE

JUDICIARY, PERHAPS . ITS PRIMARY DUTY WOULD BE THE MAINTENANCE OF THE

RULE OF LAW . IT IS THE IDEA THAT MATTERS, NOT THE PEOPLE WHO ONCE WERE

KINGS . " BUT OTTO HAD LITTLE SYMPATHY WITH THE LEVELING INFLUENCES OF

SOCIALISM . " WE HAVE ARRIVED AT A BUREAUCRACY OF WELFARE AND INSURANCE

AGAINST EVERYTHING, WHICH MAY WELL TURN REASON INTO NONSENSE, " HE

WROTE . " THERE IS A DANGER OF A NEW CASTE ARISING OUT OF A CLASSLESS

SOCIETY THOSE IN POWER . " TWO YEARS AGO, OTTO SUDDENLY ANNOUNCED HIS

WILLINGNESS TO ABIDE BY THE PROVISIONS OF THE HABSBURG LAW AND SOUGHT

TO RE-ENTER AUSTRIA . BUT AUSTRIA'S COALITION GOVERNMENT, BALANCED

BETWEEN THE 81 PARLIAMENTARY SEATS HELD BY THE CONSERVATIVE PEOPLE'S

PARTY AND THE 76 SEATS HELD BY THE SOCIALISTS, REFUSED TO ACT ON THE

PETITION IN THE FACE OF VEHEMENT SOCIALIST PROTESTS THAT OTTO'S

POLITICAL IDEAS WERE " FANTASTIC " AND THAT HIS DECLARATION OF LOYALTY

WAS INADEQUATE . OTTO'S ATTORNEY TOOK THE CASE TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE

COURT, WHICH FORTNIGHT AGO UPHELD THE LEGALITY OF HIS DECLARATION OVER

THE GOVERNMENT'S REJECTION . PUSHBUTTON . THE PEOPLE'S PARTY, WHILE FAR

FROM EAGER TO SEE OTTO BACK HOME, WAS WILLING TO ABIDE BY THE COURT

RULING . NOT SO THE SOCIALISTS . " THIS COURT HAS REPLACED THE

PARLIAMENTARY ORGAN, " SAID SOCIALIST FOREIGN MINISTER BRUNO KREISKY .

SOCIALIST LEADERS HINTED A NATIONWIDE RAIL AND ELECTRICAL STRIKE IF

OTTO TRIED TO CROSS THE BORDER INTO AUSTRIA . " ALL WE HAVE TO DO, "

SAID KREISKY, " IS PUSH A BUTTON . " IN PARLIAMENT, THE SOCIALISTS

JOINED WITH THE EIGHT-MAN DELEGATION OF THE SPLINTER RIGHT-WING LIBERAL

PARTY AND FORCED A RESOLUTION DEMANDING THAT THE GOVERNMENT PREPARE A

BILL THAT COULD RETURN ULTIMATE JUDGMENT ON ALL HABSBURG LAW CASES TO

PARLIAMENT . THE LIBERALS LENT THEIR SUPPORT TO THE SOCIALISTS,

HOWEVER, ONLY ON THE CONDITION THAT THE BILL NOT BE RETROACTIVE AND

THAT OTTO WOULD NOT BE BARRED FROM RETURNING HOME. THE CRISIS

IMPERILED THE 18-YEAR COALITION BETWEEN THE PEOPLE'S PARTY AND THE

SOCIALISTS, WHO KEPT THREATENING TO FREEZE OUT THEIR OLD PARTNERS BY

FORMING A NEW COALITION WITH THE LIBERALS . EVEN IF THE OLD COALITION

SURVIVES, THE BETTING WAS THAT ENOUGH TROUBLE HAD BEEN STIRRED UP TO

REQUIRE NEW NATIONAL ELECTIONS SOON . WHILE MOST AUSTRIANS RETAIN

MELLOW FEELINGS TOWARD THE HABSBURGS, THEY WOULD JUST AS SOON NOT BE

BOTHERED BY OTTO'S PROBLEM . " WHY SHOULD WE GO BACK TO WHERE WE

FINISHED 40 YEARS AGO ? " ASKED HELMUT QUALTINGER, FAMED VIENNA

CABARET SATIRIST . " I THINK THAT AS A MATTER OF TASTE, OTTO WOULD NOT

WANT TO COME BACK NOT IF HE LOVES HIS COUNTRY . /

IRAN PROGRESS AT A PRICE FOR THREE DAYS LAST WEEK, TEHERAN

WAS A BATTLEGROUND ; CROWDS SHRIEKED, MACHINE GUNS CHATTERED, AND

SMOKE FROM SMOLDERING RUBBLE MIXED WITH CLOUDS OF TEAR GAS .

IRONICALLY, IT WAS A BATTLE AGAINST PROGRESS . THAT MOST UNUSUAL,

REFORM-MINDED MONARCH, SHAH MOHAMMED REZA PAHLEVI HAS LONG STRUGGLED TO

TURN HIS SHAKY, FEUDAL NATION INTO A MODERN, STABLE STATE . THE

OPPOSITION IS FORMIDABLE . CORRUPT BUREAUCRATS AND OPERATORS ARE

DETERMINED TO PRESERVE PISHKASH (A BRIBE) AS A WAY OF LIFE . BIG

LANDLORDS TRY TO SABOTAGE THE SHAH'S AMBITIOUS LAND REFORM DRIVE ;

(PRIESTS) CONDEMN AS HERETICAL HIS PLANS TO GIVE WOMEN THE VOTE, AND

MORE BITTERLY, PREACH FROM THEIR PULPITS AGAINST LAND REFORM, SINCE IT

WOULD DEPRIVE THEM OF 10,000 INCOME-PRODUCING " SHRINE VILLAGES, "

SOUTH VIET NAM 2-12 THE RELIGIOUS CRISIS A DUSK-TO-DAWN CURFEW EMPTIED

THE STREETS OF THE ANCIENT VIETNAMESE CAPITAL OF HUE, 400 MILES NORTH

OF SAIGON . RIOT POLICE AND ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS PATROLLED THE

DARK AND DESERTED CITY . ROADBLOCKS WERE SET UP ON THE OUTSKIRTS, AND

BARBED-WIRE BARRICADES ENCIRCLED THE SACRED TUDAM PAGODA . THESE

GOVERNMENT SECURITY MEASURES WERE NOT A PRECAUTION AGAINST AN ATTACK BY

COMMUNIST GUERRILLAS ; THEY WERE TAKEN TO QUELL DEMONSTRATIONS BY

HUE'S BUDDHIST POPULATION AGAINST THE REGIME OF ROMAN CATHOLIC

PRESIDENT NGO DINH DIEM . WHILE ALL THE WORLD'S ATTENTION WAS FOCUSED

ON SOUTH VIET NAM'S BITTER STRUGGLE AGAINST THE REDS, THE COUNTRY WAS

DIVIDED BY A RELIGIOUS CONFLICT THAT MIGHT IMPERIL THE ENTIRE COURSE OF

THE WAR AGAINST THE VIET CONG . MORALITY CRUSADE . SOUTH VIET NAM'S

BUDDHISTS, WHO COMPRISE 80 PER CENT OF THE COUNTRY'S 15 MILLION

PEOPLE, ARE BITTER OVER ALLEGED FAVORITISM BY DIEM AND HIS CATHOLIC

RULING FAMILY TOWARD THE NATION'S 1,500,000 CATHOLICS . THE BUDDHISTS

HAVE LONG COMPLAINED THAT THE GOVERNMENT GIVES CATHOLICS THE BEST CIVIL

SERVICE JOBS AND THAT DIEM, BECAUSE HE FEELS THAT CATHOLICS ARE MORE

SOLIDLY ANTICOMMUNIST, PROMOTES THEM TO HIGHER POSITIONS IN THE ARMY .

MANY YOUNG VIETNAMESE ARMY OFFICERS, CLAIM BUDDHIST LEADERS, HAVE

BECOME CONVERTS TO CATHOLICISM TO WIN OFFICIAL FAVOR . " BUT IF THE

VIET CONG EVER COME THROUGH THE BARBED WIRE, " SAID ONE U.S . OFFICER

OF HIS RECENTLY CONVERTED VIETNAMESE COUNTERPART, " I HAVE A FEELING

HE'LL DO HIS PRAYING TO BUDDHA . " BUDDHISTS FEEL THAT DIEM'S

GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO MAKE CATHOLICISM THE OFFICIAL STATE RELIGION,

POINT TO THE MORALITY CRUSADE OF DIEM'S MILITANTLY CATHOLIC

SISTER-IN-LAW, MME . NGO DINH NHU . IN SHARP VARIANCE WITH THE EASY

SOCIAL MORES OF MOST SOUTH VIETNAMESE, MME . NHU HAS BANNED ABORTION,

ADULTERY, POLYGAMY, CONCUBINAGE, DIVORCE (EXCEPT BY PRESIDENTIAL

DISPENSATION), AND THE SALE OF CONTRACEPTIVES . DIEM INDIGANNTLY

REPLIED THAT BUDDHIST LEADERS ARE " DAMNED FOOLS " TO THINK THAT HE IS

TRYING TO SUPPRESS THEIR RELIGION . " I DON'T FORGET, " HE SAYS, " THAT

80 PER CENT OF THE VOTES THAT ELECTED ME PRESIDENT WERE BUDDHIST VOTES

. " CATHOLICS MAINTAIN THAT THEY OCCUPY SO MANY INFLUENTIAL POSTS ONLY

BECAUSE THEIR CHURCH SCHOOLS TURN OUT FAR BETTER EDUCATED GRADUATES

THAN BUDDHIST SCHOOLS . IN A SHARPLY WORDED STATEMENT, MME . NHU

CHALLENGED THE GOOD FAITH OF STRIKING BONZES (MONKS) . " THE ROBE DOES

NOT MAKE THE BONZE, " SAID MME . NHU . " IT IS NECESSARY TO EXAMINE

VERY CLOSELY THE COMPORTMENT OF CERTAIN SO-CALLED BUDDHIST MONKS WHO

CONTINUE TO MAKE NOT ONLY INCONSIDERATE BUT FALSE REMARKS AND OVERTLY

ASSUME AN ATTITUDE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THEIR PRESUMED STATE OF HOLY MEN .

/ PROTEST STRIKE . THE SITUATION CAME TO A HEAD LAST MONTH IN HUE (POP

. 106,000), WHICH HAPPENS TO BE THE SEE OF DIEM'S BROTHER, ARCHBISHOP

NGO DINH THUC . THOUGH CATHOLICS WERE ALLOWED TO FLY VATICAN FLAGS AT A

CHURCH CELEBRATION HONORING ARCHBISHOP THUC, THREE DAYS LATER THE

GOVERNMENT FORBADE THE BUDDHISTS TO UNFURL THEIR RELIGIOUS FLAGS FOR

THE 2,507TH BIRTHDAY OF GAUTAMA BUDDHA . WHEN THE BUDDHISTS STAGED A

PROTEST MARCH AGAINST THE EDICT, GOVERNMENT ARMORED CARS FIRED OVER THE

HEADS OF THE RIOTERS . IN THE MELEE, NINE PEOPLE WERE KILLED . THE

BUDDHISTS BLAMED THE SLAUGHTER ON DIEM'S TROOPS ; THE GOVERNMENT

BLAMED THE KILLINGS ON COMMUNIST AGITATORS . THE HUE DISASTER CAUSED

BUDDHIST DEMONSTRATIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY . BUDDHIST DELEGATIONS

IN SAIGON DEMANDED THE REMOVAL OF RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR FAITH, EQUAL

JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND INDEMNITY FOR THE FAMILIES OF THE DEAD AND

WOUNDED IN HUE . INSTEAD, THE GOVERNMENT ARRESTED DEMONSTRATORS, BLAMED

THE UNREST ON " LIARS, FOREIGNERS AND THE VIET CONG . " WHEN ANOTHER

BUDDHIST CROWD GATHERED IN HUE LAST WEEK, TROOPS DISPERSED IT WITH

CRUDE TEAR-GAS BOMBS THAT SENT 67 PEOPLE TO THE HOSPITAL WITH CHEMICAL

BURNS . U.S . OFFICIALS IN SAIGON FEAR THAT THE MOUNTING RELIGIOUS

STRIFE CAN ONLY BENEFIT THE VIET CONG BY DIVIDING THE PEOPLE AND THE

PREDOMINANTLY BUDDHIST ARMY JUST AS THE GOVERNMENT FORCES ARE BEGINNING

TO GAIN A MILITARY ADVANTAGE OVER THE REDS . DIEM MADE SOME

CONCILIATORY GESTURES ; BUT WITH THE SITUATION FAST DETERIORATING,

THEY MIGHT PROVE NOT TO BE ENOUGH HE ORDERED THE REMOVAL OF THE

BARRICADES IN

HUE AND IN A NATIONWIDE RADIO BROADCAST ADMITTED THAT SOME OF HIS AIDES

HAD NOT SHOWN " SUFFICIENT UNDERSTANDING AND SENSITIVITY " IN DEALING

WITH THE CRISIS .

POLICIES . " THE EAST AFRICAN FEDERATION, WHICH MAY BE LAUNCHED WHEN

KENYA GAINS FULL INDEPENDENCE, PROBABLY LATER THIS YEAR, COULD

EVENTUALLY BECOME A NATION OF 25 MILLION PEOPLE, THE THIRD LARGEST IN

AFRICA . THERE IS NO CLEAR NOTION YET AS TO WHO WILL RUN THE FEDERATION

OR HOW TIGHT IT WILL BE, BUT A JOINT COMMITTEE WILL SPEND THE NEXT TWO

MONTHS DRAFTING A PROGRAM FOR JOINT ECONOMIC PLANNING, THE

ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMON DEFENSE, FOREIGN AND DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATION,

AND A CENTRAL BANK . FEDERATION, SAID THE THREE LEADERS, WILL CREATE "

A FORMIDABLE FORCE AND A VAST MARKET . " AMONG MANY CRITICAL PROBLEMS

FACING THE PROPOSED FEDERATION ARE KENYA'S OCCASIONALLY BLOODY DISPUTE

WITH SOMALIA, PROBABLE OPPOSITION FROM BUGANDA'S FREDERICK MUTESA II (

/ KING FREDDIE " ), AND RESISTANCE FROM KENYA'S 55,000 REMAINING

EUROPEAN SETTLERS, WHO MAY BE APPREHENSIVE OF SUBMERSION IN EVEN MORE

MILLIONS OF AFRICANS . BUT THE FEDERATION SCHEME WAS OFF TO A

GREAT BRITAIN THE TIME OF THE TROLLOP " A GREAT

PARTY, " CRIED VISCOUNT HAILSHAM ON TV LAST WEEK, " IS NOT TO BE

BROUGHT DOWN BY A WOMAN OF EASY VIRTUE ! " BUT THE POSSIBILITY WAS

REAL ENOUGH . IN THE HUSE OF COMMONS THIS WEEK, PRIME MINISTER HAROLD

MACMILLAN WOULD HAVE TO CONFRONT CRITICISM FROM THE LABORITES, PLUS

SOME BARELY SUPPRESSED DISSENT IN HIS OWN PARTY, OF THE WAY IN WHICH HE

HANDLED, OR MISHANDLED, THE PROFUMO SCANDAL . IN THE LONG RUN, THE

TORIES FACED AN EVEN MORE ELUSIVE AND INSIDIOUS THREAT THAN

PARLIAMENTARY ATTACKS THE FACTS IN POLICE DOSSIERS AND IN THE PRIVATE

LIVES OF PEOPLE WHO PERSONIFY CONSERVATIVE RULE . A LIE IN THE NUDE .

THE WEEK LEADING UP TO THE DEBATE IN THE COMMONS CONSISTED MOSTLY OF

TALK BUT WHAT TALK . CHRISTINE KEELER, THE CAUSE OF IT ALL, WAS

STRANGELY IRREPRESSIBLE AND OUTWARDLY SERENE AMID THE TUMBLING OF

FACADES AND THE CRASH OF REPUTATIONS . BLOSSOMING FORTH IN EVER MORE

DAZZLING PHOTOGRAPHS SHE BECAME BRITAIN'S FASTEST-RISING FALLEN WOMAN .

SHE WAS BESIEGED BY FILM AND NIGHTCLUB OFFERS AND INCORPORATED HERSELF

AS CHRISTINE KEELER, LTD . SHE EVEN LANDED, UNCAPTIONED, ON THE COVER

OF THE AUSTERE ECONOMIST . AS FOR HER MENTOR, OSTEOPATH STEPHEN WARD,

HE WAS IN JAIL, BOUND FOR TRIAL ON CHARGES OF LIVING ON PROSTITUTES'

EARNINGS . THE EVIDENCE, IT WAS WIDELY SUSPECTED, WOULD PROVE DAMAGING

TO A GREAT MANY PEOPLE . ALTHOUGH THE LABOR PARTY CONCENTRATED ON THE

SECURITY QUESTION, IN PUBLIC DEBATE THE PROFUMO CASE INEVITABLY TURNED

INTO A MORAL ISSUE . SIGNIFICANTLY, THE UNPARDONABLE CRIME OF

EX-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR JOHN PROFUMO WAS NOT THAT HE WAS

INDISCREET AND A POTENTIAL SECURITY RISK, BUT THAT HE LIED TO THE HOUSE

OF COMMONS IN INITIALLY DENYING ANY RELATIONSHIP WITH CHRISTINE .

MOREOVER, HE LIED STUPIDLY, SINCE HE MIGHT HAVE SAVED HIS DIGNITY AND

HIS SEAT AS AN M.P . BY ADMITTING HIS MISSTEP . AS A LIMERICK THAT MADE

THE ROUNDS OF WESTMINSTER LAST WEEK HAD IT : " WHAT ON EARTH HAVE YOU

DONE .? " SAID CHRISTINE, " YOU HAVE WRECKED THE WHOLE PARTY MACHINE

. " TO LIE IN THE NUDE " IS NOT AT ALL RUDE, " BUT TO LIE IN THE HOUSE

IS OBSCENE . /

SERIALIZED SEX . THE LABOR PARTY RALLIED FOR

BATTLE WITH ENTHUSIASM . RETURNING FROM A WEEK'S VISIT TO MOSCOW AND

PLEASANT IF FUTILE CHATS WITH KHRUSHCHEV ABOUT DISARMAMENT, LABOR PARTY

LEADER HAROLD WILSON HINTED HE WOULD PRODUCE NEW EVIDENCE THIS WEEK TO

SHOW THAT BRITAIN'S SECURITY SYSTEM WAS BREACHED . HE HAD GOOD REASON

FOR CONFIDENCE : THE DAILY MAIL'S NATIONAL OPINION POLL GAVE LABOR ITS

BIGGEST LEAD EVER : 69.2 PER CENT TO 19.8 PER CENT OVER THE TORIES .

ON HIS RETURN FROM A GOLFING VACATION, MACMILLAN'S FIRST OBJECTIVE WAS

TO COMMAND A UNITED CABINET . CALLING HIS MINISTERS INTO EMERGENCY

SESSION, HE ASKED EACH MAN TO OUTLINE PRIVATELY HIS OWN VIEW OF THE

SITUATION . WITHOUT EXCEPTION, THE 21 TOP TORIES EXPRESSED DEEP DISMAY

AT THE PUBLIC'S LOSS OF CONFIDENCE IN THE GOVERNMENT . MACMILLAN WAS

CAUGHT BETWEEN TWO ALMOST EQUALLY UNPLEASANT POSSIBILITIES . HAD HE

KNOWN ABOUT PROFUMO'S DOINGS, AND IN THAT CASE HAD HE NOT CONNIVED TO

SOME EXTENT IN HIS FALSE DENIALS ? OR, DESPITE THE WAR MINISTER'S

LONG REPUTATION AS A WOMANIZER, HAD MACMILLAN REALLY NOT KNOWN ANYTHING

? IN THAT CASE, HAD HE NOT BEEN NAIVE AND NEGLIGENT WHEN HE ACCEPTED

PROFUMO'S DEFENSE ? BED & BAWD . IN HIS OWN DEFENSE, MACMILLAN

MAINTAINS THAT HE WAS FIRST INFORMED OF PROFUMO'S LIAISON LAST FEBRUARY

. HE DENIES REPORTS THAT MI-5 BRITISH INTELLIGENCE HAD WARNED THE

GOVERNMENT AT THAT TIME THAT ITS WAR MINISTER HAD SHARED BED AND BAWD

WITH SOVIET ASSISTANT NAVAL ATTACHE EVGENY IVANOV . MACMILLAN INSISTED

THAT HE HAD NO REASON TO DOUBT A MAN OF PROFUMO'S BACKGROUND (HARROW,

OXFORD, INFANTRY) . MOREOVER, FIVE OF HIS MINISTERS WHO " SAT UP HALF

THE NIGHT " OF MARCH 21 INTERROGATING PROFUMO WERE ALSO PERSUADED THAT

HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH ; THE CLINCHER WAS THE WAR MINISTER'S

READINESS TO DENY MISCONDUCT WITH CHRISTINE KEELER IN A SACROSANCT "

PERSONAL STATEMENT " ON THE HOUSE FLOOR NEXT DAY . MACMILLAN'S

STRONGEST ARGUMENT WAS THAT A SECURITY CHECK, WHICH HE ORDERED A WEEK

BEFORE HIS FORMER COLLEAGUE'S CONFESSION, HAD TURNED UP NO EVIDENCE

THAT THE RUSSIAN HAD SUCCEEDED IN USING THE PROFUMO-KEELER-IVANOV

TRIANGLE TO PRY OUT SECRET INFORMATION . SOMETHING OF A CABINET MUTINY

SEEMED TO BE LED BY HEALTH MINISTER ENOCH POWELL, 51, WHOSE DISTASTE

FOR POLITICAL COMPROMISE LED HIM TO RESIGN FROM THE GOVERNMENT IN 1958

IN PROTEST AGAINST AN INFLATIONARY, VOTE-CATCHING BUDGET . POWELL'S

FEELING THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD ONCE MORE SHOWN ITSELF UNBELIEVABLY LAX

WAS SHARED TO A LESSER DEGREE BY TWO MORE OF MACMILLAN'S ABLEST

APPOINTEES, EDUCATION MINISTER SIR EDWARD BOYLE (WHO QUIT THE

GOVERNMENT OVER SUEZ) AND HOUSING MINISTER SIR KEITH JOSEPH, AS WELL AS

A DISGRUNTLED MINORITY OF TORY BACKBENCHERS, WHO COULD THEMSELVES

OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT IF 20 OR 30 CHOSE TO ABSTAIN THIS WEEK . BUT

MACMILLAN'S ASSURANCES QUELLED THE MUTINY, AND THE TORIES MARCHED INTO

COMMONS OUTWARDLY UNITED TO FACE THEIR GREATEST POLITICAL THREAT SINCE

SUEZ .

AN

ATTEMPT TO FIND OUT THE DATE ON WHICH THE U.S . WAS SUPPOSED TO " GIVE

THE H-BOMB TO WEST GERMANY, " SOUNDED MORE LIKE A PROPAGANDA PLOY THAN

SERIOUS ESPIONAGE . FLASH OF INDIGNATION . THE OPPOSITION MAY YET

SUCCEED IN SHOWING THAT BRITAIN'S SECURITY SYSTEM WAS IN FACT BREACHED,

OR THAT WARNINGS FROM INTELLIGENCE FELL ON DEAF EARS . WHATEVER THE

OUTCOME OF THIS WEEK'S COMMONS DEBATE, THERE IS A GROWING BELIEF THAT

MACMILLAN WILL HAVE TO STEP DOWN EVENTUALLY AND MAY IN FACT HAVE

PROMISED HIS OWN DISSIDENT MINISTERS TO DO SO ONCE THE HEAT IS OFF .

LOOSE FACTIONS WERE ALREADY FORMING AROUND SUCH POSSIBLE SUCCESSORS TO

MACMILLAN AS DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER R . A . ( " RAB " ) BUTLER,

CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER REGINALD MAUDLING AND SCIENCE MINISTER LORD

HAILSHAM . NO MATTER HOW ELOQUENTLY MACMILLAN MAY WEATHER THE

PARLIAMENTARY CRISIS, THE TORIES SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD TO BE TARRED BY

CHRISTINE . WHAT THEY HAVE TRADITIONALLY OFFERED THE NATION IS MEN BORN

AND RAISED IN THE EXACTING DISCIPLINES OF LEADERSHIP . IF NOW, IN

ADDITION TO ALL THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REVERSES THEY HAVE SUFFERED

IN THE PAST YEAR, BRITONS SHOULD CONCLUDE THAT ETONIAN AND HARROVIAN

LEADERS ARE PERSONALLY NO WISER OR MORE UPRIGHT AND IN MANY CASES THEY

HAVE PROVED FLAGRANTLY LESS SO THAN THOSE WHOM THEY GOVERN, TWELVE

YEARS OF TORY GOVERNMENT MAY END IN A MIGHTY FLASH OF MORAL INDIGNATION

MIXED WITH RIDICULE .

. " GETTING CAUGHT . THIS HARSH JUDGMENT MAY OVERLOOK THE FACT THAT

BRITAIN WAS NEVER THE SORT OF PLACE VICTORIAN MORALITY PRETENDED IT WAS

DE LUXE MODEL OF THE BRUTAL, CARNAL 18TH CENTURY CITY WHOSE BROTHELS,

BOUDOIRS AND GIN SHOPS ( " DRUNK FOR A PENNY, DEAD DRUNK FOR TUPPENCE "

) WERE PICTURED BY HOGARTH, RICHARDSON AND FIELDING . SAYS MALCOLM

MUGGERIDGE : " THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN A LOT OF HIGH-GRADE WHORING IN THIS

COUNTRY, " AND THERE IS A LOT OF PAST EVIDENCE TO PROVE HIM RIGHT .

GEORGE IV HAD HIS QUEEN TRIED PUBLICLY FOR INFIDELITY ; IN THE EARLY

18TH CENTURY, AN ARCHBISHOP OF YORK MAINTAINED A HAREM AT HIS PALACE .

THE 18TH CENTURY CHRISTINE KEELER WAS A MISS CHUDLEIGH, WHO HAD BEEN

THE MISTRESS OF THREE PEERS WHEN GEORGE II SPOTTED HER AT A COSTUME

BALL, CUNNINGLY DISGUISED IN A TRANSPARENT GOWN . HER GEORGIAN ERA CAME

BETWEEN TWO NOBLE MARRIAGES (ONE BIGAMOUS) . IN THE 18TH CENTURY

PHRASE, BORROWED FROM NAUTICAL TERMINOLOGY, MISS CHUDLEIGH HAD "

BOTTOM, " OR WHAT IT TAKES .

INDEED, THE BRITISH

RESERVE A SPECIAL ORDER OF VENERY FOR DISTINGUISHED DOXIES SUCH AS EMMA

HAMILTON, THE ONETIME STREETWALKER WHO FOR YEARS WAS CIVILLY SHARED BY

HER AMBASSADOR HUSBAND, SIR WILLIAM, AND ADMIRAL LORD NELSON, THE

FATHER OF HER DAUGHTER . ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL OF ALL HIGH-SOCIETY

HUSTLERS WAS HARRIETTE WILSON, A REGENCY BEAUTY WHOSE GUEST REGISTER

WOULD HAVE READ LIKE BURKE'S PEERAGE ; WHEN SHE STARTED PUBLISHING HER

MEMOIRS, SHE MANAGED TO COLLECT DOUBLE DIVIDENDS FROM MANY FORMER

PATRONS WHO PREFERRED NOT TO BE IMMORTALIZED . BUT NOT THE IRON DUKE OF

WELLINGTON, WHO, WHEN TOLD BY HARRIETTE THAT SHE PLANNED TO CHRONICLE

HIS INDISCRETIONS, ROARED : " PUBLISH AND BE DAMNED ! " SHE DID .

SINCE THE MID-19TH CENTURY, SIN FOR A POLITICIAN HAS MEANT GETTING

CAUGHT AT IT . AT LEAST THREE OFFICIALLY VIRTUOUS PRIME MINISTERS, LORD

PALMERSTON, ARTHUR BALFOUR AND LLOYD GEORGE, WERE INVETERATE ADULTERERS

. THUS THE STATE OF SEXUAL MORALITY IN BRITAIN TODAY IS PROBABLY NO

WORSE THAN IT EVER WAS, AND THERE IS MUCH EVIDENCE THAT IT IS BETTER .

BRITAIN MAY NOT BE A MORAL WASTELAND BUT A BATTLEGROUND IN WHICH A MORE

REALISTIC, LESS HYPOCRITICAL GENERATION IS ATTEMPTING TO WIN LEGAL AND

SOCIAL RECOGNITION OF THE FACTS OF EVERYDAY LIFE . SPARING THE HORSES .

WITH THE LOSS OF EMPIRE AND THE DECLINE OF THE CHURCH AS AN INFLUENCE

IN SOCIETY, BRITONS HAVE TEMPERED THEIR OLD MORAL CERTITUDES . AUTHOR

JAMES MORRIS FEARS THAT HIS COMPATRIOTS ARE BECOMING " CONGENITALLY

INCAPABLE OF DISREGARDING THE OPPOSITE POINT OF VIEW, ARE CONSTANTLY

GROUPING TOWARD SOME GENERAL SYNTHESIS OF EVERYBODY'S POINT OF VIEW ON

EVERYTHING . " BUT THE STIR CREATED BY THE PROFUMO CASE SUGGESTS THAT

THERE IS STILL A LOT OF POWER LEFT IN THE " MORAL MACHINERY . " WHAT

HAS REALLY CHANGED IN BRITAIN ARE MATTERS OF STYLE AND OUTLOOK, OF

CLASS AND ECONOMIC STRUCTURE . FORNICATION HAS ALWAYS SEEMED MORE

SPECTACULAR IN THE UPPER AND LOWER REACHES OF SOCIETY . BUT NOW, SAYS D

. W . BROGAN, " IT MAY WELL BE THAT THE MIDDLE CLASSES ARE TAKING UP

THE VICES OF THEIR BETTERS AND ALSO OF THEIR INFERIORS . " IF THERE IS

NO LONGER REAL POVERTY IN BRITAIN, THE AFFLUENT SOCIETY HAS BEEN EVEN

KINDER TO THE NEW-RICH . IT IS AT THIS LEVEL THAT LIFE IN BRITAIN OFTEN

SEEMS TASTELESS, AIMLESS AND IMMORAL . A NEW TWIST TO A VICTORIAN MUSIC

HALL BALLAD " IT'S THE RICH WOT GETS THE PLEASHOOR, IT'S THE POOR WOT

GETS THE BLYME " WAS ADDED RECENTLY BY MINISTER OF HOUSING SIR KEITH

JOSEPH, WHO SAID EARNESTLY : " IT IS HARDER FOR THE RICH OR THE

RELATIVELY SECURE TO BE PURE . " AND YET TOO MUCH CAN BE BLAMED ON

ECONOMIC FACTORS, LEADING TO WHAT THE ECONOMIST CALLS " THE UNTENABLE

IMPLICATION THAT ADULTERY WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS RAMPANT IF ONLY THE

COUNTRY HAD BEEN DECENT ENOUGH TO STAY POOR . " DECENCY IS OFTEN A

QUESTION OF STYLE . MANY BRITONS FEEL THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG, OR

AT LEAST NEW, IN A CABINET MINISTER HAVING A MISTRESS . BUT THERE IS A

SLIGHTLY SNOBBISH FEELING THAT CHRISTINE KEELER AND HER SET REALLY WERE

A BIT TOO CASUAL . ALTHOUGH IN BRITAIN THE OFFICIAL MISTRESS HAS NEVER

QUITE REACHED THE GLITTERING STATUS SHE HAS IN FRANCE, THE GREAT AND

SMALL AFFAIRS OF THE PAST WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE QUIET, SETTLED,

NEAR-PERMANENT ARRANGEMENTS . A NEW FACTOR, SAYS DAILY MAIL COLUMNIST

ANNE SCOTT-JAMES, IS THE " SLEAZINESS OF THE CROWD WITH WHICH THE WAR

DATE A MAN AND WOMAN EVER HAD . THE SOVIETS ONE DAY LAST WEEK

ORBITED VOSTOK V, PILOTED BY AIR FORCE LIEUT . COLONEL VALERY

FEODOROVICH BYKOVSKY, 28 . LISTEN WORLD, HEADLINED IZVESTIA, SOVIET MAN

IS AGAIN STORMING THE COSMOS . BUT THIS TIME, SOVIET WOMAN WAS

STORMING RIGHT ALONG . TWO DAYS LATER, BYKOVSKY WAS JOINED IN ORBIT BY

THE FIRST FEMALE IN SPACE, LIEUT . VALENTINA VLADIMIROVNA CHERESHKOVA,

26, AT THE CONTROLS OF VOSTOK VI . IN RADIO AND TELEVISION

TRANSMISSION TO THE BREATHLESS SPECTATORS ON THE GROUND, HE REFERRED

TO HIMSELF AS " THE HAWK, " WHILE SHE CALLED HERSELF " THE SEAGULL . /

WEIGHTLESS . SOON AFTER BYKOVSKY WAS LAUNCHED, KHRUSHCHEV GAVE A HINT

OF WHAT WAS TO COME . WHEN BRITAIN'S VISITING HAROLD WILSON ASKED HOW

MANY COSMONAUTS WERE UP, HE REPLIED DELIGHTEDLY : " ONLY ONE--SO

FAR . /

AS BYKOVSKY SOARED THROUGH HIS ORBIT, AT A SPEED OF 18,000 M.P.H. AND

IN AN OVAL THAT RANGED FROM 109 MILES TO 139 MILES ABOVE THE EARTH,

HE DINED ON ROAST BEEF AND CHICKEN, MANUALLY OPERATED THE CONTROLS OF

HIS SPACECRAFT . FROM THE CAPSULE, LIVE TELEVISION IMAGES WERE

PERIODICALLY FLASHED TO SOVIET VIEWERS . BYKOVSKY WAVED HIS LOGBOOK,

LET HIS PENCIL AND OTHER OBJECTS FLOAT IN THE CABIN TO DEMONSTRATE

WEIGHTLESSNESS . ON HIS FOURTH ORBIT, THE COSMONAUT TALKED DIRECTLY TO

KHRUSHCHEV IN THE KREMLIN . NOT YET A FULL-FLEDGED PARTY MEMBER,

BYKOVSKY SAID : " I WANT TO BE A COMMUNIST, A MEMBER OF OUR GREAT

LENINIST PARTY . " AFTER SEAGULL JOINED HAWK, THERE WERE MORE MESSAGES .

SAID KHRUSHCHEV : " DEAR VALENTINA VLADIMIROVNA, CORDIAL

CONGRATULATIONS TO THE WORLD'S FIRST WOMAN COSMONAUT ON THE WONDERFUL

FLIGHT THROUGH THE EXPANSES OF THE UNIVERSE :. A HAPPY JOURNEY TO YOU

 ! WE WILL BE EXTREMELY GLAD TO MEET YOU ON SOVIET SOIL . /

SMILING AT THE TV CAMERA IN HER CAPSULE--SOME VIEWERS DESCRIBED HER AS

RESEMBLING A TOUGHER-LOOKING INGRID BERGMAN--VALENTINA THANKED

KHRUSHCHEV FOR HIS " FATHERLY CONCERN, " ASSURED EVERYONE THAT SHE

WAS FEELING FINE . TOGETHER . HER BIOGRAPHY MADE HER SOUND LIKE A

PERFECT SPECIMEN OF SOCIALIST WOMANHOOD : FATHER A TRACTOR DRIVER

KILLED IN WORLD WAR II, MOTHER A FACTORY WORKER . COSMONETTE

VALENTINA HERSELF WAS A TEXTILE WORKER, NIGHT SCHOOL STUDENT AND

YOUNG COMMUNIST FUNCTIONARY UNTIL SHE GOT INTERESTED IN PARACHUTING AS

A HOBBY (SHE MADE 126 JUMPS) AND WAS PICKED FOR COSMONAUT TRAINING .

THE RUSSIANS , OF COURSE, HAD EARLIER MANAGED A TANDEM SPACE SHOT, WITH

TWO MEN . THIS TIME, THOUGH, THE EXPECTATION WAS THAT THEY WOULD TRY

TO " DOCK " THE TWO CAPSULES TOGETHER ALOFT,

THUS POSSIBLY PERMITTING ONE OF THE PAIR OF COSMONAUTS TO TRANSFER

INTO THE SPACECRAFT OF THE OTHER . EVEN IF THIS EXTRA TWIST DOES NOT

COME OFF, THE DUO FLIGHT ONCE AGAIN PROVES THAT RUSSIA IS AT LEAST TWO

YEARS AHEAD OF THE U.S. IN SPACE, AND MOREOVER, KNOWS HOW TO WOO

THE WORLD'S FEMALES . STATED PURPOSE OF THE VALERY-VALENTINA FEAT :

TO STUDY THE IMPACT OF SPACE " ON THE ORGANISM OF A MAN AND A WOMAN . /

GREECE THE KING WANTS TO TRAVEL THE KING WAS WORKING IN THE

GARDEN . HE SEEMED VERY GLAD TO SEE ME . WE WALKED THROUGH THE GARDEN .

THIS IS THE QUEEN, HE SAID . SHE WAS CLIPPING A ROSE BUSH . OH HOW DO

YOU DO, SHE SAID . WE SAT DOWN AT A TABLE UNDER A BIG TREE AND THE KING

ORDERED WHISKEY AND SODA . WE HAVE GOOD WHISKEY ANYWAY, HE SAID . . . IT

WAS VERY JOLLY . WE TALKED FOR A LONG TIME . LIKE ALL GREEKS HE WANTED

TO GO TO AMERICA . THUS, IN JUST ABOUT THE SHORTEST STORY HE EVER

WROTE, ERNEST HEMINGWAY 40 YEARS AGO DESCRIBED KING CONSTANTINE AND

QUEEN SOPHIA AS THEY WERE CLINGING TO THE UNSTABLE THRONE OF GREECE .

LAST WEEK CONSTANTINE'S SON, KING PAUL, WAS ALSO IN HIS GARDENED PALACE

AT TATOI, OUTSIDE ATHENS, AND THE WHISKEY WAS STILL GOOD . BUT UNLIKE

HIS FATHER, PAUL DID NOT WANT TO GO TO AMERICA . HE WANTED TO GO TO

BRITAIN, AND HIS PREMIER WOULD NOT LET HIM, THEREBY PRECIPITATING A

FIRST-CLASS POLITICAL CRISIS . PRIVATE REFUGE . THE PETTY-SEEMING ISSUE

OF THE TRIP IS ACTUALLY PART OF A WIDER, MORE COMPLEX PROBLEM . PREMIER

CONSTANTINE KARAMANLIS, 56, IS A TOUGH, STAUNCHLY ANTI-COMMUNIST,

PRO-NATO POLITICIAN WHO IN HIS EIGHT YEARS IN OFFICE (THE LONGEST

TENURE FOR ANY GREEK PRIME MINISTER) HAS GIVEN HIS COUNTRY STABLE

GOVERNMENT AND A CONSIDERABLE MEASURE OF ECONOMIC PROGRESS . BUT

LEFTISTS AND LIBERALS ATTACK HIM FOR ALLEGEDLY HAVING RIGGED THE 1961

ELECTIONS, WHICH RETURNED HIM TO POWER FOR A FOURTH TERM, AND FOR

KEEPING ABOUT 1,000 POLITICAL PRISONERS JAILED WHO WERE ARRESTED MORE

THAN 15 YEARS AGO DURING THE COUNTRY'S BITTER AND VICTORIOUS WAR WITH

RED INSURGENTS . COMMUNISTS AND WELL-MEANING LIBERALS OUTSIDE GREECE,

PARTICULARLY IN BRITAIN, THIS YEAR STARTED A CONCERTED CAMPAIGN AGAINST

THE KARAMANLIS REGIME, AND AGAINST THE ROYAL FAMILY NOTABLY QUEEN

FREDERIKA, WHO WAS ACCUSED OF NAZI CONNECTIONS . BERTRAND RUSSELL'S

BAN-THE-BOMBERS JOINED THE FRAY, AND LAST APRIL, WHEN FREDERIKA WAS IN

LONDON FOR THE WEDDING OF HER THIRD COUSIN PRINCESS ALEXANDRA, SHE WAS

SET UPON BY A CROWD OF DEMONSTRATORS AND FORCED TO SEEK REFUGE IN A

PRIVATE HOUSE . BRITAIN'S ANTI-GREEK CHORUS WAS SWELLED BY LORD

BEAVERBROOK, WHO, FOR REASONS OF HIS OWN, SCURRILOUSLY ATTACKED HER IN

HIS NEWSPAPERS FOR HER GERMAN BACKGROUND . WITH ALL THIS IN MIND,

KARAMANLIS ADVISED THE KING BELATEDLY AGAINST A PLANNED STATE VISIT TO

BRITAIN IN JULY . THERE MIGHT BE SIMILAR INCIDENTS DURING THE TRIP, HE

SAID, AND THE GREEK RIGHTISTS, RESENTING LEFT-WING ATTACKS ABROAD,

MIGHT MAKE TROUBLE, TOO, AS THEY DID IN SALONIKA RECENTLY, WHERE A

LEFT-WING MEMBER OF THE GREEK PARLIAMENT WAS KILLED . THE KING'S

PLAINTIVE REJOINDER WAS THAT HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION LONG AGO

AND IT WOULD BE UNGENTLEMANLY TO BACK OUT NOW . THE BRITISH HAD

PROMISED ADEQUATE SECURITY . BESIDES, HE DID NOT WANT TO APPEAR TO GIVE

IN TO PRESSURE FROM THE LEFT . KING PAUL WAS REINFORCED BY PERT QUEEN

FREDERIKA WHO, LIKE HER GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER QUEEN VICTORIA,

STRONGLY FEELS THAT SHE KNOWS BETTER THAN HER MINISTERS WHAT IS GOOD

FOR HER COUNTRY . EMBARRASSING REDS . REBUFFED, KARAMANLIS HANDED IN

HIS RESIGNATION . USUALLY KNOWN AS LOYAL TO THE KING, HE WAS

NEVERTHELESS TRYING TO PUT THE ROYAL FAMILY IN ITS PLACE, BECAUSE OF

WIDESPREAD FEELING IN GREECE THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN A SOMEWHAT-TOO-ACTIVE

PART IN POLITICS OF LATE . AT THE SAME TIME, KARAMANLIS WAS TRYING TO

BRING ABOUT NEW ELECTIONS, CONFIDENT THAT HIS NATIONAL RADICAL UNION,

WHICH HOLDS 180 OF 300 SEATS IN PARLIAMENT, WOULD BE VICTORIOUS .

INSTEAD OF CALLING ELECTIONS, HOWEVER, KING PAUL AT WEEK'S END WAS

ATTEMPTING TO PATCH UP A COALITION OF PRESENT PARTIES IN PARLIAMENT THE

20 COMMUNIST MEMBERS, OUT OF DISLIKE OF KARAMANLIS, ARE EMBARRASSINGLY

BEHIND THE KING . BUT THE ATTEMPT IS DOOMED TO FAILURE UNLESS SOME OF

KARAMANLIS' DEPUTIES JOIN THE COALITION . KARAMANLIS SEEMED UNDISTURBED

BY THE ROYAL MANEUVERING . " THEY ARE TRYING TO BREAK UP MY PARTY, " HE

SAID SCORNFULLY . SNAPPING ONE FINGER ACROSS HIS PALM, HE ADDED : /

BUT I HAVE GOT MY PARTY LIKE THAT . " MEANWHILE, WITHOUT A GOVERNMENT,

THE KING AND QUEEN QUITE LITERALLY DID NOT KNOW WHETHER TO STAY IN

THEIR GARDEN AT TATOI OR START PACKING FOR THEIR TRIP . UNDER THE GREEK

CONSTITUTION, THE MONARCH CANNOT LEAVE THE COUNTRY WITHOUT THE CONSENT

OF HIS GOVERNMENT .

ITALY VICTORY, OF SORTS, IN SICILY " ATTILA IS AT THE GATES, /

THUNDERED ERNESTO CARDINAL RUFFINI, ARCHBISHOP OF PALERMO . WELL, NOT

EXACTLY . SICILY WAS HOLDING REGIONAL ELECTIONS, AND THE COMMUNISTS

THREATENED TO REPEAT THE MASSIVE GAINS THEY HAD SCORED IN ITALY'S

NATIONAL ELECTIONS SEVEN WEEKS AGO . RED BOSS PALMIRO TOGLIATTI HIMSELF

WAS ON HAND TO CAMPAIGN . BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE ISLAND SCURRIED

HUNDREDS OF COMMUNIST SQUADRISTI (SHOCK TROOPS), TRYING TO SWING

UNDECIDED VOTERS . PREMIER-DESIGNATE ALDO MORO'S CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS,

HAVING LEARNED PAINFULLY FROM THE APRIL RESULTS THAT IT DOES NOT PAY TO

PEDDLE ANTI-COMMUNISM SOFTLY, WAGED A TOUGH CAMPAIGN AGAINST "

KHRUSHCHEV'S FALSE SMILES . " THEY COULD ALSO POINT TO SICILY'S

SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC PROGRESS UNDER THEIR ADMINISTRATION . THE

CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS' CAMPAIGN SUCCEEDED . THE REDS, WHILE KEEPING THEIR

PLACE AS THE SECOND LARGEST PARTY IN SICILY (AND THE NATION), PICKED UP

ONLY ONE NEW SEAT IN THE 90-MEMBER REGIONAL ASSEMBLY, FOR A TOTAL OF 22

. THEIR SHARE OF THE BALLOTS INCHED UP TO 24.8 PER CENT , 1 PER CENT

HIGHER THAN THEIR LOCAL SHARE IN APRIL . THE FREE-ENTERPRISING LIBERALS

MATCHED THEIR EARLIER SUCCESS, MORE THAN DOUBLED THEIR REPRESENTATION

(FROM TWO SEATS TO FIVE) . THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS GAINED THREE

ASSEMBLY SEATS FOR A NEW TOTAL OF 37, WON ALMOST 980,000 OF THE

2,300,000 BALLOTS CAST, EMERGED WITH 42 PER CENT OF THE VOTE, A RISE OF

MORE THAN 3 PER CENT SINCE APRIL AND MORE THAN THEY HAD EVER POLLED IN

SICILY . WROTE ONE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PAPER JUBILANTLY : " WE HAVE

BROKEN THE 40 PER CENT BARRIER . " HIS POSITION SOMEWHAT STRENGTHENED

BY THE SICILY RESULTS, MORO WILL NOW TRY TO PUT TOGETHER A NEW

COALITION CABINET BASED ON THE ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS

AND THE NENNI SOCIALISTS . BUT EVEN IF HE CAN THUS CONTINUE THE "

OPENING TO LEFT, " MORO'S AND ITALY'S TROUBLES WILL ONLY BE BEGINNING .

WEST GERMANY ALT LANG SYNE BY BUS, AUTOMOBILE AND SPECIAL TRAINS,

250,000 GERMANS ORIGINALLY FROM SILESIA POURED INTO COLOGNE LAST WEEK .

JAMMING OPEN-AIR RESTAURANTS AND BIERSTUBEN, THEY SWAPPED STORIES WITH

OLD FRIENDS OVER RHENISH BEER AND SCHNAPPS BENEATH BANNERS PROCLAIMING

/ FOR SILESIA . " THE OCCASION WAS THE REGULAR REUNION OF GERMANS

EXPELLED FROM COMMUNIST POLAND AFTER WORLD WAR II . DURING A MAMMOTH

RALLY AT FAIRGROUNDS ON THE BANKS OF THE RHINE, THE GEMUTLICH SCENE

SUDDENLY TURNED INTO A RIOT ; STIRRED UP BY A RABBLE-ROUSING

POLITICIAN, THE CROWD NEARLY MOBBED A GERMAN TV REPORTER WHO HAD

SUGGESTED THAT POLAND IS DOING WELL BY THE TERRITORIES SEIZED FROM

GERMANY AFTER WORLD WAR II . IN GERMAN POLITICS, IT IS AN ARTICLE OF

FAITH THAT THESE TERRITORIES MUST ONE DAY BE LIBERATED AND THAT THE

GERMANS DRIVEN FROM THE AREA WILL BE ABLE TO GO HOME . BUT THIS BELIEF,

WHILE STEADFASTLY MAINTAINED IN PUBLIC, IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY HOLLOW

. FAR MORE REALISTIC THAN LAST WEEK'S MOB SCENE WAS A RARE JOINT

APPEARANCE BY CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT CHANCELLOR KONRAD ADENAUER AND

BERLIN'S SOCIALIST MAYOR WILLY BRANDT, BOTH OF WHOM PLEADED FOR

RECONCILIATION WITH POLAND . THE EMOTIONS THAT CAN STILL BE STIRRED UP

BY TALK ABOUT THE " LOST HOMELANDS " IN THE EAST SOMETIMES OBSCURE A

MAJOR POLITICAL AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN WEST GERMANY : THE

REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL INTEGRATION INTO THE NATION'S LIFE OF 13 MILLION

REFUGEES, ONEQUARTER OF THE POPULATION . HAPPY MIRACLE . WHEN THEIR

TREK TO FREEDOM BEGAN 18 YEARS AGO, FEW THOUGHT THAT QUICK RESETTLEMENT

WAS POSSIBLE . IN ONE OF THE WORST FORCED MIGRATIONS OF MODERN TIMES,

9,400,000 ETHNIC GERMANS WERE ABRUPTLY EXPELLED FROM COMMUNIST EUROPE,

SHOWED UP IN WEST GERMANY IN TATTERED COVERED WAGONS AND WITH EMPTY

RUCKSACKS . AFTER THE IRON CURTAIN SNAPPED SHUT, 3,600,000 MORE GERMANS

MADE THEIR WAY WEST AND HEIGHTENED THE CRISIS . THE NEW ARRIVALS WERE

PENNILESS, HOMELESS AND EMBITTERED . IN THE IMMEDIATE POSTWAR DAYS,

WEST GERMANS THEMSELVES WERE NOT MUCH BETTER OFF . THE FIERCE

COMPETITION BETWEEN NATIVES AND " ALIENS " FOR JOBS OR EVEN A ROOF

CREATED AN EXPLOSIVE CLIMATE OF MUTUAL RECRIMINATION . IT SEEMED AS IF

THE SHAKY NEW DEMOCRACY, DIGGING OUT OF THE WRECKAGE OF HITLER'S REICH,

COULD SCARCELY SURVIVE THE HUMAN AVALANCHE . GERMANY'S " ECONOMIC

MIRACLE " DRASTICALLY CHANGED THE PICTURE . AS THE PACE OF RECOVERY

QUICKENED, THOUSANDS OF THE LARGELY AGRICULTURAL IMMIGRANTS WERE

RETRAINED FOR INDUSTRIAL JOBS, AND BECAME INDISPENSABLE TO THE

LABOR-SHORT GERMAN ECONOMY . SHARING THE CREDIT FOR THE TOUGHER

POLITICAL MIRACLE OF RESETTLEMENT ARE THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC'S TWO MAJOR

POLITICAL PARTIES . COMPETING ACTIVELY FOR THE " REFUGEE VOTE, "

CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS AND SOCIALISTS BACKED A UNIQUE 50 PER CENT TAX ON

ALL PROPERTY THAT WEST GERMANS HAD MANAGED TO SAVE THROUGH THE WAR, IN

ORDER TO COMPENSATE REFUGEES WHO HAD LOST THEIR POSSESSIONS . A SPECIAL

EQUALIZATION OF BURDENS BANK GRANTED THOUSANDS OF LOWCREDIT BUSINESS

LOANS . SINCE VIRTUALLY ALL WERE HOMELESS, THE EAST GERMANS WERE THE

CHIEF BENEFICIARIES OF 6,500,000 NEW HOUSING UNITS BUILT SINCE THE WAR

. REVEALING SIGN . INEVITABLY, THERE HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTMENTS . ABOUT

10 PER CENT OF THE REFUGEES STILL LIVE IN SUBSTANDARD HOUSING,

INCLUDING 700 SILESIAN AND SUDETEN GERMANS WHOSE FLOWERPOTS AND

TELEVISION ANTENNAS EERILY SPROUT FROM THE RECONVERTED BARRACKS AT

DACHAU . MANY STILL FEEL THAT THEY ARE WORSE OFF NOW THAN THEY WERE IN

THEIR OLD HOMES . ONLY ONE OUT OF SIX FARMERS TILLS HIS OWN LAND ;

WHEN HE DOES, IT IS ON A MUCH SMALLER PLOT THAN HE OWNED IN THE EAST .

BUT MOST REFUGEES HAVE GOOD JOBS, AND SOME WHO ARRIVED PENNILESS NOW

OWN THRIVING BUSINESSES . THOUSANDS HAVE MARRIED WEST GERMANS AND

RAISED FAMILIES . MAJOR INDICATOR THAT THE ONETIME ALIENS NOW CONSIDER

THEMSELVES REAL WEST GERMANS IS THE COLLAPSE OF THE REFUGEE PARTY,

WHICH ONCE HAD 27 SEATS IN THE BUNDESTAG . IT HAS HAD NO NATIONAL VOICE

SINCE 1957 ; LAST MONTH IN LOWER SAXONY, WHERE REFUGEES COMPRISE ABOUT

25 PER CENT OF THE POPULATION, IT POLLED A SCANT 3.7 PER CENT OF THE

VOTE DURING STATE ELECTIONS . SAYS HANS KOPLITZ, A SUDETEN GERMAN WHO

NOW OWNS A PROSPEROUS LAUNDRY AND DRY-CLEANING ESTABLISHMENT IN MUNICH

: " MOST, WE PAY LIP SERVICE TO THE IDEA OF RETURNING TO OUR

GUARD, VON HORN TOOK OFF FOR YEMEN'S CAPITAL CITY OF SAN " A WITH THE

OBJECTIVE OF 1) ENDING SAUDI ARABIAN AID TO THE ROYALIST REBELS, 2)

CREATING A 25-MILE DEMILITARIZED STRIP ALONG THE SAUDI-YEMENI FRONTIER,

AND 3) SUPERVISING THE PHASED WITHDRAWAL OF 28,000 EGYPTIAN TROOPS WHO

1,000-YEAR-OLD THRONE . BOMBS AT NIGHT . A PEACEMAKING VETERAN WITH

YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN THE GAZA STRIP AND THE CONGO, VON HORN IS NOT

SANGUINE ABOUT HIS CHANCES IN YEMEN . ON A BRIEF VISIT IN APRIL, HE

DISCOVERED THAT ROYALIST TRIBESMEN HAD AMBUSHED SOME 40 EGYPTIAN

SOLDIERS, KILLED THEM ALL AND STUFFED THEIR SEVERED HEADS INSIDE THEIR

SLASHED-OPEN BELLIES . AT THE TIME, VON HORN GLOOMILY CONCLUDED THAT

THE WAR COULD GO ON TEN YEARS . IN NEW YORK, U THANT BLANDLY EXPECTS IT

ALL TO BE OVER IN " TWO TO FOUR MONTHS . " HOLED UP IN THE IMPREGNABLE

MOUNTAINS OF CENTRAL YEMEN, THE ROYALISTS MAKE HIT-AND-RUN RAIDS IN ALL

DIRECTIONS, HAVE SOMETIMES INFILTRATED AS CLOSE AS THE MILITARY AIRPORT

OUTSIDE SAN " A . THE EGYPTIANS HAVE BEEN ON THE DEFENSIVE SINCE

FEBRUARY AND MAKE ONLY LOCAL COUNTERATTACKS TO REGAIN OBJECTIVES SUCH

AS

WATER SOURCES, SEIZED BY THE ROYALISTS . THE OFFENSIVE IS LEFT TO

EGYPT'S RUSSIAN-BUILT FIGHTER AND BOMBER PLANES, WHICH PLASTER ROYALIST

VILLAGES WITH HIGH EXPLOSIVE AND NAPALM . THERE WERE REPORTS LAST WEEK

THAT THE EGYPTIANS ARE NOW USING GAS WARFARE TO PRY THE REBELS OUT OF

THEIR MOUNTAIN CAVES . IN THE WEEK BEFORE VON HORN'S ARRIVAL, THE

DESPERATE EGYPTIANS MADE AIR STRIKES AGAINST SAUDI ARABIA . A DAWN RAID

ON THE SEAPORT OF JIZAN KILLED 25 AND WOUNDED 300 SLEEPING INHABITANTS

. THE EGYPTIAN EXCUSE : RENEWED ROYALIST ACTIVITY MUST MEAN RENEWED

MILITARY AID FROM SAUDI ARABIA . NONEXISTENT ALLY . WHILE HIS NATION

SUFFERED, YEMEN'S PRESIDENT SALLAL WAS ON A TRIUMPHAL TOUR OF THE

MIDDLE EAST . THOUGH PLAGUED BY CONSPIRACIES AT HOME HE CRUSHED TWO "

IMPERIALIST " PLOTS IN HIS OWN REGIME BEFORE LEAVING SALLAL GOT

TREMENDOUS OVATIONS FROM STREET CROWDS IN DAMASCUS AND BAGHDAD . IN

LORDLY STYLE, HE URGED THE BAATHIST LEADERS OF SYRIA AND IRAQ TO

DISPERSE THE " SUMMER CLOUD " OF THEIR DIFFERENCES WITH EGYPT'S NASSER,

AND GRANDLY OFFERED THE VIRTUALLY NONEXISTENT YEMEN REPUBLICAN ARMY AS

AN ALLY IN REPULSING " ZIONIST AND IMPERIALIST AGGRESSORS . " AT HIS

MOUNTAIN HEADQUARTERS IN YEMEN, THE ROYALIST LEADER IMAM BADR TOLD

NEWSMEN HE INTENDS TO KEEP FIGHTING AGAINST THE " EGYPTIAN COLONIZATION

OF YEMEN, " AND BOASTED THAT IF THE EGYPTIANS EVER DID LEAVE, " WE

WOULD OCCUPY THE ENTIRE COUNTRY WITHIN A WEEK . " AS FOR THE UNITED

NATIONS, BADR SAID, " I AM NOT INTERESTED IN THE U.N., WHICH I ONCE

THOUGHT STOOD FOR JUSTICE . ONLY THE PEOPLE OF YEMEN WILL ACHIEVE A

SOLUTION . WE PUT OUR TRUST IN GOD AND IN OUR PEOPLE . /

SARAWAK AND BRUNEI) TO BE ESTABLISHED AUG . 31 . THE PHILIPPINES CLAIM

A PART OF NORTH BORNEO AS ITS OWN BUT AGREED AMICABLY TO POSTPONE

CONDEMNED THE MALAYSIA FEDERATION AS AN IMPERIALIST PLOT, APPARENTLY

PUBLIC FIGURES LIKE ADLAI STEVENSON, STARRY-EYED U.S . PEACE CORPSMEN,

SPINSTER SCHOOLTEACHERS REALIZING A LONGSTANDING DREAM ALL COME FOR A

VISIT TO DR . ALBERT SCHWEITZER . AT HIS MISSION THREE MILES UPSTREAM

FROM THE GABONESE VILLAGE OF LAMBARENE, " THE GREAT WHITE DOCTOR, " NOW

88, AFFABLY GREETS THEM, AUTOGRAPHING HIS BOOKS IN A FINE, STEADY HAND

. YET, AFTER DEVOTING NEARLY TWO-THIRDS OF HIS LIFE MINISTERING TO THE

SICK OF EQUATORIAL AFRICA AND BEING WIDELY REGARDED AS A NEAR SAINT,

SCHWEITZER IS AN ANACHRONISM IN TODAY'S AFRICA . AFTER A JOURNEY TO

LAMBARENE, TIME CORRESPONDENT JON RANDAL REPORTED WHY : ONCE, TO SEE

SCHWEITZER, TRAVELERS HAD TO BE PADDLED THE 175 MILES FROM PORTGENTIL

ON THE ATLANTIC . NOW THEY ARRIVE BY AIR FROM THE GABONESE CAPITAL OF

LIBREVILLE AND PUT DOWN AT LAMBARENE'S MODERN AIRPORT, NOT FAR FROM A

MODERN, ANTISEPTIC GOVERNMENT HOSPITAL . ON THE SHORT TRIP UP THE

OGOOUE RIVER, THE VISITORS PASS NATIVES SKIMMING BY IN BRAND-NEW BOATS

POWERED BY EVINRUDE OUTBOARDS . FINALLY THEY REACH SCHWEITZER'S

HOSPITAL . SET GHOSTLIKE AMID WILD PALMS AND TANGLED JUNGLE

UNDERGROWTH, ITS TIN ROOFS AND RAMSHACKLE WOODEN BUILDINGS ARE WORTHY

OF RAIN OR THE HEART OF DARKNESS . CHANGELESS ISOLATION . IN THE

HALFCENTURY SINCE SCHWEITZER CAME TO LAMBARENE WITH HIS WIFE HELENE AND

PERFORMED HIS FIRST OPERATION IN A CONVERTED HEN HOUSE, THE MISSION HAS

EXPANDED BUT OTHERWISE CHANGED LITTLE . AT THE RIVER LANDING THERE ARE

ONLY PIROGUES, CRUDE DUGOUT CANOES, THE ONE TYPE OF RIVER AMBULANCE

SCHWEITZER WILL USE . ( " BRANCARDIER ! BRANCARDIER ! " (STRETCHER

BEARER) THE OARSMEN CRY WHEN THEY ARRIVE WITH AN EMERGENCY.) THE

HOSPITAL COMPOUND IS WITHOUT TELEPHONE, RUNNING WATER OR REFRIGERATION,

HAS ELECTRICITY ONLY IN THE MAIN BUILDING, WHICH HOUSES THE TINY,

ANTIQUATED OPERATING THEATER . STERILIZATION IS CARRIED OUT IN AN

OUTDOOR LEAN-TO AND THE ONLY TOILET IS AN OUTHOUSE FOR THE USE OF THE

FOREIGN STAFF . WITH A CAPACITY FOR SOME 400 PATIENTS, SCHWEITZER'S

CLINIC IS FOREVER JAMMED . THE SICK, CARRYING PAPER TAGS WITH THEIR

NAMES, VILLAGES AND TRIBES, WAIT FOR HOURS TO SEE THE DOCTORS, ARE

BEDDED DOWN ON STRAW-MATTRESS COTS IN DARK, STENCH-RIDDEN HUTS WHOSE

EARTH FLOORS ARE AWASH DURING THE RAINY SEASON . OUTSIDE, OVER OPEN

FIRES, THE PATIENTS' WOMEN RELATIVES COOK, WHILE A HORDE OF CHICKENS,

DOGS AND GOATS (PROTECTED UNDER SCHWEITZER'S " REVERENCE FOR LIFE "

MYSTIQUE BY WHICH NO LIVING THING SHOULD BE UNNECESSARILY DISTURBED)

ROAM AT WILL, ADDING FREELY TO THE SURROUNDING FILTH . WHEN A PATIENT

DIES AND HIS BODY IS UNCLAIMED, IT IS WRAPPED IN A FERN-ANDPALM-LEAF

SHROUD, LAID IN A WOODEN BOX, AND BURIED IN THE BUSH . TAILORED FOR

PRIMITIVES . DESPITE SUCH SQUALOR, SCHWEITZER'S INSTITUTION HAS A GOOD

MEDICAL RECORD, AND THE CITY'S EUROPEANS GENERALLY CHOOSE IT OVER THE

NEW GOVERNMENT HOSPITAL . FEW HOSPITALS ANYWHERE CAN OFFER SUCH A

DEDICATED STAFF, OR ONE THAT LIVES AS AUSTERELY . EACH OF THE DOCTORS

AND NURSES OCCUPIES A SINGLE ROOM EQUIPPED WITH IRON BED, ENAMEL WASH

BASIN AND KEROSENE LAMP ; MEALS USUALLY CONSIST OF FRIED BANANAS AND

OTHER FRUIT . THE OLD MAN STUBBORNLY REFUSES TO GO MODERN . SAYS HE :

/ CIRCUMSTANCES COMMAND THAT THE HOSPITAL BE PRIMITIVE IN KEEPING WITH

THE PRIMITIVE STATE OF THE PEOPLE . " HE BELIEVES THAT AFRICANS ENJOY

DISCOMFORT, AND THAT THEY ARE OFTEN AFRAID OF A GLEAMING WHITE MODERN

HOSPITAL, BUT NOT OF ONE THAT REMINDS THEM OF THEIR VILLAGES A CONCEPT

LESS VALID TODAY THAN 20 YEARS AGO . HIS AFRICAN CRITICS TAKE

SCHWEITZER'S INSISTENCE ON PRIMITIVENESS AS AN INSULT, OR A NEEDLESS

PROLONGATION OF " THE WHITE MAN'S BURDEN . " SYMBOLICALLY, THEY POINT

OUT, HE AND HIS STAFF STILL WEAR PITH HELMETS . THE CONCEPT THAT THE

DARK CONTINENT CAN MAKE MORE PROGRESS THROUGH INDEPENDENCE IS, TO

SCHWEITZER, FOLLY . TOLD THAT THE PEACE CORPS IS BUILDING PRIMARY

SCHOOLS ALL OVER GABON, AND THAT THE LITTLE COUNTRY HAS 14 MEDICAL

STUDENTS TRAINING IN FRANCE, DR . SCHWEITZER MERELY CHUCKLES AND SAYS

OF THE BLACKS : " YOU CANNOT CHANGE THEIR MENTALITY . " AMONG HIS SIX

DOCTORS AND 17 NURSES, THERE IS NOT ONE AFRICAN, NOR IS HE TRAINING ANY

. SAYS AN UPPER-CLASS AFRICAN IN LAMBARENE : " I'D RATHER DIE

UNATTENDED THAN BE HUMILIATED AT DR . SCHWEITZER'S HOSPITAL . "

ACCORDING TO THE SUN . BUSHY WHITE HAIR AFLARE, DROOPING MUSTACHE

AQUIVER, COTTON STRIPS WOUND AROUND HIS ARMS TO ABSORB THE SWEAT, HE IS

A LITTLE DEAF BUT ALERT AS A LION . HE IS STILL PLANNING ADDITIONS TO

THE HOSPITAL AND IS WORKING ON VOLUME III OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF

CIVILIZATION . A FEW WEEKS AGO, HE ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD MAKE NO MORE

REST VISITS TO EUROPE, WHICH HIS DISCIPLES TAKE TO MEAN THAT SCHWEITZER

WANTS TO DIE AT LAMBARENE, WHERE HIS WIFE WAS BURIED SIX YEARS AGO . IN

THE JUNGLE, THE DOCTOR HAS BUILT A PRIVATE WORLD FOR HIMSELF WHICH HE

REFUSES TO ALTER . EVEN HIS TIME IS HIS OWN ; THE HOSPITAL CLOCKS DO

NOT RUN ON G.M.T., LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE COUNTRY, BUT ARE SET

ACCORDING TO THE SUN . AS FAR BACK AS WORLD WAR I, SCHWEITZER EXPRESSED

HIS DISLIKE FOR THE MODERN WORLD OUTSIDE : " IN A THOUSAND DIFFERENT

WAYS MANKIND HAS BEEN PERSUADED TO GIVE UP ITS NATURAL RELATIONS WITH

REALITY AND TO SEEK ITS WELFARE IN THE MAGIC FORMULAS OF SOME KIND OF

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL WITCHCRAFT . " SCHWEITZER HAS MADE HIS OWN REALITY

; HE LIVES IN THE AFRICA OF 1913, HARDLY KNOWING OR CARING THAT A

CONTINENT AND A CENTURY HAVE PASSED HIM BY .

GREAT BRITAIN THE LOST LEADER AS THE HOUSE OF COMMONS

CLOCK TICKED TOWARD STARTING TIME FOR THE GREAT DEBATE, THERE WERE ONLY

TWO EMPTY SEATS IN THE JAMMED, EXPECTANT CHAMBER . THE FIRST WAS

FILLED, WITH FOUR MINUTES TO SPARE, BY HAROLD MACMILLAN, WHO SAT DOWN

STIFFLY ON THE GOVERNMENT'S FRONT BENCH, LOOKING AS CHILL AND WAN AS

HIS EFFIGY AT MADAME TUSSAUD'S . TWO MINUTES LATER, A SHORT, PLUMP MAN

IN A SHABBY GREY SUIT BUSTLED EXPRESSIONLESSLY DOWN THE GANGWAY, SANK

INTO THE OPPOSITION FRONT BENCH FACING MACMILLAN, AND FINGERED A

CARDBOARD FILE . AS THE CLOCK STRUCK, LABOR PARTY LEADER HAROLD WILSON

ROSE TO HIS FEET AND FOR A SECOND SAVORED THE TINGLING SILENCE BEFORE

BREAKING IT WITH HIS FLAT NASAL YORKSHIRE VOICE . " THIS IS A DEBATE, "

HE BEGAN, " WITHOUT PRECEDENCE IN THE ANNALS OF THE HOUSE . " THE TWO

MEN WERE THE PRODUCTS OF TWO REMARKABLE POLITICAL CAREERS AND ALSO OF

TWO BRITAINS : MACMILLAN, THE SKILLFUL, COURAGEOUS AND OFTEN RUTHLESS

PATRICIAN WHO HAD RESCUED HIS COUNTRY FROM THE DEBRIS OF SUEZ AND LED

IT INTO AN ERA OF UNPRECEDENTED PROSPERITY ; HAROLD WILSON, THE DRY,

DILIGENT AND OFTEN DEVIOUS SON OF A PROVINCIAL CHEMIST WHO HAD RISEN BY

HARD WORK AND CHANCE (INCLUDING THE DEATH OF THE MAN HE SUCCEEDED, HUGH

GAITSKELL) TO THE TOP OF THE LABOR PARTY . AS HE FACED MACMILLAN, WHO

HAD GONE TO OXFORD BY FAMILY TRADITION, HAROLD WILSON, WHO HAD GONE TO

OXFORD ON A SCHOLARSHIP, STROVE TO EMBODY A NEW, IMPATIENT,

CLASS-DEFYING ENGLAND . THE MORAL DECAY SURROUNDING THE PROFUMO AFFAIR,

HE TRIED HARD TO SUGGEST, MUST BE BLAMED ON THE TORIES . REFERRING TO

CHRISTINE KEELER'S REPORTED $14,000-A-WEEK NIGHTCLUB CONTRACT, WILSON

DECLARED : " THERE IS SOMETHING UTTERLY NAUSEATING ABOUT A SYSTEM OF

SOCIETY WHICH PAYS A HARLOT 25 TIMES AS MUCH AS IT PAYS ITS PRIME

MINISTER . " FOR THE REST, HAROLD WILSON STUCK TO THE SECURITY ISSUE

AND THE GOVERNMENT'S HANDLING OF THE PROFUMO CASE, WHICH HE ATTACKED AS

EITHER DISHONEST OR INCOMPETENT, OR BOTH . LET DOWN . THE ONCE

UNFLAPPABLE MACMILLAN FIDGETED IN HIS SEAT AND KEPT DABBING AT THE

POUCHES BENEATH HIS EYES WITH A CRUMPLED HANDKERCHIEF . WHEN HE ROSE,

HE OPENLY PLAYED FOR THE SYMPATHY OF HIS COLLEAGUES . " WHAT HAS

HAPPENED, " HE SAID, " HAS INFLICTED A DEEP, BITTER AND LASTING WOUND

ON ME . " ESSENTIALLY HIS DEFENSE WAS THAT HE HAD BEEN GROSSLY DECEIVED

BY PROFUMO AN " ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE " CULPRIT AND BADLY LET DOWN BY HIS

SUBORDINATES, WHO FAILED TO KEEP HIM INFORMED . FROM THE BACK BENCHES

CAME A RUDE GIBE OF " NOBODY EVER TELLS ME NUFFIN ! " BY THE TIME

MACMILLAN FINISHED, THE HOUSE WAS PREPARED TO ACQUIT HIM OF PERSONAL

DISHONESTY AND MORAL TURPITUDE, BUT HE HAD CONVICTED HIMSELF OF

NEGLIGENCE AND NAIVETE OR PERHAPS SIMPLY OF A FATAL ABILITY TO AVERT

HIS EYES FROM WHAT HE DID NOT WISH TO SEE . IN THE VOTE FOLLOWING THE

DEBATE, 27 CONSERVATIVES VOTED AGAINST MACMILLAN OR ABSTAINED . ON ALL

SIDES THERE WERE CRIES OF " RESIGN, RESIGN, " AND THIS IS WHAT

MACMILLAN WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY HAVE TO DO THE ONLY REMAINING QUESTION

BEING WHEN . THE WARNING . THE LONG DEBATE SERVED TO FIX GOVERNMENT

RESPONSIBILITY, OR THE LACK OF IT, AND ILLUSTRATED THE ODD NATURE OF

THE BRITISH SECURITY SYSTEM, COMPOUNDED OF SHREWDNESS, INEFFICIENCY,

AND AN OFTEN MISGUIDED SENSE OF SPORTSMANSHIP THAT GOES TO

EXTRAORDINARY LENGTHS IN PROTECTING MEMBERS OF THE CLUB . THE CASE, AS

IT EMERGED FROM THE DEBATE, FALLS INTO FOUR PHASES .

FIRST, THERE WAS THE CHRISTINE-PROFUMO AFFAIR

ITSELF, WHICH, ACCORDING TO PROFUMO, LASTED ONLY A FEW MONTHS, FROM

JULY TO DECEMBER 1961, BUT BY OTHER EVIDENCE POSSIBLY LASTED LONGER .

DURING THOSE SAME MONTHS, CHRISTINE ALSO ENTERTAINED RUSSIAN ASSISTANT

NAVAL ATTACHE EVGENY IVANOV, WHO HAD BEEN PALS FOR SOME TIME WITH HER

MENTOR, DR . STEPHEN WARD . MI-5, BRITISH INTELLIGENCE, APPARENTLY

DISCOVERED ONLY HALF OF WHAT WILSON SCATHINGLY CALLED " THIS DINGY

QUADRILATERAL . " IN AUGUST 1961, ACCORDING TO THE COMMONS DEBATE,

CABINET SECRETARY SIR NORMAN BROOK WARNED PROFUMO THAT IT WOULD BE

BETTER FOR THE SECRETARY FOR WAR NOT TO BE TOO FRIENDLY WITH WARD ; HE

DID NOT MENTION, AND EVIDENTLY DID NOT KNOW ABOUT, CHRISTINE . NOTHING

OF THIS WAS REPORTED TO MACMILLAN . IN THE SECOND PHASE, WHICH COVERS

MOST OF 1962, RUMORS OF THE AFFAIR KEPT REACHING THE NEWSPAPERS, TORY

AND LABOR POLITICIANS, BUT APPARENTLY NOT THE PRIME MINISTER . DURING

THE CUBA BLOWUP, WARD WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE, SUGGESTING TO THE PRIME

MINISTER'S OFFICE AND TO THE FOREIGN OFFICE THAT HIS FRIEND IVANOV BE

USED AS AN INTERMEDIARY TO HELP SETTLE THE CRISIS . BUT SAID MACMILLAN,

A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE THEN TRYING TO GET INTO THE ACT " TO WEAKEN OUR

RESOLUTION . " A LITTLE LATER, WILSON HIMSELF GOT A LETTER FROM WARD,

BOASTING OF HIS SUPPOSED HELP IN SETTLING THE CUBA MATTER, BUT FILED IT

AWAY AS COMING FROM A CRANK . BEFORE IVANOV WAS RECALLED TO MOSCOW IN

JANUARY 1963, HE AROUSED SUSPICION IN OTHER WAYS . A BRIDGE PLAYER WHO

TOOK A HAND IN SOME VERY HIGH-LEVEL GAMES, HE LOST STEADILY, AS MUCH AS

$140 A NIGHT . " I DO NOT BELIEVE THE SOVIET EMBASSY'S PETTY CASH WOULD

STAND SUCH LOSSES EVERY NIGHT, " SAID ONE LABOR M.P . CAUSTICALLY, /

UNLESS THEY GOT SOMETHING FOR IT . " THE VIGIL . IN THE THIRD AND MOST

REMARKABLE PHASE, MACMILLAN FINALLY BECAME AWARE THAT THERE WAS SUCH A

THING AS A PROFUMO CASE . IN JANUARY 1963, AS MACMILLAN TOLD COMMONS

POLICE LEARNED FROM CHRISTINE THAT WARD HAD ASKED HER TO FIND OUT FROM

PROFUMO WHEN THE U.S . WAS TO DELIVER CERTAIN NUCLEAR INFORMATION AND

WARHEADS TO WEST GERMANY (SHE SAID THAT SHE REFUSED TO DO IT) .

MACMILLAN WAS NOT TOLD OF THIS EITHER . BUT WHILE HE WAS AWAY IN ITALY,

THE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE HUGE (CIRC . 6,500,000) NEWS OF THE WORLD

REPORTED THE PROFUMO RUMORS TO MACMILLAN'S PRINCIPAL PRIVATE SECRETARY

. CONFRONTED WITH THE STORY, PROFUMO DENIED EVERYTHING TO SEVERAL

OFFICIALS ; THE RELATIONSHIP HAD BEEN INNOCENT, HE SAID, AND ANYWAY

HAD ENDED LONG BEFORE . WHY DIDN'T THE PRIME MINISTER QUESTION PROFUMO

HIMSELF AT ANY TIME ? MACMILLAN'S LAME ANSWER : HE ASSUMED THAT

PROFUMO WOULD SPEAK MORE FREELY TO OTHERS, AND FURTHERMORE SUCH AN

INTERROGATION WOULD HAVE MADE " SOCIAL RELATIONS " BETWEEN HIMSELF AND

PROFUMO HIGHLY EMBARRASSING . AND WHY DIDN'T ANYONE ATTEMPT TO

INTERROGATE CHRISTINE HERSELF TO CHECK OUT PROFUMO'S DENIAL ? TO

THIS, MACMILLAN HAD NO ANSWER AT ALL . AFTER CHRISTINE FAILED TO APPEAR

AS A WITNESS LAST MARCH IN THE TRIAL OF A JEALOUS NEGRO LOVER WHO HAD

TRIED TO SHOOT HER, QUESTIONS WERE FINALLY RAISED IN PARLIAMENT .

MACMILLAN ASKED FOR ACTION, ADMITTEDLY HOPING FOR A STATEMENT FROM

PROFUMO THAT WOULD QUELL FURTHER RUMORS IN THE PRESS THROUGH FEAR OF

LIBEL . WHEN THE HOUSE ADJOURNED AFTER MIDNIGHT, PROFUMO WAS AWAKENED,

AND AT 1 : 30 A.M . CAME TO CHIEF TORY WHIP MARTIN REDMAYNE'S COMMONS

OFFICE WITH HIS SOLICITOR . HE WAS CONFRONTED BY REDMAYNE, TORY

CHAIRMAN IAIN MACLEOD, MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO WILLIAM DEEDES,

ATTORNEY GENERAL SIR JOHN HOBSON AND SOLICITOR GENERAL SIR PETER

RAWLINSON . TWO OF PROFUMO'S INTERROGATORS HAD BEEN AT HARROW WITH HIM

. WHERE LAST WEEK HE

WAS EXPELLED FROM THE COMMUNIST PARTY, DISMISSED FROM THE INTELLIGENCE

SERVICE, AND SENT TO A MENTAL HOSPITAL .

THE LETTER . UNDER FRIENDLY QUESTIONING UNTIL

5 A.M., PROFUMO DENIED MISCONDUCT WITH CHRISTINE . HE AGREED TO MAKE A

SACROSANCT " PERSONAL STATEMENT, " ASSURING THE HOUSE THAT HE HAD

COMMITTED " NO IMPROPRIETY WHATSOEVER " WITH MISS KEELER . HIS FELLOW

MINISTERS SUGGESTED THAT HE ADMIT AT LEAST TO BEING " ON FRIENDLY TERMS

WITH HER, " ALTHOUGH IT " SOUNDED SO AWFUL, " AS PROFUMO PUT IT . " WE

INSISTED THAT IT MUST BE INCLUDED, " EXPLAINED MACLEOD FATUOUSLY LAST

WEEK, " BECAUSE IT WAS PART OF THE TRUTH . " AGAINST HIMSELF AND THE

FOUR OTHER MINISTERS, MACLEOD ADDED, " TWO POSSIBLE CHARGES CAN BE

BROUGHT . FIRST, THAT WE WERE CONSPIRING KNAVES, AND SECONDLY, THAT WE

WERE GULLIBLE FOOLS . " THEY WERE INDEED GULLIBLE BUT OBVIOUSLY THEY

WANTED TO BE . EVEN THE MOST CURSORY CHECKING WOULD HAVE DISCLOSED THAT

WHILE CHRISTINE MAY HAVE HAD JOIE DE VIVRE, SHE HAD LITTLE DISCRETION .

PROFUMO'S INTERROGATORS KNEW BY THEN ABOUT A LETTER HE HAD WRITTEN TO

CHRISTINE IN 1961 BEGINNING " DARLING . . . " PROFUMO EXPLAINED, AS

MACMILLAN PUT IT, THAT IN HIS CIRCLES " IT WAS A TERM OF NO GREAT

SIGNIFICANCE . I BELIEVE THAT THIS MIGHT BE ACCEPTED . I DO NOT LIVE

AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE FAIRLY WIDELY . " BUT IF IT WAS ACCEPTABLE TO

MACMILLAN, AT 69 A LITTLE REMOTE FROM REALITY, IT SHOULD NOT HAVE

FOOLED THE OTHERS . " WE WERE A BUNCH OF NINNIES, " ADMITS ONE OF THE

FIVE PRIVATELY, AND ADDS WITH EXTRAORDINARY LOGIC : " WE RECALLED THAT

EARLIER CASE, IN WHICH " MY DEAR VASSALL' PROVED TO BE HARMLESS, SO WE

WERE BOUND TO FEEL THAT " DARLING' MIGHT WELL BE SIMILARLY HARMLESS . "

THE EXIT . THE LAST PHASE OF THE CASE BEGAN AFTER PROFUMO PROCLAIMED

HIS PURITY TO THE HOUSE, WAS WARMLY PATTED ON THE BACK BY THE PRIME

MINISTER, AND WITH HIS WIFE, ACTRESS VALERIE HOBSON, WENT OFF TO THE

RACES WITH THE QUEEN MOTHER, AND LATER ATTENDED A TORY BALL AT

QUAGLINO'S, A WEST END NIGHTCLUB . BUT THERE WERE EDITORS AND M.P.'S

WHO KNEW BY NOW THAT HE HAD LIED, AND PROFUMO SHOWED HIMSELF BOTH

ARROGANT AND STUPID IN THINKING THAT HE COULD SUPPRESS THE TRUTH

INDEFINITELY BY LIBEL SUITS . (IN FACT, HE SUED PARIS-MATCH FOR LIBEL

AND COLLECTED OUT OF COURT FROM ITALY'S TEMPO ILLUSTRATO.) BESIDES,

WARD BEGAN TO TALK, AND TO LABOR M.P . GEORGE WIGG HE UNFOLDED A TALE,

AS WILSON DESCRIBED IT IN THE COMMONS, THAT " TOOK THE LID OFF A CORNER

OF THE LONDON UNDERWORLD VICE AND DOPE, MARIJUANA, BLACKMAIL AND

COUNTER-BLACKMAIL, VIOLENCE, PETTY CRIME . " ADDED WILSON GRATUITUOUSLY

: " IF WARD'S STATEMENT HAD BEEN PUBLISHED AS A FICTION PAPERBACK IN

AMERICA, IT WOULD HAVE SEEMED OVERDRAWN AND BEYOND BELIEF . "  WILSON

SENT AN ACCOUNT OF THE WARDWIGG CONVERSATION TO MACMILLAN, WHO TURNED

IT OVER TO THE " APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES, " WHO FOUND NOTHING

DISTURBING IN IT . PRODDED FURTHER, MACMILLAN WROTE WILSON : " THERE

SEEMS TO BE NOTHING IN THE PAPERS YOU SENT WHICH REQUIRES ME TO TAKE

ANY ACTION . /

WHEN JOHN VASSALL, A HOMOSEXUAL ADMIRALTY CLERK, WAS CONVICTED

LAST OCTOBER OF SPYING FOR THE RUSSIANS, MACMILLAN SUMMARILY FIRED THE

CLERK'S SUPERIOR, THOMAS GALBRAITH, WHO HAD WRITTEN THE CLERK SOME

LETTERS STARTING " MY DEAR VASSALL . " GALBRAITH WAS LATER WHOLLY

EXONERATED .

THOUGH POSSIBLY NOT IN BRITAIN, WHERE TROPIC OF CANCER HAS BEEN A

BESTSELLER FOR MONTHS AND THE UNEXPURGATED LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER HAS

SOLD 3,500,000 PAPERBACK COPIES .

EVEN AFTER WARD SENT WILSON, THE HOME

SECRETARY AND THE ENTIRE BRITISH PRESS A LETTER ANNOUNCING THAT PROFUMO

HAD LIED TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, THE DISCLOSURE " DID NOT SEEM TO MAKE

ANY IMPRESSION " ON THE PRIME MINISTER . WHILE ORDERING THE LORD

CHANCELLOR TO INVESTIGATE WARD'S CHARGES, MACMILLAN ASSURED WILSON HE

WAS CONFIDENT NONETHELESS THAT THE SECURITY QUESTION HAD BEEN " FULLY

AND EFFICIENTLY WATCHED " ALTHOUGH, AS WILSON ACCURATELY POINTED OUT,

MI-5 MEN APPARENTLY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT CHRISTINE UNTIL THEY READ ABOUT

HER IN THE PAPERS . AS THE DISMAL FACTS AND ALIBIS TUMBLED OUT IN THE

COMMONS, THE ADULATION AND AFFECTION THE TORIES HAD ONCE BESTOWED ON "

MACWONDER " TURNED ALMOST VISIBLY TO A KIND OF STUPEFIED PITY . AT THE

END OF HIS DEFENSE, MACMILLAN PLEADED : " I AM ENTITLED TO THE

SYMPATHETIC UNDERSTANDING AND CONFIDENCE OF THE HOUSE AND OF THE

COUNTRY . " BUT FROM THE TORY BENCHES, AS HE SAT DOWN, CAME A SOUND

THAT WAS MORE SIGH THAN CHEER . BY TWOS AND THREES, PERTURBED

BACKBENCHERS WENT OUT TO ARGUE IN THE LOBBIES WHILE SEVERAL TORY

SPEAKERS CAUSTICALLY CONDEMNED THE PRIME MINISTER . MACMILLAN ROSE AND

WITH BOWED HEAD LEFT THE CHAMBER . WHO NEXT ? SOME ANGRY TORIES FELT

THAT MACMILLAN SHOULD RESIGN AT ONCE, BUT AT A BACKBENCHERS' MEETING

THE VIEW PREVAILED THAT, AS ONE CABINET MINISTER PUT IT, " THE COUNTRY

MUST NOT GET THE FEELING THAT HE IS BEING HOUNDED OUT BECAUSE OF

CHRISTINE KEELER . OUR PARTY WOULD NEVER RECOVER FROM THAT . " THE

PRESENT CONSENSUS IS THAT MACMILLAN WILL BE ALLOWED TO RETIRE RATHER

THAN TO RESIGN, SOME TIME THIS SUMMER OR FALL . IN PERSPECTIVE, HE MAY

WELL REMAIN ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PRIME MINISTERS IN TORY HISTORY,

BUT FEW CONSERVATIVES WANT HIM IN COMMAND OF THEIR NEXT ELECTION

CAMPAIGN ; EVEN PREPROFUMO, THE PARTY HAD BEEN IN BAD TROUBLE OVER

DEFENSE MUDDLES, BRITAIN'S FAILURE TO ENTER THE COMMON MARKET, AND

ABOVE ALL MACMILLAN'S STOP-AND-GO FISCAL POLICIES AND A SLUGGISH

ECONOMY . ALTHOUGH MACMILLAN HAS SYSTEMATICALLY ELIMINATED RIVALS BY

GIVING THEM THANKLESS TASKS OR SACKING THEM, THE TORIES HAVE A NUMBER

OF HIGHLY PLAUSIBLE SUCCESSORS . CURRENTLY IN THE LEAD (DAILY EXPRESS

ODDS : 4-7) IS CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER REGINALD MAUDLING, WHO IS

YOUTHFUL (46) AND READY TO TAKE CREDIT FOR A PREDICTED ECONOMIC SPURT

THIS SUMMER . HE IS ALSO HAPPILY MARRIED, A PARTICULARLY USEFUL

QUALIFICATION RIGHT NOW . NEXT ARE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER " RAB " BUTLER

(2-1), WHO HAS ALL THE NECESSARY EXPERIENCE, BUT AT 60 MAY HAVE BEEN

AROUND TOO LONG ; AND LORD HAILSHAM, BELLICOSE, BLIMPISH SCIENCE

MINISTER, 55, WHOSE HOPES FADED RAPIDLY WHEN THE GOVERNMENT SAID THAT

ITS LORDS REFORM BILL, WHICH WOULD PERMIT HIM TO SIT IN THE COMMONS,

WOULD NOT BE INTRODUCED THIS SUMMER . TED HEATH, 46, IS GENERALLY RULED

OUT BECAUSE HE IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMMON MARKET FAILURE, AND

BESIDES, HE IS A BACHELOR . WHAT NEXT ? ANY ONE OF THESE TORIES COULD

GIVE LABOR A GOOD FIGHT IN THE NEXT ELECTION, WHICH DOES NOT HAVE TO BE

HELD TILL THE FALL OF 1964 . BUT LABORITES FEEL THEMSELVES CLOSER TO

POWER THAN THEY HAVE AT ANY TIME IN THE LAST DOZEN YEARS . AT WEEK'S

END HAROLD WILSON RETURNED TO THE ATTACK IN THE COMMONS, DEMANDING AN

INVESTIGATION OF THE PROFUMO CASE BY A PARLIAMENTARY SELECT COMMITTEE

WITH SWEEPOING POWERS . THE MORE LIMITED JUDICIAL INQUIRY PROPOSED BY

MACMILLAN, CRIED WILSON, WAS MERELY " A COVER-UP, " BECAUSE, WITHOUT

AUTHORITY TO COMPEL PROOF OF THE ATTENDANCE OF WITNESSES, IT WOULD HAVE

TO COLLECT EVIDENCE " FROM SOME OF THE MOST UNMITIGATED LIARS IN THIS

COUNTRY WERE THERE ANY MORE REVELATIONS TO COME WILSON WANTED TO KNOW

. NOTHING HE KNEW OF RIGHT NOW, SAID MACMILLAN, BUT HE ADDED : " I

HAVE HEARD TERRIBLE THINGS SAID OF ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE THE MOST

AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE OF ALL, CHRISTINE HERSELF, VOLUNTEERED : " APART

FROM THOSE I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED IN MY STORY, I DO NOT KNOW AND HAVE

NOT MET ANY MINISTERS . " MACMILLAN RECOVERED HIS COMPOSURE . " THEY

HAVE DEEPLY WOUNDED ME, " HE TOLD A TORY RALLY, ADDING : " IT WILL NOT

BREAK MY SPIRIT . " BUT THE HOUSE STILL REMEMBERED THE WORDS OF TORY

REBEL NIGEL BIRCH, WHO DURING THE BIG DEBATE HAD QUOTED BROWNING'S THE

LOST LEADER AT HAROLD MACMILLAN : LET HIM NEVER COME BACK TO US !

THERE WOULD BE DOUBT, HESITATION AND PAIN . FORCED PRAISE ON OUR PART

THE GLIMMER OF TWILIGHT, NEVER GLAD CONFIDENT MORNING AGAIN !

WHAT A LABOR GOVERNMENT WOULD BE LIKE IT MAY STILL BE

A LONG WAY BACK TO POWER, BUT EVERY BY-ELECTION AND OPINION POLL IN

BRITAIN TODAY INDICATES THAT A GROWING MAJORITY OF VOTERS WANT A LABOR

GOVERNMENT . IN A FAR MORE PROSPEROUS SOCIETY THAN THE WARWEARY NATION

THAT ELECTED THE LAST LABOR REGIME IN 1945, THE QUESTION IS WHAT LIFE

WOULD BE LIKE UNDER NEW SOCIALIST LEADERS . CURIOSITY IS MOST INTENSE

AMONG VOTERS UNDER 30, WHO HAVE BEEN SPARED MEMORIES OF THE SNOEK

(CANNED MOCK SALMON), " RECONSTITUTED " EGGS AND WHALE STEAK OF

PREVIOUS LABORITE AUSTERITY . SENSING THAT THIS NEW

YOU-NEVER-HAD-IT-SO-GOOD GENERATION IS BOTH WEARY OF TORY RULE AND

LEARY OF SOCIALIST DOGMA, THE LABOR PROGRAM TODAY EMPHASIZES "

PRAGMATISM " AND " RESPONSIBILITY " RATHER THAN HEADLONG PLUNGES INTO

DOCTRINAIRE EXPERIMENTS . THE PARTY'S CATCHWORDS, A HEADY BLEND OF

GLADSTONIAN RHETORIC AND NEW FRONTIER PEP TALK, CALL FOR " A SENSE OF

PURPOSE " TO " GET BRITAIN MOVING . " HOW MUCH OF ITS AMBITIOUS PROGRAM

WILL ACTUALLY BE ENACTED DEPENDS ON THE KIND OF MAJORITY IT CAN WIN AT

THE POLLS . BUT THERE ARE SOME FAIR INDICATIONS OF WHAT LABOR AIMS TO

DO . NATIONALIZATION STATE OWNERSHIP OF INDUSTRY WHICH WINSTON

CHURCHILL CALLED THAT " BURGLAR'S JEMMY TO CRACK THE CAPITALIST CRIB "

IS THE GOAL MOST COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH A SOCIALIST ADMINISTRATION .

TORY SCAREMONGERS EVEN CLAIM THAT LABOR ALREADY HAS A " SHOPPING LIST "

OF 104 COMPANIES IT PLANS TO NATIONALIZE . HOWEVER, AFTER BITTER

ARGUMENT THE LABOR PARTY HAS ABANDONED ITS LONGTIME COMMITMENT TO

PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF THE ECONOMY'S " COMMANDING HEIGHTS . " IT PLANS NOW

ONLY TO RENATIONALIZE STEEL, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY RESTORED TO PRIVATE

ENTERPRISE BY THE TORIES, AND BRITAIN'S TRUCKING INDUSTRY . THE ECONOMY

A LABOR GOVERNMENT WOULD DEMAND BROAD POWERS TO REGULATE THE ECONOMY .

IT WOULD GIVE MANUFACTURERS TAX INCENTIVES AND GUARANTEED ORDERS FOR

EXPORTS, BUT WOULD ITSELF BUILD AND RUN PACESETTING PLANTS IN ANY

INDUSTRIES, SUCH AS MACHINE TOOLS, THAT IT JUDGES INADEQUATE OR

INEFFICIENT . SOCIALIST PRINCIPLE DEMANDS A TAX ON CAPITAL GAINS, WHICH

HAVE BEEN LARGELY IMMUNE SO FAR, AND POSSIBLY EVEN A LEVY ON CAPITAL .

IN HAROLD WILSON'S WORDS, BRITAIN HAS A " LAISSEZ-FAIRE, SOFT-CENTER,

SPECULATIVE, HIREPURCHASE, ADVERTISER-CONTROLLED, STOP-GO ECONOMY . "

TO CHANGE THIS, LABOR WOULD HAVE TO TRANSFORM COMPLETELY THE NATION'S

BUSINESS LIFE . HENCE THE ECONOMIST SEES LABOR'S ECONOMIC AIMS AS " AT

ONCE CONSOLING AND FRIGHTENING . " TO EASE THE NATION'S CRITICAL DEARTH

OF LIVING SPACE AND CLEAR ITS SQUALID LEGACY OF SLUMS, LABOR PROMISES

TO COMMIT MORE PUBLIC FUNDS TO NEW HOUSING AND REDEVELOPMENT, RESTORE

RENT CONTROLS, AND REGULATE NEW CONSTRUCTION . LABOR ALSO AIMS TO BREAK

THE AGE-OLD POWER OF WEALTHY LANDOWNERS, WHO SELDOM SELL PROPERTY

OUTRIGHT BUT GIVE DEVELOPERS LONG-TERM LEASES ON WHICH THE LANDLORDS

CONTINUE TO COLLECT " GROUND RENT . " NEW LEGISLATION WOULD GIVE ALL

LEASEHOLDERS THE RIGHT TO BUY ACTUAL " FREEHOLD " OWNERSHIP OF THEIR

LAND . EUROPE IN THEORY, THE PROFESSEDLY " INTERNATIONALIST " LABOR

PARTY OUGHT TO BE FOR BRITAIN'S ENTRY INTO THE COMMON MARKET, PROBABLY

WOULD HAVE BACKED IT HAD LABOR BEEN IN POWER WHEN THE ISSUE AROSE . BUT

A LARGE SEGMENT OF LABOR DISTRUSTS CATHOLIC EUROPE AND SUSPECTS THAT

THE COMMON MARKET IS A CONSPIRACY TO STRENGTHEN CAPITALISM . BESIDES,

MANY ULTRACONSERVATIVE BRITISH TRADE UNIONISTS FEAR FOREIGN COMPETITION

. A LABOR ADMINISTRATION MIGHT BE WILLING TO REOPEN NEGOTIATIONS FOR

COMMON MARKET MEMBERSHIP, BUT ITS TOUGHER TERMS WOULD MAKE BRITAIN'S

ADMISSION MORE DIFFICULT EVEN IF DE GAULLE'S OPPOSITION WERE TO

DIMINISH . THE U.S . & DEFENSE LABOR WOULD " STAND FIRMLY " BY NATO,

AND WOULD HAPPILY LEAVE THE U.S . IN CHARGE OF THE WEST'S NUCLEAR

DEFENSE AND ABANDON BRITAIN'S INDEPENDENT DETERRENT . ADMITTEDLY,

BRITAIN WOULD BECOME A SECOND-CLASS MILITARY POWER, BUT WILSON

MAINTAINS THAT IT CAN REMAIN " VERY IMPORTANT " IF IT DEVELOPS ITS

CONVENTIONAL FORCES . HE CONSIDERS BRITAIN'S PRESENT DEFENSES " MORE

INEFFECTIVE AND INAPPROPRIATE THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE ETHELRED THE

UNREADY " WHO FAILED TO DETER THE DANES IN 1013 AND PROMISES TO REEQUIP

AND REARM BRITAIN'S ARMY OF THE RHINE . WHILE THE PENTAGON, DREADING

NUCLEAR " PROLIFERATION, " IS CHEERED BY LABOR'S WILLINGNESS TO

RENOUNCE BRITAIN'S DETERRENT, THIS MIGHT STRENGTHEN LABOR'S VOCAL

NEUTRALISTUNILATERALIST WING . EAST & WEST WILSON PROPOSES REGULAR

ANNUAL SUMMIT MEETINGS OF U.S., BRITISH AND SOVIET HEADS OF STATE AT

THE U.N., SAYS THAT THE PROPOSAL WAS WARMLY RECEIVED WHEN HE VISITED

MOSCOW THIS MONTH . LABOR IS IRREVOCABLY OPPOSED TO GIVING WEST GERMANY

NUCLEAR WEAPONS (SO IS THE U.S.) ; IT IS EQUALLY OPPOSED TO ANY

ARRANGEMENT, SUCH AS THE U.S . PROPOSAL FOR A MULTILATERAL POLARIS

FORCE, THAT MIGHT ULTIMATELY GIVE GERMANS A FINGER ON THE NUCLEAR

TRIGGER . THOUGH ANGLOPHILE LUDWIG ERHARD IS TAKING OVER FROM

ANGLOPHOBE KONRAD ADENAUER, LABOR'S OUTSPOKEN FEAR OF GERMANY IS AS

VEHEMENT AS EVER . LABOR FAVORS NUCLEAR-FREE ZONES AND THINNING OUT OF

FORCES TO REDUCE TENSION IN CENTRAL EUROPE, AFRICA, LATIN AMERICA, THE

MIDDLE EAST . IN EUROPE, HOWEVER, WILSON INSISTS THAT " DISENGAGEMENT

SHOULD NOT BE USED BY EITHER SIDE TO UPSET THE BALANCE OF FORCES . " ON

THE BERLIN QUESTION, LABOR AGREES WITH THE U.S . THAT THE WESTERN

GARRISON AND FREE ACCESS TO THE CITY ARE ESSENTIAL . EDUCATION &

SCIENCE LABOR SHREWDLY SENSES THAT THE COUNTRY PRESSING NEED IS FOR A

GREATLY EXPANDED EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM, BOTH TO ACHIEVE ITS IDEAL OF A

CLASSLESS SOCIETY AND TO INCREASE THE FLOW OF TECHNICIANS, SCIENTISTS

AND MANAGERS WHO ARE VITAL TO ECONOMIC GROWTH ON THE SCALE ENVISAGED BY

LABOR . THE PARTY PROPOSES TO ABOLISH UNIVERSITY FEES, START 45 NEW

UNIVERSITIES IN 20 YEARS, AND GREATLY EXPAND EXISTING FACILITIES FOR

TECHNICAL TRAINING AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH . " POLITICS, " SAY

LABORITES, " IS EDUCATION . /

GODDESS OF THE GRAVEL PITS

THERE WAS ANOTHER SWIMMING POOL IN CHRISTINE KEELER'S LIFE BEFORE THE

ONE AT CLIVEDEN . AS A YOUNG GIRL, SHE WOULD OFTEN SWIM IN THE MUDDY

GRAVEL PITS NEAR THE DINGY, THAMES-SIDE TOWN OF WRAYSBURY . ENVIOUS OF

HER LOOKS, HER GIRL FRIENDS CALLED HER THE " GODDESS OF THE GRAVEL PITS

. " / I REMEMBER CHRISTINE STEPPING FROM THE WATER, " SAYS ONE

CHILDHOOD CHUM . " HER HOMEMADE BIKINI OF YELLOW JERSEY WOOL CLUNG TO

HER . " FROM MAKESHIFT BIKINIS TO PARIS ORIGINALS, THE LIFE OF

CHRISTINE KEELER WAS DISCUSSED IN INTIMATE DETAIL LAST WEEK, NOT ONLY

IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS BUT ALSO IN EVERY BRITISH NEWSPAPER . FOR ALL

THE SENTIMENTAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CLICHES ABOUT A PRETTY CHILD FROM A

BROKEN HOME, WHAT EMERGED WAS A CIRCEAN ODYSSEY OF A GIRL WHO ALWAYS

KNEW WHAT SHE AND WHAT MEN WANTED . BRIGHT LIGHTS . HER PARENTS SPLIT

UP WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD . WITH HER MOTHER, CHRISTINE MOVED INTO A

CONVERTED BUS COACH NEAR THE THAMES THAT WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A SHANTY

ON WHEELS . EVEN THEN, CHRISTINE'S EYE WAS ON THE MAIN CHANCE . OFTEN

SHE WOULD CLIMB UP ON THE KNEE OF A NEIGHBOR AND BEG TO BE TOLD ABOUT

THE BRIGHT LIGHTS IN THE BIG CITIES . " SHE WAS FOREVER ASKING ME TO

TELL HER STORIES ABOUT LIFE IN LONDON, " RECALLS THE NEIGHBOR . /

I SPENT HOURS TELLING HER ABOUT HER

DREAMLAND . " CHRISTINE EVENTUALLY TOOK A JOB IN A LONDON DRESS HOUSE .

AT A SMALL SOHO CAFE CALLED THE ZODIAC, SHE MET A SPANISH WAITER NAMED

CARLO, BEGAN SPENDING WEEKENDS WITH HIM AT HIS SEEDY SOHO BOARDINGHOUSE

. THEN A GIRL FRIEND INTRODUCED HER TO A U.S . AIR FORCE SERGEANT . "

NIGHT AFTER NIGHT WE WHOOPED IT UP WITH THE YANKS, " RECALLS THE FRIEND

. " THEY WERE TWELVE VERY GAY MONTHS . " BUT CHRISTINE GOT PREGNANT,

GAVE BIRTH PREMATURELY TO A SON SHE CALLED PETER . THE INFANT DIED SIX

DAYS LATER . CHRISTINE WAS JUST 17 . OUT OF WORK AND SHORT OF CASH,

CHRISTINE BECAME THE MISTRESS OF A RICH ROLLSROYCE-DRIVING REAL ESTATE

MAN, WHO SET HER UP IN A LUXURIOUS FLAT OFF BAKER STREET . BUT THE

AFFAIR PROVED UNSATISFACTORY, AND SHE WENT TO WORK AS A WAITRESS, THEN

AS A SHOWGIRL IN MURRAY'S CABARET CLUB . " AND THEN, " CHRISTINE SAID,

/ I BEGAN MEETING MY FIRST INTERESTING MALE COMPANIONS . /

NO MAN'S COLLAR . ONE WAS STEPHEN

WARD, AND A FEW MONTHS AFTER THEY MET IN 1959, CHRISTINE MOVED INTO HIS

FLAT IN WIMPOLE MEWS . " IT WAS A SORT OF BROTHER-AND-SISTER

RELATIONSHIP, " SAID CHRISTINE, " NOTHING ELSE . " A FEATURE OF WARD'S

APARTMENT WAS A ONE-WAY MIRROR PERMITTING OBSERVATION OF THE BEDROOM

FROM THE LIVING ROOM ; THIS ELABORATE PEEPHOLE WAS COVERED BY A

PICTURE OF BUDDHA WHEN NOT IN USE . " THAT WAS INSTALLED BY AN OLD

ECCENTRIC WHO USED TO OWN THIS PLACE, " WARD SAID . " I'M GOING TO HAVE

IT FILLED IN . " AN ELABORATE PRACTICAL JOKER, WARD OFTEN PUT A DOG

COLLAR AROUND CHRISTINE'S NECK AND LED HER AROUND LONDON ON A LEASH .

SOMETIMES CHRISTINE RECEIVED GUESTS WEARING NOTHING BUT SKINTIGHT BLUE

JEANS, ONCE GAVE A PARTY AT WHICH ALL THE GUESTS SAT DRINKING CHAMPAGNE

IN HER BATHROOM . ONE OF HER THIRSTIEST FRIENDS WAS EVGENY IVANOV .

THOUGH HE WAS A BIT OF A PRIG, IVANOV WAS A DEVOTED READER OF THE

STEAMY JAMES BOND NOVELS, FOUND THEM AMUSING BUT RIDICULOUS . " HE

PROFESSED TO DISLIKE LOOSE WOMEN, DID NOT LIKE CHRISTINE EVEN TO USE

COSMETICS . BUT ONE HOT JULY NIGHT, RECALLS CHRISTINE, IVANOV FINALLY "

CAME TO FORSAKE ALL HIS PRINCIPLES AND HIS PRIDE . SUDDENLY HE WAS

KISSING ME, ROLLING HIS DARK CURLS INTO MY NECK . . . " AFTERWARD,

IVANOV WAS " SAD, VERY SAD . " CHARMING BUT WARY . THAT VERY SAME

WEEKEND CHRISTINE HAD MET JACK PROFUMO FOR THE FIRST TIMES AT CLIVEDEN,

AND CHRISTINE, WHO WAS VISITING WARD AT HIS COTTAGE ON THE GROUNDS, WAS

STEALING A NUDE MOONLIGHT SWIM IN ASTOR'S POOL . SUDDENY BILL ASTOR

APPEARED WITH SOME GUESTS, INCLUDING PROFUMO . FRANTICALLY CLUTCHING A

TOWEL AROUND HER DRIPPING SELF, CHRISTINE WAS INTRODUCED TO BOTH JACK

AND HIS WIFE, VALERIE HOBSON . " SHE WAS VERY CHARMING, " SAID

CHRISTINE, " BUT SEEMED WARY OF ME . " NEXT DAY, CHRISTINE BROUGHT

IVANOV OUT TO CLIVEDEN, AND THE RUSSIAN AND PROFUMO HELD A SWIMMING

RACE, WHICH JACK ONLY WON BY CHEATING . " THAT WILL TEACH YOU TO TRUST

THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, " PROFUMO TOLD IVANOV . LATER THAT SAME DAY, HE

ASKED CHRISTINE FOR HER TELEPHONE NUMBER ; SHE TOLD HIM TO GET IT FROM

WARD .

JACK AND CHRISTINE MET

SEVERAL TIMES IN WARD'S FLAT . " MENTALLY, WE BECAME VERY CLOSE, " SAID

CHRISTINE . IT HAPPENED, JUST LIKE IT HAPPENED WITH IVANOV . AT LEAST

THAT IS HOW CHRISTINE TOLD IT IN THE NEWS OF THE WORLD : " THERE WAS

ONE OF THOSE ELECTRIC, POTENT SILENCES, AND HE WAS KISSING ME AND I WAS

RETURNING HIS KISSES WITH EVERYTHING I SUDDENLY FELT FOR HIM . " ONCE,

WHEN VALERIE WAS IN IRELAND ON HOLIDAY, PROFUMO TOOK CHRISTINE TO HIS

HOUSE IN REGENT'S PARK . " WE CREPT AROUND THE LOVELY ROOMS AND THEN WE

GOT TO THEIR BEDROOM . " MARVELLOUS PLACE . CHRISTINE ALSO CAVORTED

WITH MEMBERS OF LONDON'S VAST WEST INDIAN CONTINGENT, HAD AFFAIRS WITH

JAMAICAN JOHNNIE EDGECOMBE AND SINGER LUCKY GORDON . " WHEN I FIRST MET

HER, " SAID GORDON, " SHE WAS ASKING THE WAITRESS IN A CAFE WHERE SHE

COULD GET SOME INDIAN HEMP (MARIJUANA) . KNOWING THIS, I WANTED TO KNOW

HER . " THERE WERE A NUMBER OF OTHERS . SCOTLAND YARD IS SAID TO HAVE

CHRISTINE'S NOTEBOOK, AND THE NOTEBOOK IS SAID TO BE FULL OF NAMES .

THROUGHOUT, CHRISTINE NEVER FORGOT THE GRAVEL PITS OR MUM . WHEN SHE

TOOK TEMPORARY REFUGE IN SPAIN LAST MARCH, CHRISTINE SENT A POSTCARD

HOME .

/ MARVELLOUS PLACE, /

RUSSIA WOMEN ARE DIFFERENT TO HEAR THE RUSSIANS TELL IT, ALL THE

WORLD'S WOMEN WERE IN CHAINS BEFORE VALENTINA VLADIMIROVNA TERESHKOVA .

AS THE FIRST WOMAN COSMONAUT LOOPED THE EARTH, TASS EXULTED : " A

BRILLIANT STAR HAS FLARED UP IN THE COSMIC FIRMAMENT . IT OUTSHINES ALL

THE FILM STARS IN THE WORLD . NEVER AND IN NO COUNTRY DID WOMEN EVER

ATTAIN SUCH HEIGHT . " IN EVERY RUSSIAN VILLAGE, WOMEN CELEBRATED, AND

CONGRATULATIONS WERE FIRED ALOFT FROM SUCH SOVIET HEROINES AS LYUBI LI,

DESCRIBED IN THE PRESS AS " THE RENOWNED CORN PLANTER AND HERO

OF SOCIALIST LABOR . " IN HER SPACE CAPSULE, VOSTOK VI, " VALYA " WAS

STILL THE COMPLEAT SOVIET WOMAN . HER SPACE SUIT WAS EMBROIDERED WITH A

SNOW-WHITE DOVE, AND SHE HAD HAD HER HAIR DONE BEFORE BLASTOFF . ONCE A

TOMBOY, SHE NOW HAS AN ADMITTED WEAKNESS FOR SPIKED HEELS, STYLISH

CLOTHES, AND A PERFUME CALLED RED MOSCOW . FROM SPACE SHE RADIOED

GROUND CONTROL : " PLEASE TELL MAMMA NOT TO WORRY . " ONCE, WHEN

GROUND SCIENTISTS LOST CONTACT WITH " SEAGULL " (VALYA'S ORBITAL CALL

NAME), THEY HASTILY ORDERED HER COSMIC COMPANION IN VOSTOK V, LIEUT .

COLONEL VALERY FEODOROVICH BYKOVSKY, TO TRY AND ROUSE HER . " SORRY, I

WAS HAVING A SNOOZE, " APOLOGIZED VALYA . MISSED RENDEZVOUS . OVER

THEIR RADIOS, VALYA AND VALERY SANG SONGS OF FRIENDSHIP TO EACH OTHER,

FLASHED " BEST WISHES TO THE INDUSTRIOUS AMERICAN PEOPLE " AND " WARM

GREETINGS TO THE MULTIMILLIONED CHINESE . " LOOSENING THEIR HARNESSES,

BOTH COSMONAUTS PERFORMED CALISTHENICS WHILE FLOATING WEIGHTLESSLY IN

THEIR CABINS . BUT THOUGH THE TWO VOSTOKS PASSED WITHIN THREE MILES OF

EACH OTHER, THEIR ORBITAL PATHS WERE SO DIVERGENT THAT THEY COULD NOT

RENDEZVOUS . SINCE U.S . SCIENTISTS HAD FULLY EXPECTED THE TWO CAPSULES

TO LINK UP IN SPACE, THEY SPECULATED THAT SOVIET SCIENTISTS HAD MADE A

LAUNCHING MISCALCULATION . THREE DAYS AND 48 ORBITS AFTER TAKEOFF,

VALYA RE-ENTERED THE ATMOSPHERE, WAS EJECTED FROM HER CAPSULE AND

FLOATED TO EARTH BY PARACHUTE NEAR A SMALL VILLAGE IN KAZAKHSTAN ;

SLOWED BY ANOTHER PARACHUTE, THE EMPTY VOSTOK VI LANDED NEAR BY . TWO

HOURS AND 46 MINUTES LATER AND SOME 500 MILES AWAY, BYKOVSKY LANDED

SIMILARLY IN THE MEADOW OF A COLLECTIVE FARM AFTER A RECORD 81 ORBITS

AND 119 HOURS ALOFT . BUT BYKOVSKY WAS ALL BUT FORGOTTEN IN THE FUROR

OVER VALYA . TELEVISION COMMENTATORS DESCRIBED HER " CORNFLOWER BLUE

EYES, " AND PEASANTS SHOWERED HER WITH BOUQUETS . OVERCOME BY HER

WELCOME, VALYA BROKE INTO TEARS ; IT WAS THE FIRST TIME, MOSCOW

ASSURED THE WORLD, THAT ANYONE HAD SEEN HER CRY SINCE SHE WAS A CHILD .

IN A TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV, SHE ADMITTED THAT

SHE HAD BRUISED HER NOSE IN LANDING, SAID THAT THE " PEOPLE RECEIVED ME

VERY CORDIALLY IN THE RUSSIAN MANNER WITH BREAD AND SALT . "

FORESIGHTEDLY, SHE HAD BROUGHT ALONG PHOTOGRAPHS OF HERSELF AND PASSED

THEM OUT TO WORKERS WHO GREETED HER, GIVING MOST OF THE PICTURES TO

WOMEN . " I PREFER WOMEN TODAY, " SHE SAID . " THE MEN SHOULDN'T

COMPLAIN . " WHEN SHE FLEW INTO MOSCOW FOR HER OFFICIAL RECEPTION THREE

DAYS LATER, VALYA WAS GREETED BY MORE FLOWERS THAN ANYONE HAD EVER

REMEMBERED SEEING BEFORE IN THE RUSSIAN CAPITAL, A BEAR HUG AND KISS

FROM KHRUSHCHEV, AND HER BEST BEAU, BACHELOR COSMONAUT ANDRIAN

NIKOLAYEV . PAPER DOLLS . THOUGH RUSSIA'S SECOND DOUBLE SHOT ADDED

LITTLE NEW TO SPACE TECHNOLOGY, THE FACT THAT VALYA WAS NOT A PILOT AND

ADMITTEDLY WAS MECHANICALLY UNSOPHISTICATED RAISED THE QUESTION OF WHY

U.S . ASTRONAUTS ALL MUST BE SKILLED TEST PILOTS . THE ANSWER FROM NASA

OFFICIALS : USE OF TEST PILOTS PERMITS THE ELIMINATION OF

SPACE-CONSUMING AUTOMATIC EQUIPMENT IN THE CRAMPED CAPSULES . BUT SOME

AUTHORITIES ARE CONVINCED THAT YOUNG SCIENTISTS WOULD BE FAR MORE

EFFECTIVE IN OBSERVING AND ANALYZING UNEXPECTED SPACE FLIGHT

PHENOMENA. SAYS CLINTON ANDERSON, CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE SPACE

COMMITTEE : " THE RUSSIANS HAVE PROVED TO US THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO

HAVE 20 YEARS OF TEST-PILOT EXPERIENCE BEFORE YOU CAN HANDLE ONE OF

THESE CAPSULES FERVENT AGREEMENT WAS VOICED BY U.S . FEMINISTS . SAID

JANE HART, WIFE OF MICHIGAN SENATOR PHILIP HART AND LEADER IN THE FIGHT

TO GET WOMEN ASTRONAUTS ACCEPTED BY SOLIDLY MISOGYNISTIC NASA : " I'M

TEMPTED TO GO OUT TO THE BARN AND TELL THE STORY TO MY HORSE AND LISTEN

TO HIM LAUGH . " ADDED CLARE BOOTHE LUCE : " WE MUST STOP TRYING TO

MAKE PAPER DOLLS OF OUR WOMEN . " ANTHROPOLOGIST MARGARET MEAD WARNED

: " THE RUSSIANS TREAT MEN AND WOMEN INTERCHANGEABLY . WE TREAT MEN

AND WOMEN DIFFERENTLY . " AND VIVE LA DIFFERENCE, SAID AT LEAST ONE

RUSSIAN MALE LAST WEEK . " MY AGE AND CONSERVATIVE MENTAL MAKEUP

COMPELLED ME TO THINK UP TO THE LAST FEW DAYS THAT WE MEN WERE THE

RULERS OF MAN'S MIND AND THE SALT OF THE EARTH, " SAID NOVELIST MIKHAIL

(AND QUIET FLOWS THE DON) SHOLOKHOV . " AND WHAT DO WE SEE NOW ? A

WOMAN IN SPACE ! SAY WHAT YOU WILL, THIS IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE . IT

CONTRADICTS ALL MY SET CONCEPTIONS OF THE WORLD AND ITS POSSIBILITIES .

MANY SCIENTISTS

DOUBT ASTRONAUT GORDON COOPER'S REPORT OF SEEING TRUCKS ON THE ROAD

AND SMOKE COMING OUT OF CHIMNEYS IN TIBET . ACCORDING TO DR . W . R .

COMMUNISTS NOW FOR THE MAIN EVENT NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV HAD MORE

REASONS LAST WEEK TO WONDER WHY HE EVER INVITED A RED CHINESE

DELEGATION TO MOSCOW . TWENTY-FIVE REASONS, TO BE EXACT, ALL NEATLY

NUMBERED IN A LETTER FOR CONVENIENT " POINT-BY-POINT DISCUSSION " AT

THE SCHEDULED SINO-SOVIET MEETING NEXT WEEK . MAO TSE-TUNG'S LATEST

MESSAGE TO NIKITA THE MOST VEHEMENT TO DATE IN THE CONTINUING QUARREL

DOOMED THE CONFRONTATION TO FAILURE BEFORE IT BEGAN . PEKING

DELIBERATELY LEFT THE KREMLIN NO ROOM FOR COMPROMISE . AFTER YEARS OF

DISCUSSION OVER WHETHER THE SPLIT WAS REAL, WESTERN SKEPTICS COULD NO

LONGER DOUBT THAT IT WAS DEEP, JAGGED, AND UNBRIDGEABLE FOR A LONG TIME

TO COME . PARROT & STICK . IN 24,000 BRAZENLY CONTEMPTUOUS WORDS, MAO

ACCUSED KHRUSHCHEV OF SPAWNING A NEW PERSONALITY CULT WORSE THAN

STALIN'S, ASSAILED THE KREMLIN FOR " GREAT POWER CHAUVINISM AND

ECONOMIC PRESSURE " AGAINST OTHER RED NATIONS, CHARGED THE SOVIETS WITH

TRYING TO PURGE FOREIGN COMMUNIST PARTIES . EXCLAIMED RED CHINA : "

WHAT IS ALL THIS IF NOT SUBVERSION ? " AT THE SAME TIME, PEKING WAS

NOT ABOVE ATTEMPTING SOME SUBVERSION OF ITS OWN . APPEALING TO MOSCOW'S

EAST EUROPEAN SATELLITES, THE STATEMENT DECLARED : " IF A PARTY CANNOT

USE ITS BRAINS TO THINK FOR ITSELF, BUT INSTEAD IS A PARTY THAT PARROTS

THE WORDS OF OTHERS, RUNS HITHER AND THITHER IN RESPONSE TO THE BATON

OF CERTAIN PERSONS ABROAD, SUCH A PARTY IS INCAPABLE OF LEADING THE

MASSES . " THE CRUX OF THE CHINESE DISPUTE WITH RUSSIA REMAINED

MOSCOW'S PROPAGANDA LINE OF PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE WITH THE WEST . THIS

POLICY, SAID PEKING SCORNFULLY, WAS PLUCKED OUT OF " SOME MYSTICAL BOOK

FROM HEAVEN " ; MOREOVER, THOSE WHO DARE TO DISAGREE ARE TREATED " AS

HERETICS DESERVING TO BE BURNED AT THE STAKE . HOW CAN THE CHINESE

COMMUNISTS AGREE ? THEY CANNOT . IT IS IMPOSSIBLE . " AS ALWAYS,

PEKING STUCK TO THE DOGMA THAT THE ROAD TO VIOLENT REVOLUTION IN

AFRICA, ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA WAS THE ONLY PATH A TRUE MARXIST COULD

FOLLOW . AS FOR SOVIET CHARGES OF WARMONGERING, THE RED CHINESE REPLIED

WITH AN ARGUMENT THAT, IRONICALLY, ECHOED SOME PENTAGON STRATEGISTS .

BRUSH-FIRE WARS, DECLARED PEKING, NEED NOT NECESSARILY ESCALATE INTO AN

ALL-OUT NUCLEAR STRUGGLE . TRUTH WAS, DECLARED THE MANIFESTO, THE

RUSSIANS WERE TOO SELFISH AND SCARED TO RISK THEIR BOURGEOIS GAINS IN

FAR-OFF BATTLES . " TO PUT IT BLUNTLY, " SAID RED CHINA, " WHOEVER

CONSIDERS THAT A REVOLUTION CAN BE MADE ONLY IF EVERYTHING IS PLAIN

SAILING, ONLY IF THERE IS AN ADVANCE GUARANTEE AGAINST FAILURE, IS

CERTAINLY NOT A REVOLUTIONARY . " KEEP TALKING . PEKING'S PUNCH WAS

NEATLY TIMED TO CATCH THE KREMLIN OFF BALANCE . IT LANDED ON THE EVE OF

A SPECIAL CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEETING CALLED TO DISCUSS RUSSIA'S INTERNAL

IDEOLOGICAL TROUBLES . FOR FOUR DAYS THE RUSSIANS WERE STUNNED AND

SPEECHLESS . FINALLY THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE ANGRILY ANNOUNCED THAT IT

WOULD NOT EVEN BOTHER TO PUBLISH RED CHINA'S " DISTORTED, UNWARRANTED

ATTACK . " CHINESE COMMUNIST NEWSPAPERS TRIUMPHANTLY HEADLINED RUSSIA'S

REFUSAL TO PRINT THE CHINESE DOCUMENT . EVEN RUSSIA'S VAUNTED SPACE

FEATS WERE NOTHING THAT NIKITA COULD TAKE CREDIT FOR . " DURING THE

STALIN ERA HE WAS A THIRDOR EVEN FOURTH-RATE MAN, " THE NEWSPAPER

REPORTED . " HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH NUCLEAR AND SPACE DEVELOPMENTS .

/ IN RUSSIA'S OWN BAILIWICK, THE CHINESE REDS ALSO STAYED ON THE

OFFENSIVE . COMMUNIST RUMANIA, WHICH HAS BEEN FEUDING WITH THE KREMLIN

OVER MOSCOW'S INTERFERENCE IN ITS ECONOMIC AFFAIRS, GLEEFULLY PUBLISHED

A LENGTHY SUMMARY OF THE RED CHINESE INDICTMENT . PEKING'S EMBASSY IN

MOSCOW BOLDLY DISTRIBUTED RUSSIAN-LANGUAGE COPIES OF ITS MANIFESTO .

CALLERS WERE GREETED BY AN ATTACHE, AND AFTER A POLITE CHAT OVER TEA,

GOT AS MANY TRANSLATIONS OF THE 63-PAGE DOCUMENT AS THEY WANTED .

LEONID BREZHNEV, 56, A SHREWD, SWARTHY METALLURGICAL ENGINEER WHOM

KHRUSHCHEV PLUCKED FROM AN OBSCURE JOB IN THE UKRAINE LITTLE MORE THAN

A DECADE AGO . BREZHNEV WILL NOW PROBABLY GIVE UP THE MERELY CEREMONIAL

FUNCTIONS OF THE SOVIET PRESIDENCY, TAKE OVER AS TASKMASTER OF HEAVY

INDUSTRY AND ARMAMENTS . THE SECOND NEW SECRETARY IS UKRAINIAN PARTY

BOSS NIKOLAI PODGORNY, 60, WHO IS EXPECTED TO TAKE OVER THE SUPERVISION

OF PARTY CADRES . BOTH MEN WERE ALREADY MEMBERS OF THE CENTRAL

COMMITTEE'S INNER SANCTUM, THE PRESIDIUM . NOW, AS SECRETARIES OF THE

COMMITTEE AS WELL, THEY MOVE INTO THE MOST ELITE ECHELON OF THE SOVIET

HIERARCHY . ONLY FOUR OTHER RED LEADERS HOLD SUCH A DOUBLE POSITION,

AND NONE IS KHRUSHCHEV'S LIKELY SUCCESSOR . THE FOUR : FROL KOZLOV,

54, WHO SUFFERED A SEVERE STROKE IN APRIL ; ELDERLY OTTO KUUSINEN, 81

; SENIOR THEORETICIAN MIKHAIL SUSLOV, 60, COMPROMISED BY A STALINIST

ITALY EPITAPH FOR THE APERTURA ITALY LAST WEEK HAD A

PREMIER, BUT NO LEADER, A CABINET, BUT NO EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT, AND A

PARLIAMENT THAT MAY WELL BE DISSOLVED WITHOUT PASSING A SINGLE

SIGNIFICANT LAW . THE NATION FACED THE PROSPECT OF POLITICAL TURMOIL

UNMATCHED SINCE THE COMMUNIST BID FOR POWER WAS TURNED BACK IN 1948 .

SHUT TIGHT WAS THE RISKY APERTURA A SINISTRA (OPENING TO THE LEFT),

WITH NO NEW APERTURA IN SIGHT IN ANY PARTICULAR DIRECTION . BROAD JUMP

. THE LEFT-CENTER OPENING WAS CREATED 17 MONTHS AGO BY LEFTWING

CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS IN ALLIANCE WITH PIETRO NENNI'S SOCIALISTS AND WITH

THE TACIT CONSENT OF THE VATICAN . THE IDEA WAS THAT THIS COALITION

ENACT OVERDUE " REFORMS " IN AGRICULTURE, EDUCATION AND FINANCE,

BACKED BY THE SOCIALISTS BUT OPPOSED BY ITALY'S RIGHT-WING PARTIES . AT

THE SAME TIME, THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS, SOMEWHAT NAIVELY MACHIAVELLIAN,

HOPED TO SEPARATE NENNI FROM HIS LONGTIME COMMUNIST ALLIES . NENNI, A

PRACTICAL POLITICAL JUMPER, SEEMED READY TO LEAP AGAIN . HE HAD BEEN A

PAL OF MUSSOLINI'S WHEN BOTH WERE YOUNG FASCISTS ; HE SOON BROKE WITH

IL DUCE (WHO NEARLY HAD HIM SHOT), FOUGHT AGAINST THE COMMUNISTS UNTIL

THE EARLY '30S, MADE UP WITH THEM AFTER THE WAR, WHEN HE TOOK MOST OF

HIS PARTY INTO THE RED CAMP . (THE REMAINING ANTI-COMMUNIST SOCIALISTS

FORMED ITALY'S SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY UNDER GIUSEPPE SARAGAT.) AFTER

HUNGARY, NENNI AGAIN PARTLY BROKE WITH THE COMMUNISTS . NOW, AT 72, HE

WAS TOYING WITH BOURGEOIS RESPECTABILITY BY COOPERATING WITH THE CENTER

PARTIES BUT HIS OWN FOLLOWERS WERE NOT SO EAGER . THEY MIGHT OWN CARS

OR GO SKIING AT ST . MORITZ, BUT MOST OF THEM STILL HANKERED FOR

ALLIANCE WITH THE COMMUNISTS A FEELING THAT WAS REINFORCED BY MASSIVE

RED GAINS IN THE RECENT NATIONAL ELECTIONS . NENNI MADE A DEAL WITH

PREMIERDESIGNATE ALDO MORO FOR THE SOCIALISTS' 87 VOTES IN THE CHAMBER

OF DEPUTIES . MORO'S CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS WOULD SUPPORT SOCIALIST

DEMANDS FOR 15 NEW REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS, EVEN THOUGH IT MEANT THAT IN

SOME KEY INDUSTRIAL REGIONS SOCIALISTS COULD WIND UP IN JOINT CONTROL

WITH THE COMMUNISTS . NENNI IN TURN PROMISED SUPPORT FOR ITALIAN

PARTICIPATION IN NATO, ALTHOUGH MANY IF NOT MOST OF NENNI'S SOCIALISTS

REALLY WANT A NEUTRALIST ITALY . QUICK SWITCH . MEETING TO RATIFY THE

MORO-NENNI CONTRACT, MEMBERS OF THE SOCIALIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE

TROOPED INTO A BASEMENT HALL OF AN ANCIENT ROMAN VILLA NEAR THE BANK OF

THE TIBER . FROM THE START, THERE WAS TROUBLE . " YOU SAY YOU HAVE AN

AGREEMENT ON REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS, " SHOUTED A HECKLER AT NENNI, " BUT

YOU DON'T SAY WHEN . " HASTILY MOVING ON TO FOREIGN AFFAIRS, NENNI TOLD

HIS GRUMBLING FOLLOWERS THAT " THE ATLANTIC PACT IS ONE OF THE ELEMENTS

UPON WHICH RESTS A TROUBLED PEACE A TROUBLED PEACE, IF YOU LIKE, " HE

ADDED QUICKLY, " BUT ONE WHICH HAS AVOIDED THE OUTBREAK OF WAR .

AT THAT HERESY, THERE WAS OPEN REVOLT

FROM THE PRO-COMMUNIST CARRISTI (LITERALLY " TANK DRIVERS, " A NICKNAME

DERIVED FROM THE RED TANKS THAT CRUSHED THE HUNGARIAN REBELLION) .

ALONE, THEY DID NOT HAVE THE VOTES TO DEFEAT NENNI, BUT NOW LONGTIME NO

. 2 MAN RICCARDO LOMBARDI, EAGERLY EYING THE NO . 1 SPOT, ALSO OPPOSED

NENNI . THE ARGUMENT RAGED FOR 8F HOURS . BY 5 : 30 A.M., NENNI WAS

DEFEATED AND THE ALLIANCE WITH THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS HAD COLLAPSED .

THE OLD MAN SUBMITTED HIS RESIGNATION ON THE SPOT . IT WAS NOT

ACCEPTED, BUT THAT HARDLY MATTERED . TO PRESIDENT ANTONIO SEGNI, MORO

REPORTED THAT, AFTER 24 DAYS OF TRYING, HE WOULD BE UNABLE TO FORM A

NEW LEFTCENTER COALITION . COMMUNIST BOSS PALMIRO TOGLIATTI WAS

JUBILANT OVER THE CHAOS, CALLED FOR A POPULAR FRONT GOVERNMENT . AT THE

SAME TIME HE URGED REDS TO " HARVEST YOUR NEIGHBORS' GARDENS, " WHICH

MEANT WOOING THE DIVIDED, DEMORALIZED SOCIALISTS IN THE WINE SHOPS,

FACTORIES AND FIELDS . LIBERAL LEADER GIOVANNI MALAGODI, WHOSE SMALL,

FREE-ENTERPRISE PARTY DOUBLED ITS SHARE OF THE VOTE (FROM 3.5 PER CENT

TO 7 PER CENT ) IN THE APRIL ELECTIONS, PLEDGED TO OPEN THE EYES OF "

ALL THOSE ITALIANS WHO ARE STILL PRISONERS OF THE MARXIST DREAM,

INCLUDING THOSE WHOM THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS ARE DRAWING INTO SOCIALISM

. " AS A LAST RESORT, SEGNI TURNED OVER THE TASK OF FORMING A NEW

GOVERNMENT TO THE AFFABLE PRESIDENT OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES,

GIOVANNI LEONE, A MIDDLE-OF-THE-ROAD CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT AND THE FIRST

NEAPOLITAN PREMIER . LIKE ANY SON OF NAPLES, LEONE ENJOYS SINGING ;

WITH EX-PREMIER AMINTORE FANFANI AT THE PIANO, HE HAS CROONED

NEAPOLITAN LOVE SONGS TO SUCH VISITING DIGNITARIES AS AVERELL HARRIMAN

AND HAROLD MACMILLAN . SHORT MESSAGE . AFTER ONE DAY, LEONE SUCCEEDED

IN FORMING A GOVERNMENT . IT WAS A MINORITY CABINET OF 22 CHRISTIAN

DEMOCRATS, MOSTLY " TECHNICIANS, " THAT WOULD STAY IN OFFICE AT LEAST

LONG ENOUGH TO APPROVE A NEW BUDGET AND TO GREET PRESIDENT KENNEDY .

AFTER THAT, THE PARLIAMENT WILL RECESS FOR THE SUMMER WHILE CHRISTIAN

DEMOCRATS DEBATE WHETHER TO GAMBLE ON RECOUPING THEIR RECENT LOSSES BY

HOLDING NEW NATIONAL ELECTIONS THIS FALL . SADLY, MORO WROTE AN EPITAPH

FOR THE APERTURA : " THE SOCIALIST PARTY DREW BACK BECAUSE IT CANNOT

CONCEIVE OF A POLITICAL LINE OF ITS OWN THAT DOES NOT ENJOY, DIRECTLY

OR INDIRECTLY, THE APPROVAL OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY . TODAY ONE CANNOT

COUNT UPON THE SOCIALIST PARTY FOR THE SOLUTION OF ITALY'S POLITICAL

PROBLEMS . /

ISRAEL VALE ATQUE AVE IN JERUSALEM, HALO-HAIRED PREMIER DAVID

BEN-GURION, 76, HANDED IN HIS RESIGNATION FOR THE EIGHTH TIME IN HIS 15

YEARS IN OFFICE . ISRAEL WAS NOT UNDULY DISTURBED, SINCE BEN-GURION IS

AS FAMED FOR RESIGNATIONS AS FOR SUCH OTHER IDIOSYNCRASIES AS STANDING

ON HIS HEAD AND ADVOCATING FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH GERMANS . BUT WHAT

STARTLED PEOPLE AND POLITICIANS THIS TIME WAS THE FACT THAT BEN-GURION

ALSO GAVE UP HIS PARLIAMENTARY SEAT IN THE KNESSET, AN ACT THAT WOULD

LEAVE HIM INELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE CABINET OFFICE . ASKED WHY, BENGURION

FIRMLY REPLIED, " PERSONAL NEEDS . I PROPOSE TO KEEP THEM TO MYSELF . "

WEARY CHIEF . IN FACT, BEN-GURION WAS WEARY OF POLITICS AND DISTURBED

BY A RISING GENERATION THAT QUESTIONS HIS LEADERSHIP . HIS MAPAI PARTY

WAS IRREVOCABLY SPLIT BY THE 1960-61 LAVON AFFAIR, WHICH ALSO TANGLED

THE ARMY IN POLITICS. BEN-GURION HAS CONTINUALLY HAD TO ARBITRATE

DISPUTES AND PACIFY ANTAGONISTS . FINALLY, HE HAS NEARLY DESPAIRED OF

REDUCING THE MULTIPLICITY OF PARTIES (15 IN ALL), DESPITE HIS ARGUMENT

THAT " IF THE U.S . WITH HUGE POPULATION CAN GET ALONG WITH TWO

PARTIES, WHY CAN'T WE WITH ONLY 2,000,000 PEOPLE ? " B-G " WAS NOT

TOO WEARY OF POLITICS TO HAND-PICK HIS SUCCESSOR : UKRAINIANBORN

FINANCE MINISTER LEV ESHKOL, 67, WHO HAS BROUGHT ISRAEL FROM A

HAND-TOMOUTH ECONOMY TO THE POINT WHERE ITS GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT HAS

RISEN AN AVERAGE OF 11 PER CENT ANNUALLY OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS, AND

ITS DOLLAR SURPLUS IS ALMOST AN EMBARRASSMENT . TWICE MARRIED BUT NOW A

WIDOWER, ESHKOL HAS FOUR DAUGHTERS, ONE OF WHOM TEACHES DANCING IN

JERUSALEM, WHILE ANOTHER IS A SERGEANT IN THE ISRAELI ARMY . HIS NEW

CABINET STRONGLY RESEMBLES BEN-GURION'S OLD ONE, AND IT IS UNLIKELY

THERE WILL BE ANY RADICAL CHANGES IN FOREIGN OR DOMESTIC POLICY . A FAR

MORE ADAPTABLE MAN THAN BEN-GURION, ESHKOL WILL PROBABLY GOVERN MORE

THROUGH COMPROMISE THAN BY FIAT . PET PROJECT . THE GOVERNMENTAL

TRANSITION MIGHT HAVE BEEN UNEVENTFUL EXCEPT THAT, SURE ENOUGH,

BEN-GURION SUDDENLY WITHDREW HIS RESIGNATION FROM THE KNESSET, ON

CONDITION THAT HE WOULD ONLY ATTEND PARLIAMENTARY SESSIONS IF HE FELT

LIKE IT . NEITHER ESHKOL NOR THE OPPOSITION POLITICIANS WERE TOO HAPPY

ABOUT BEN-GURION'S KEEPING HIS FOOT IN THE DOOR . NOW, SHOULD ESHKOL

FALTER OR A CRISIS THREATEN, BEN-GURION MIGHT CHARGE BACK INTO OFFICE

TO SAVE THE COUNTRY FROM ALLEGED DISASTER . MEANWHILE, BEN-GURION PLANS

TO LIVE AT THE SDE BOKER KIBBUTZ IN THE BLEAK NEGEV DESERT AND TURN OUT

BOOKS ON EVERYTHING FROM JEWISH HISTORY TO HIS OWN AUTOBIOGRAPHY . HE

HOPES ALSO TO FURTHER HIS PET PROJECT : THE " CULTURAL ABSORPTION " OF

JEWISH IMMIGRANTS FROM ASIA AND NORTH AFRICA INTO ISRAEL'S

PREDOMINANTLY WESTERN SOCIETY . BEN-GURION ARGUES THAT UNLESS THE

ORIENTAL JEWS ARE EDUCATED FASTER, ISRAEL MAY TURN INTO A TYPICALLY "

INDOLENT " LEVANTINE STATE WITHIN TEN YEARS .

COMMUNISTS THE PLACE IS BERLIN, THE PROBLEM IS

PEKING ANTICIPATING PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S TUMULTUOUS WEST BERLIN

RECEPTION, NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV HASTILY ARRANGED A TRIP OF HIS OWN . HE

DECIDED TO GO TO EAST BERLIN, OSTENSIBLY TO CELEBRATE THE 70TH BIRTHDAY

OF EAST GERMANY'S SPADEBEARDED COMMUNIST BOSS WALTER ULBRICHT . JUST 48

HOURS AFTER KENNEDY, ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE WALL, HAD CRIED, " I AM A

BERLINER, " KHRUSHCHEV ARRIVED ON THE EAST SIDE, BENT ON SHOWING THAT

HE WAS A BERLINER TOO . BUT THE THIN WELCOMING CROWD WAS NOT EXACTLY

EAGER TO MAKE HIM AN HONORARY CITIZEN . MINUTES BEFORE KHRUSHCHEV'S

TURBOPROP LANDED AT SCHONEFELD AIRPORT, AN ANNOUNCER DRILLED THE

SPECTATORS IN A PROPER GREETING : " NOW, WHEN OUR FRIEND STEPS OUT OF

HIS PLANE, WE WILL ALL CHEER IN UNISON, HIP, HIP, HURRAH . " WHEN

NIKITA STEPPED OUT OF HIS PLANE, ALL SMILES, THE CROWD WAS SILENT AND

ONLY THE HONOR GUARD OF SOLDIERS SHOUTED, OFFICIALLY . IN CONTRAST TO

PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S WELCOME BY MORE THAN A MILLION WEST BERLINERS, A

SCANT 250,000 EAST BERLIN FACTORY WORKERS, SECRETARIES AND

SCHOOLCHILDREN, MARCHING IN CLOSED FORMATIONS, TURNED OUT FOR

KHRUSHCHEV . ALONG PARTS OF THE 16-MILE ROUTE TO THE RED CITY HALL, THE

ONLY SPECTATORS WERE THE VOLKSPOLIZEI . THE REAL REASON FOR

KHRUSHCHEV'S PRESENCE IN EAST BERLIN, OF COURSE, WAS NOT THAT HE WANTED

TO HELP ULBRICHT BLOW OUT THE CANDLES, NOR WAS IT ENTIRELY A MATTER OF

TRYING TO COUNTERACT THE EMOTIONS STIRRED UP BY THE KENNEDY VISIT .

MOST OF ALL, KHRUSHCHEV WANTED TO MEET WITH HIS EAST EUROPEAN SATELLITE

CHIEFS TO CLOSE RANKS BEFORE THE CHINESE ARRIVE IN MOSCOW THIS WEEK TO

CONFER ON THE WORSENING SINO-SOVIET IDEOLOGICAL SPLIT . DISTRIBUTION

PROBLEM . THEIR DISPUTE GREW SO ANGRY LAST WEEK THAT MOSCOW RESORTED TO

EXPELLING CHINESE DIPLOMATS, A TREATMENT HITHERTO RESERVED FOR WESTERN

REPRESENTATIVES . BEHIND THIS LATEST EXPLOSION WAS A 24,000-WORD PEKING

BLAST AT KHRUSHCHEV'S POLICIES, DESIGNED TO SHOW THAT HIS PEACEFUL

COEXISTENCE LINE IS A COWARDLY BETRAYAL OF TRUE RED REVOLUTIONARIES,

THAT HE IS SHILLY-SHALLYING WITH THE " PAPER TIGERS " OF IMPERIALISM,

AND THAT HE IS " SUBVERTING " OTHER COMMUNIST PARTIES . WHEN THE

RUSSIANS REFUSED TO PUBLISH THE PEKING LETTER, ISSUED TWO WEEKS AGO,

THE CHINESE EMBASSY IN MOSCOW STARTED CIRCULATING COPIES, THEREBY

PROVOKING THE KREMLIN TO THROW OUT THREE EMBASSY ATTACHES AND TWO OTHER

CHINESE . PEKING CALLED THE ACTION " UNREASONABLE AND UNTENABLE, "

NOTED THAT IT WAS " UNPRECEDENTED IN THE HISTORY OF THE RELATIONS

BETWEEN OUR TWO SOCIALIST COUNTRIES, " AND ACCUSED MOSCOW OF

DELIBERATELY TRYING TO CREATE OBSTACLES TO THE SCHEDULED TALKS . EVEN

AS KHRUSHCHEV ARRIVED IN EAST BERLIN, THE CHINESE EMBASSY THERE WENT

RIGHT AHEAD DISTRIBUTING COPIES OF THE PEKING MANIFESTO TO INTERESTED

BYSTANDERS .

STALIN'S GHOST . ON

HAND FOR TALKS WITH KHRUSHCHEV IN EAST BERLIN WERE THE SATELLITE CHIEFS

OF POLAND, CZECHOSLOVAKIA, HUNGARY AND BULGARIA . ABSENT, AT LEAST FROM

AMONG EARLY ARRIVALS : RUMANIAN RED BOSS GHEORGHE GHEORGHIUDEJ, WHO IS

NOT ONLY FEUDING WITH MOSCOW OVER ECONOMIC PLANNING BUT IS WARM TOWARD

PEKING, ALLOWED ITS MANIFESTO TO APPEAR IN THE RUMANIAN PRESS . WHAT

CONFRONTED THE SMALL-SCALE RED SUMMIT MEETING WAS THE PICTURE OF THE

SINO-SOVIET RIFT TEARING INTO THE COMMUNIST FABRIC ALL OVER THE WORLD .

IN MOSCOW, A MASSIVE INTERNATIONAL CONVOCATION OF FEMALE COMRADES FOUND

THE RUSSIA-CHINA ISSUE A CAUSE FOR NEARHYSTERIA (SEE FOLLOWING STORY) .

SUCH RED FRONT ORGANIZATIONS AS THE WORLD FEDERATION OF TRADE UNIONS

AND THE WORLD PEACE COUNCIL HAVE ALSO STARTED SQUABBLING OVER THE ISSUE

. IN ASIA, AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA, MANY COMMUNIST PARTIES ARE FEELING

THE SPLIT ; WHERE COMMUNISM HAS PROSPERED BY APPEARING " MODERATE, "

PARTY LEADERS BLUNTLY DENOUNCE RED CHINA AND ARE BEGINNING TO PURGE

PEKING PARTISANS . EVEN IN WESTERN EUROPE'S OVERWHELMINGLY PRO-MOSCOW

PARTIES, SOME YOUNG REDS HAVE RESPONDED TO PEKING'S REVOLUTIONARY ZEAL,

HAVE JOINED RED CHINESE " FRIENDSHIP SOCIETIES . " KHRUSHCHEV HIMSELF

BUSILY COUNTERATTACKED AGAINST THE CHINESE . BEFORE HIS BERLIN TRIP, AT

A CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEETING IN MOSCOW WHOSE CHIEF TASK WAS TO COPE WITH

THE RESTLESSNESS OF RUSSIA'S OWN INTELLECTUALS, KHRUSHCHEV DEALT WITH

THE MORE URGENT PEKING PROBLEM . TYPICALLY, HE INTERPRETED PRESIDENT

KENNEDY'S " STRATEGY OF PEACE " SPEECH AT THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY LAST

MONTH AS A SIGN OF WESTERN WEAKNESS, USED IT AS EVIDENCE THAT HIS

POLICY OF PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE IS PAYING OFF . THE RED CHINESE, SAID

KHRUSHCHEV, ARE REALLY PESSIMISTS IN PURSUING A NOW-OR-NEVER

REVOLUTIONARY DOGMA, BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T BE IN SUCH A DESPERATE HURRY

TO START WARS AND REVOLUTIONS IF THEY REALLY BELIEVED IN THE

LONG-RANGE, INEVITABLE VICTORY OF COMMUNISM . MOREOVER, THEY USE " THE

NATIONAL, RACIAL APPROACH " IN WIDENING THE SCHISM BETWEEN COMMUNISTS .

KHRUSHCHEV ALSO HEATEDLY DEFENDED HIS DESTALINIZATION DRIVE, ATTACKED

MAO TSE-TUNG (WITHOUT NAMING HIM) FOR BUILDING HIS OWN CULT OF

PERSONALITY . SAID KHRUSHCHEV, RAISING HIS FAVORITE GHOST : " WE ARE

AGAINST LEADERS WHO BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN SENT BY GOD, AND THAT

THE PEOPLE ARE A MASS THAT MUST LISTEN ONLY TO THEM AND APPLAUD . THAT

WAS TYPICAL OF STALIN . " AMID THESE EXCHANGES, THE ATMOSPHERE COULD

SCARCELY BE MORE UNPLEASANT FOR THE SCHEDULED SINO-SOVIET ENCOUNTER

THIS WEEK IF INDEED BOTH PARTIES ARE NOT TOO ANGRY TO GO THROUGH WITH

IT . THE SPLIT, WESTERN OBSERVERS WERE CAREFUL TO POINT OUT, WAS STILL

NOT " FINAL AND FORMAL . " BUT AS AN INFORMAL QUARREL, IT SEEMED TO BE

AT LEAST IN THE QUARTER-FINALS .

HER HEAD . " OUR CONGRESS IS A MANIFESTATION OF CHARMING WOMANHOOD,

MOTHERLY WARMTH, MORAL AND PHYSICAL BEAUTY ! " GUSHED LA PASIONARIA,

QUITE A LITTLE OFF THE MARK . ABOVE ALL, THE CONGRESS WAS A

MANIFESTATION OF THE EVER-WIDENING SINOSOVIET SPLIT . ITALIAN FLIGHT .

AS USUAL, THE DISPUTE WAS BETWEEN THE KHRUSHCHEV LINE, WHICH HOLDS THAT

MEANS, AND THE MAO TSE-TUNG LINE, WHICH DEMANDS AN AGGRESSIVE POLICY,

DEMANDED THE WITHDRAWAL OF U.S . " AGGRESSIVE FORCES " FROM SOUTH VIET

NAM, FORMOSA, OKINAWA, AFRICA, LATIN AMERICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST . IN A

SIMPLER PERIOD OF COMMUNIST HISTORY, THIS MIGHT HAVE PASSED ALMOST

UNNOTICED AS THE STANDARD LINE, EAST OR WEST . BUT NOW THERE WAS A

SUDDEN MOVEMENT ON THE FLOOR, AND OUT OF THE HALL STALKED 50 OF THE

FINEST, MOST PEACE-LOVING ITALIAN FEMALES EVER GATHERED IN ONE BUNCH AT

THE KREMLIN . WHAT WAS BOTHERING THEM ? A TRIM ROMAN BLONDE EXPLAINED

: " WE ARE HERE AS WOMEN TO WORK FOR PEACE AND NOT TO ENGAGE IN COLD

WAR POLEMICS . " MORE TO THE POINT, JAPAN'S COMMUNIST PARTY IS ONE OF

THOSE ALIGNED WITH RED CHINA, AND ITALY'S RED LADIES WERE UNMISTAKABLY

SHOWING THEIR SOLIDARITY WITH COMRADE NIKITA IN THE SINO-SOVIET FIGHT .

RED CHINA'S YANG YUN-YU RETURNED THE BALL TO THE SOVIETS BY LASHING THE

U.S . FOR USING NUCLEAR BLACKMAIL " TO ENSLAVE THE WORLD, " ATTACKING

JOHN KENNEDY FOR HIS CUNNING " STRATEGY " TO DIVIDE CHINA AND THE

SOVIET UNION, AND INSISTING THAT THE FOREMOST PROBLEM WAS NOT PEACEFUL

COEXISTENCE BUT MAINTAINING THE ACTIVE STRUGGLE AGAINST IMPERIALISM . "

HOW, " SHE DEMANDED, " CAN THE OPPRESSED COEXIST WITH THEIR OPPRESSORS

? " LOTTE ULBRICHT REPLIED THAT MADAME YANG WAS WAY OFF BASE . NO ONE

WAS DEMANDING THAT OPPRESSED NATIONS LIVE HAPPILY WITH THEIR

OPPRESSORS, SHE SAID, AND ADDED THAT RUSSIA WAS, AS ALWAYS, "

WHOLEHEARTEDLY BEHIND THE REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLES OF COLONIAL PEOPLES .

/ ON THE THIRD DAY, INDIA'S ARUNA ASAF ALI CHARGED CHINA WITH BLOCKING

ALL EFFORTS TO SETTLE THE HIMALAYAN WAR WITH INDIA . OUT OF THEIR SEATS

BOUNCED TWO DIMINUTIVE CHINESE DELEGATES WHO LEGGED IT TO THE PLATFORM

IN SLIT SKIRTS TO DEMAND TIME FOR REBUTTAL, THEIR HEATED WORDS DULY

TRANSLATED BY AN INTERPRETER . A RUSSIAN OFFICIAL FRANTICALLY WRAPPED

HER HANDS AROUND THE MICROPHONE ; BRITISH CHAIRMAN DR . JOAN CARRITT

VAINLY JANGLED A BELL ; PRO-SOVIET DELEGATES ADDED TO THE UPROAR BY

SHOUTING THAT THE CHINESE SHOULD STAND DOWN . MALE WALL . THE ONLY

PEOPLE PAYING ATTENTION TO THE BITTER CHINESE COMPLAINTS WERE A GROUP

OF WESTERN NEWSMEN . THE SIGHT OF OUTSIDERS OVERHEARING THE FAMILY

QUARREL BROUGHT FIERY JEANNETTE VERMEERSCH TO HER FEET AND, POINTING AN

ACCUSING FINGER, SHE CRIED TO THE CHINESE DELEGATES : " YOU ARE

TALKING IN FRONT OF THE IMPERIALIST PRESS AND YET YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE

FIGHTING IMPERIALISM ! " STRONG-ARMED RUSSIAN MALES FORMED A HUMAN

WALL BETWEEN THE REPORTERS AND THE CHINESE AS THE EXASPERATED CHAIRMAN

ADJOURNED THE MEETING . THE ROLE OF PEACEMAKER FELL TO GUINEA'S JEANNE

MARTIN, PRESIDENT OF THE PANAFRICAN WOMEN'S CONFERENCE, WHO GOT THE

CHINESE LADIES OFF THE PLATFORM BY PROMISING THEM A LATER CHANCE TO

SPEAK . DESPITE ALL THOSE IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES, A NON-COMMUNIST MALE

WHO HAS EVER HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH A WOMEN'S ORGANIZATION COULD NOT

ESCAPE THE UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING THAT THE RED LADIES WERE ACTING

SOMEWHAT LIKE ORGANIZATION WOMEN . AT WEEK'S END THE MOOD GREW BEYOND

EVEN PREDICTABLE FEMININE EXCITEMENT . THE CONGRESS WENT INTO SECRET

SESSION, HOPING TO HAMMER OUT ITS DIFFERENCES BEHIND CLOSED DOORS . THE

ATTEMPT FAILED . WHEN THE MAJORITY AGREED ON AN APPEAL FOR PEACE AND

AGAINST THE ARMS RACE, BUT FAILED TO DENOUNCE THE U.S . OR NATO, THE

CHINESE DELEGATES AND THEIR ALBANIAN ALLIES VOTED AGAINST, AND REMAINED

STUBBORNLY SEATED WHILE THE CROWD OF 5,000 JUMPED TO THEIR FEET, WAVED

HANDKERCHIEFS AND CLAPPED RHYTHMICALLY IN A 50-MINUTE DEMONSTRATION .

CHINA'S MADAME YANG THEN MOUNTED THE PODIUM TO EXPLAIN HER VOTE, BUT

WAS DROWNED OUT BY ANGRY SHOUTS AND FINALLY RULED OUT OF ORDER .

GREAT BRITAIN WHILE THE PRISONER SKETCHED IN

JAIL, HE LIVED LIKE THE PRINCE OF PONCES . FOR 56[ A DAY, HE WAS ABLE

UNDER BRITISH PRISON REGULATIONS TO GET A CELL WITH A SOFT BED, A

CARPET ON THE CONCRETE FLOOR, CURTAINS ON THE BARRED WINDOW, AN

ARMCHAIR, AND ANOTHER PRISONER TO CLEAN UP AFTER HIM . DURING THE THREE

WEEKS STEPHEN WARD WAS IN JAIL, JOHN PROFUMO HAD BEEN DISGRACED, EVGENY

IVANOV EXPELLED FROM THE COMMUNIST PARTY AND PACKED OFF TO A RUSSIAN

MENTAL HOSPITAL, AND CHRISTINE KEELER SUCCESSFULLY SCREEN-TESTED FOR

THE PROPOSED " DRAMATIZED DOCUMENTARY " OF HER LIFE . BUT LAST WEEK

ARTIST-OSTEOPATH WARD, THE FOURTH MEMBER OF WHAT LABOR PARTY LEADER

HAROLD WILSON ELOQUENTLY CALLED " THIS DINGY QUADRILATERAL, " AT LAST

HELD CENTER STAGE . HANDCUFFED AND WEARING SUNGLASSES, WARD STUCK HIS

TONGUE OUT AT PHOTOGRAPHERS AS HE WAS LED INTO LONDON'S MARYLEBONE

MAGISTRATES' COURT FOR A HEARING TO DECIDE WHETHER HIS CASE SHOULD BE

REFERRED TO THE OLD BAILEY FOR TRIAL . THE CHARGE : EIGHT COUNTS OF

PROCURING, LIVING OFF THE EARNINGS OF PROSTITUTES, RUNNING A BROTHEL

AND ARRANGING ABORTIONS . IN HIS OPENING STATEMENT, PROSECUTOR MERVYN

GRIFFITH-JONES WARNED THAT THE HEARING WOULD UNFOLD A " SOMEWHAT SORDID

STORY . " IT WAS SORDID ALL RIGHT AND MORE THAN SOMEWHAT . SEE JIM . A

PARADE OF GIRLS TALL, SHORT, BLOND, BRUNETTE, REDHEADED TOOK THE STAND

. BUT, INEVITABLY, THE STAR WITNESSES WERE CHRISTINE KEELER AND MARILYN

( " MANDY " ) RICE-DAVIES . DURING CHRISTINE'S TESTIMONY, WARD QUIETLY

SKETCHED HER FROM THE DOCK . CHRISTINE SAID THAT BETWEEN LOVERS OF HER

OWN, SHE WOULD STAY PLATONICALLY WITH WARD AT HIS WIMPOLE MEWS FLAT . "

WE WERE LIKE BROTHER AND SISTER, " SHE SAID, BUT FRATERNALLY, WARD KEPT

HER SUPPLIED WITH MEN . " MY LIFE USED TO REVOLVE AROUND STEPHEN FROM

THE MOMENT I GOT UP UNTIL THE MOMENT I WENT TO BED, " SHE SAID . " I

THOUGHT I COULD NEVER STAND ON MY FEET UNLESS HE WAS THERE TO SUPPORT

ME MENTALLY . " WARD TOLD HER IT WAS ALL RIGHT FOR A GIRL TO SLEEP WITH

A MAN FOR MONEY AS LONG AS SHE DID NOT GET THE " PROSTITUTE MENTALITY .

/ THOUGH PAYMENT FOR SERVICES RANGED UP TO $140, HALF OF WHICH USUALLY

WENT TO WARD, SHE SAID : " I HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED MYSELF A CALL GIRL

OR PROSTITUTE . " SOMETIMES WHEN WARD " COMPLAINED ABOUT HAVING NO

MONEY, " CHRISTINE TESTIFIED, SHE WOULD SIMPLY SAY : " I'LL GO SEE JIM

. " HE WAS A WEALTHY BUSINESSMAN, WHO HAD PAID HER " HUNDREDS OF

POUNDS, " BUT THE NAME MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN JACK . PROFUMO ALSO GAVE

HER MONEY, " BUT NOT FOR MYSELF ; IT WAS FOR MY MOTHER . " MISS X .

CHRISTINE SAID THAT SHE TOOK UP MODELING SO THAT SHE COULD KEEP MEETING

GIRLS TO INTRODUCE TO WARD . OFTEN WHEN SHE AND WARD WERE OUT WALKING,

/ HE USED TO TELL ME WHICH GIRL HE LIKED IN A SHOP AND SAY " GO AND GET

HER . " ' CHRISTINE WOULD INTRODUCE THE GIRLS TO WARD UNDER THE GUISE

THAT HE WAS HER BROTHER OR THAT HE WANTED TO SKETCH THEM . WARD WOULD

THEN SEDUCE THE GIRLS AND LATER DISCUSS THEIR TALENTS WITH CHRISTINE .

/ HE USED TO SAY " THAT WAS WONDERFUL, " ' SHE SAID . " SHE'S GOOD,

SHE'S NOT BAD, SHE'S FANTASTIC,' SOMETHING LIKE THAT .

WHILE THE

PRISONER SKETCHED ADD AS GRIFFITH-JONES AND HIS WITNESSES TOLD IT, WARD

WAS OCCASIONALLY TURNED DOWN . ONCE A SHOPGIRL BALKED WHEN HE WANTED

HER TO GO TO A PARTY " WHERE SHE WOULD SEE GIRLS TIED UP AND WHIPPED .

/ ANOTHER TIME, WARD TOLD A " YOUNG LADY OF THE UTMOST RESPECTABILITY,

/ SAID THE PROSECUTOR, THAT HE HAD A TWO-WAY MIRROR IN HIS FLAT THROUGH

WHICH ONE COULD SEE INTO THE BEDROOM FROM THE LIVING ROOM, ADDED HE

HOPED TO MAKE MONEY FROM PEOPLE WHO WOULD PAY TO WATCH . TAKING THE

STAND HERSELF LATER, THE GIRL A TALL BRUNETTE WEARING SKI PANTS,

IDENTIFIED ONLY AS A CERTAIN " MISS X " RECALLED TELLING WARD THAT SHE

WAS NOT IN THE LEAST INTERESTED IN WATCHING THAT KIND OF THING . " MY

DARLING, " WARD REPLIED, " I DON'T WANT YOU TO WATCH . I WANT YOU TO

PERFORM . " ALWAYS BILL . PERHAPS THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY THING ABOUT

ALL THIS WAS THE UNLIKELY ASSOCIATION BETWEEN WARD AND HIS ARISTOCRATIC

FRIEND, VISCOUNT ASTOR . CHRISTINE STARTLED THE JAMMED COURTROOM BY

TESTIFYING THAT WHEN SHE AND MANDY WERE ONCE SHARING A FLAT, THEIR RENT

WAS PARTLY PAID BY NONE OTHER THAN ASTOR HIMSELF . SON OF COMBATIVE,

CONVIVIAL NANCY ASTOR, BRITAIN'S FIRST WOMAN M.P., YOUNG ASTOR GREW UP

AT THE CENTER OF BRITAIN'S SOCIAL AND POLITICAL WORLDS . HIS UNCLE IS

PROPRIETOR OF THE LONDON TIMES, HIS BROTHER EDITOR OF THE OBSERVER .

THE " CLIVEDEN SET " WAS FAMED IN THE '30S NOT ONLY FOR ITS APPEASING

POLITICS BUT ITS INTELLECTUAL SPARKLE ; AND CHARMING, GENEROUS BILL

ASTOR TRIED TO CARRY ON THE TRADITION . HIS CELEBRATED PARTIES FREELY

MIXED WRITERS, ARTISTS, POLITICIANS AND ARISTOCRATS . BUT THE

THRICE-MARRIED ASTOR (CURRENTLY TO BRONWEN PUGH, FORMER TOP LONDON

MODEL) WAS NEVER REALLY INTELLECTUALLY ATTUNED TO HIS SOPHISTICATED

CIRCLE, WHICH IS PERHAPS WHY HE ALLOWED WARD TO PENETRATE THE FRINGES

OF THE CLIVEDEN SET AND RENTED HIM A COTTAGE ON THE GROUNDS . THE

WORLDS OF THE ASTORS AND OF WARD FREQUENTLY OVERLAPPED IN THE GARDEN

AND AT THE SWIMMING POOL, WHERE BILL ASTOR OFTEN SEEMED TO HAVE MORE

FUN THAN WITH HIS OWN RESPECTABLE GUESTS . IN HER TESTIMONY, MANDY SAID

THAT SHE HAD SLEPT WITH ASTOR . WARD ALWAYS SAID, MANDY DECLARED, THAT

THOUGH HE DID NOT HAVE ANY MONEY, " WE HAVE ALWAYS GOT BILL, WHO CAN

HELP US . " UNDER CROSSEXAMINATION, MANDY WAS TOLD THAT ASTOR HAD

DENIED HER ALLEGATION . SHE REPLIED QUICKLY : " HE WOULD, WOULDN'T HE

?

IN A LETTER TO THE TIMES, THE

HEAD OF ONE LONDON MODEL SCHOOL PROTESTED AGAINST " THE NEW AND GROSSLY

UNFAIR NEWSPAPER PRACTICE OF CALLING ANY WOMAN A " MODEL' WHO SO

DESCRIBES HERSELF AND SO LIBELING THE PROFESSION . WITH FAR MORE

JUSTIFICATION THAN THE NEWSPAPERS HAVE SHOWN, THE MODEL GIRLS OF THIS

AGENCY ARE NOW REFERRING TO MISS KEELER AS THE " WELLKNOWN JOURNALIST .

NEUER ON SONDAY PERHAPS WHAT THE ENGLAND OF CHRISTINE KEELER AND

STEPHEN WARD NEEDS IS A TOUCH OF OLD SCOTLAND . JUDGING BY THE ARCHAIC

LANGUAGE OF THE SCOTTISH BIGAMY ACT (1551), FEW OFFENDERS ARE MORE

FROWNED UPON THAN " THAME THAT MARYIS TWA SINDRIE WYFIS OR HUSBANDIS

(NEVER AGAIN BEAR) OFFICE OF HONOUR, DIGNITIE NOR BENEFICE . " AS IT

HAPPENS, THIS HARSH TREATMENT HAS NOT BEEN METED OUT FOR MONNY A YEAR

LANG SYNE, BUT THE SCOTS' ANCIENT LAW IS STILL ON THE BOOKS . LAST

WEEK, ALONG WITH 166 OTHER COBWEBBED STATUTES ADOPTED BY THE SCOTTISH

KINGDOM BEFORE IT JOINED ENGLAND IN 1707, THE LAW WAS BEING REPEALED IN

THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT . FOR ALL THEIR MORAL GRANITE, THE SCOTS CLEARLY

HAD THEIR PROBLEMS 1 STATUTE, DESIGNED TO CURB REBELLIOUS YOUTH,

DECREED THAT ANY " SONNE OR DAUGHTER ABOVE AGE OF SEXTEIN YEERS NOT

BEING DISTRACTED (DEMENTED) SHALL BEATE OR CURSE THEIR FATHER OR MOTHER

SHALL BE PUT TO DEATH WITHOUT MERCY . " ON THE OTHER HAND, THE LOSS OF

SOME OF THE OLD LAWS MIGHT BE SAID, FROM A DOUR POINT OF VIEW, TO

CONTRIBUTE TO MODERN DECADENCE . AMONG THEM : REPEAL OF A PROHIBITION

(1579) AGAINST " GAMYNG AND PLAYING, PASSING TO TAVERNIS AND AILHOUSES

AND WILFULL REMANING FRA (AWAY FROM) THE PAROCHE KIRK IN TYME OF

SERMONE OR PRAYERS ON SONDAY .

SWEDEN GENTLEMAN SPY THE TALL, COLDLY HANDSOME SWEDISH AVIATOR

WAS A FAMILIAR FIGURE ON THE WASHINGTON COCKTAIL CIRCUIT . AS SWEDISH

AIR ATTACHE FROM 1952 TO 1957, HE IMPRESSED ONE U.S . AIR FORCE GENERAL

AS " EASY AND OUTGOING, AN EXTRAVERT WHO GOT ALONG VERY WELL . " WEST

POINTERS FOUND HIM " SPOONY " MEANING SUAVE . HE PLAYED A COOL, QUIET

GAME OF GOLF AT THE ARMY-NAVY CLUB, HIS BALDING, WHITE-FRINGED HEAD

BENT OVER HIS PUTTER AS GENERALS AND ADMIRALS CHATTED . HIS

CONVERSATION WAS HARDLY MEMORABLE, EXCEPT THAT HE WORRIED ALOUD AND A

LOT ABOUT RADICALS AND LEFTISTS . WHEN HE WENT HOME, THE U.S .

GOVERNMENT PRESENTED HIM WITH THE CUSTOMARY LEGION OF MERIT FOR HIS "

FURTHERANCE OF AMICABLE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE ROYAL SWEDISH AIR

FORCE AND THE U.S . AIR FORCE . " LAST WEEK, AS COLONEL STIG ERIK

CONSTANS WENNERSTROM, 56, AWAITED TRIAL AS A SOVIET SPY, IT WAS

SUDDENLY CLEAR THAT HIS RELATIONSHIPS HAD BEEN MOST AMICABLE EAST OF

THE IRON CURTAIN . WHAT DAMAGE ? WHEN SWEDISH AGENTS ARRESTED HIM, HE

ADMITTED HE HAD BEEN ON THE SOVIET PAYROLL FOR A FULL 15 YEARS NOT ONLY

AS AN AIR ATTACHE BUT AFTER 1957 AS CHIEF OF THE AIR SECTION IN THE

SWEDISH MINISTRY OF DEFENSE, AND SINCE 1961 AS A FOREIGN MINISTRY

CONSULTANT . THOUGH HE DREW ONLY $9,000 ANNUAL PAY, HE LIVED IN A

$40,000 HOUSE IN STOCKHOLM'S EXCLUSIVE DJURSHOLM DISTRICT, AMONG BANK

DIRECTORS AND DIPLOMATS, ENTERTAINED FREQUENTLY . MONEY WAS A MOTIVE

(HE MAY HAVE EARNED AS MUCH AS $100,000 FOR HIS WORK), BUT ONE

ACQUAINTANCE SAID : " HE MUST HAVE ENJOYED THE DANGEROUS GAME AND

THOUGHT HE WAS INTELLECTUALLY BETTER THAN OTHERS . " WHAT DAMAGE COULD

WENNERSTROM'S GAME HAVE DONE TO THE U.S., NATO, AND HIS OWN COUNTRY ?

THOUGH SWEDEN IS NOT A NATO MEMBER, WENNERSTROM HAD CONTACT WITH DANISH

AND NORWEGIAN MILITARY MEN, PROBABLY KNEW A LOT ABOUT THE NATO DEFENSES

AND WEAPONS . HE ALSO KNEW SWEDISH DEFENSE SITES AND STRENGTHS, HAD

ACCESS TO KEY MOBILIZATION AND COMMUNICATION PLANS . IN WASHINGTON, HE

HAD ACCESS AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO DETAILED INFORMATION ON THE U.S .

ARMY'S HAWK, RADAR-GUIDED ANTIAIRCRAFT MISSILE DESIGNED TO KNOCK DOWN

LOW-FLYING SUPERSONIC PLANES . THE RUSSIANS ARE WORKING HARD TO PERFECT

A DEFENSE AGAINST LOW-LEVEL NUCLEAR ATTACK, AND THE HAWK COULD HELP

THEM . MORE PROOF ? SWEDISH MINISTER OF DEFENSE SVEN ANDERSSON WAS

SUSPICIOUS OF WENNERSTROM FOR TWO YEARS PRIOR TO HIS ARREST, BUT

PREMIER TAGE ERLANDER WAS NOT INFORMED UNTIL AFTER AGENTS HAD PICKED UP

WENNERSTROM ON THE WAY TO HIS OFFICE . AS OPPOSITION CRITICS POUNCED,

ERLANDER WENT ON TELEVISION TO EXPLAIN : " IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE

GOVERNMENT TO BE INFORMED OF EVERY PERSON WHO IS UNDER SUSPICION . WE

NEED MORE PROOF IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY BEFORE WE CAN TAKE ACTION . "

IT SOUNDED LIKE A LAME EXCUSE TO LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES, WHO

DEMANDED A PARLIAMENTARY INVESTIGATION . MEANWHILE, ALWAYS THE

GENTLEMAN, WENNERSTROM REPORTEDLY ASKED HIS ATTORNEY TO SEND BACK HIS

LEGION OF MERIT, CALMLY FACED A PROBABLE LIFE SENTENCE FOR " GROSS

ESPIONAGE .

FRANCE THE - BROTHERHOOD THE GRANDEUR THAT IS GAULLISM HAS

ALWAYS DEFIED SIMPLE EXPLANATION, FOR IT OFTEN SEEMS THAT CHARLES DE

GAULLE, LIKE THE CABOTS, SPEAKS ONLY TO GOD . IN A WITTY NEW BOOK, THE

GAULLISTS RITUAL AND DIRECTORY, FRENCH JOURNALIST PIERRE

VIANSSON-PONTE, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT FOR PRESTIGIOUS LE MONDE,

POKES SKILLFULLY AT THE INNER GAULLIST MYSTERIES . THE MOVEMENT,

VIANSSONPONTE CONCLUDES, " CONSISTS NEITHER OF A DOCTRINE NOR OF AN

ORGANIZATION, BUT SIMPLY OF AN EXPERIENCE LIVED THROUGH . " THE HIGH

MASS, SUNG . THE MOST TELLING EXPERIENCE FOR GAULLISTS IS TO BE IN DE

GAULLE'S PRESENCE, WHICH IS SURROUNDED BY AN INFLEXIBLE LITURGY .

GUARDIAN OF THE " CHRISTIAN MORALITY AND SOCIAL PROPRIETY " OF THE

RITUAL IS MME . DE GAULLE . " SHE CHECKS THE NECKLINES OF THE

MINISTERS' WIVES, " SAYS AUTHOR VIANSSONPONTE, " AND HAS AT VARIOUS

ROAD, TALKS ABOUT THE WEATHER,THE GENERAL . THE GENERAL ASKS ABOUT THE

ROAD,TALKS ABOUT THE WEATHER, HIMSELF . " WITH ITS PLANTED QUESTIONS

AND PREPARED ANSWERS, A DE GAULLE PRESS CONFERENCE IS LIKE " A HIGH

MASS, SUNG . " THE RESIGNATION OF A GAULLIST WHO HAS OUTLIVED HIS

USEFULNESS IS " AN ORDER ; IT IS NOT DISPUTED . " WHAT IS REMARKABLE

ABOUT ALL THIS, SAYS VIANSSON-PONTE, IS THAT ALTHOUGH DE GAULLE HAS

ABSOLUTE POWER, HE DOES NOT ABUSE IT . THAT MAY HELP TO EXPLAIN THE

LOYALTY OF HIS FOLLOWERS, BOUND TOGETHER ONLY BY THEIR PARTICIPATION IN

AT LEAST TWO OF GAULLISM'S THREE GREAT ADVENTURES : THE FREE FRENCH

RESISTANCE ; DE GAULLE'S POSTWAR RASSEMBLEMENT DU PEUPLE FRANCAIS

(R.P.F.) AND ITS ABORTIVE BID FOR POLITICAL POWER ; AND THE FORMATION

OF THE FIFTH REPUBLIC . VIANSSON-PONTE ESTIMATES THAT ONLY 1,500

FRENCHMEN QUALIFY AS REAL GAULLISTS, HAS SELECTED 116 OF THESE FOR

INCLUSION IN HIS DIRECTORY . EVEN IN APOSTASY, HE SAYS, THE GAULLIST "

LINK IS INDESTRUCTIBLE . EXCLUDED, EXILED, IN REBELLION, JACQUES

SOUSTELLE REMAINS A MEMBER OF THE CIRCLE . " BUT IRONICALLY, SUCH

RANKING SPOKESMEN FOR PRESENT-DAY GAULLIST POLICY AS FOREIGN MINISTER

MAURICE COUVE DE MURVILLE AND INFORMATION MINISTER ALAIN PEYREFITTE ARE

EXCLUDED FOR LACKING THE PROPER CREDENTIALS . CROSSING THE DESERT .

VIANSSON-PONTE GIVES EACH GAULLIST A GUIDE MICHELIN SORT OF RATING

DENOTING PAST SERVICES TO GAULLISM AND PRESENT STANDING IN RELATION TO

THE GENERAL . A CROSS OF LORRAINE INDICATES FREE FRANCE, A SUBMACHINE

GUN THE RESISTANCE, AND A STAR THE COMPAGNON DE LA LIBERATION, THE

ELITE ORDER OF FREE FRANCE AND RESISTANCE FIGHTERS . A SMALL OUTHOUSE

(CABINET IN FRENCH) MEANS MEMBERSHIP IN DE GAULLE'S PERSONAL OFFICE

STAFF, A MASK MEANS ESPIONAGE WORK DURING WORLD WAR II . A MOTORCYCLIST

SYMBOLIZES TRIPS TO COLOMBEY TO SEE THE GENERAL, AND A HAND GRENADE

MEMBERSHIP IN THE R.P.F . WHY THE GRENADE SYMBOL ? " BECAUSE THE

R.P.F . AIMED TO BLOW UP THE FOURTH REPUBLIC . " AN OPEN DOOR INDICATES

AUDIENCES WITH DE GAULLE, AND AN EAR TAGS THE MAN WHO HAS BEEN SUMMONED

SLASHED ROSETTE SIGNIFIES FORMER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS), A STOOL A

SENATOR, A STRAIGHT-BACKED CHAIR A DEPUTY, A BENCH A DIGNITARY OF THE

FIFTH REPUBLIC . TWO HOBNAILED BOOTS SIGNIFY MEMBERSHIP IN THE GAULLIST

U.N.R., ONE HOBNAILED BOOT STANDS FOR THE SLIGHTLY LEFTIST BUT GAULLIST

U.D.T., A RUBBER BOOT FOR OTHER GAULLIST MOVEMENTS WHOSE MEMBERS WERE

FORCED TO WADE THROUGH THE GENERAL'S RHETORIC . A MESS KIT MARKS THE

MEN WHO TOOK JOBS UNDER THE FOURTH REPUBLIC ( " I SUPPOSE THEY HAD TO

EAT, " SAID DE GAULLE) . A TANK INDICATES PARTICIPATION IN THE ARMY

HIS ONCE POTENT AND ECONOMICALLY HEALTHY DOMAIN OF KATANGA WAS GOING

GOVERNMENT CUT NORTH KATANGA OUT OF TSHOMBE'S FORMER DOMAIN, LEAVING

HIM ONLY THE SOUTHERN PART . NOW THE GOVERNMENT SUBDIVIDED THE AREA

FURTHER, INTO THE PROVINCES OF EAST KATANGA AND LUALABA (SEE MAP) . THE

PURPOSE OF THE GERRYMANDER IS TO REMOVE ANY POWER BASE TO WHICH TSHOMBE

MIGHT RETURN . PREMIER CYRILLE ADOULA AND OTHER CENTRAL-GOVERNMENT

ATTEMPT IN KATANGA ONCE U.N . TROOPS PULL OUT OF THE CONGO . A PERSONAL

CAMPAIGN AGAINST TSHOMBE BEGAN LAST MAY WHEN HIS BODYGUARD WAS FORCIBLY

FOR OFFICE IN EAST KATANGA . BUT SINCE MUCH OF TSHOMBE'S POLITICAL

STRENGTH LIES WITH THE LUANDA TRIBE, NOW ISOLATED IN THE NEW LUALABA

JAPAN FROM THE COW-WALK TO THE BRAWL EVER SINCE ITS FOUNDING 73

YEARS AGO, THE JAPANESE DIET HAS HAD A HARD TIME DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN

ROBERT'S RULES OF ORDER AND THOSE OF THE MARQUIS OF QUEENSBERRY . JUST

AS THE TYPHOONS COME TO JAPAN IN SEPTEMBER, AND THE CHERRY BLOSSOMS IN

APRIL, THE PARLIAMENTARY BRAWLING SEASON ARRIVES IN JUNE, FILLING THE

DIET WITH THE SOUND OF CRASHING FISTS AND STRANGLED CURSES . THIS YEAR

THE SEASON ARRIVED ON SCHEDULE . MORE THAN SECRETARIES . BEFORE WORLD

WAR II, BRAWLING WAS A COMMON PRACTICE AMONG HOT-BLOODED DELEGATES WHO,

IN THE SAMURAI TRADITION, WERE REALLY HANKERING FOR MEDIEVAL DAYS WHEN

POLITICAL DIFFERENCES WERE SETTLED WITH THE SWORD . THROUGHOUT THE DIET

BUILDING, THE MAJOR CONSERVATIVE PARTIES STATIONED FLYING SQUADS OF

YOUNG TOUGHS, KNOWN IRONICALLY AS INGAIDAN (LOBBYISTS), ALWAYS READY

FOR HECKLING OR FIGHTING . DURING THE POSTWAR YEARS, THE U.S . TRIED TO

ENFORCE GOOD BEHAVIOR, BUT THE QUIET SPELL ENDED WITH THE LIFTING OF

THE OCCUPATION . THOUGH THE INGAIDAN WERE GONE, DIET MEMBERS HIRED

HEAVY-FISTED BRAWLERS AS " SECRETARIES . " A BIG RIOT IN JUNE 1954

INJURED SOME 50 PERSONS, FORCED LIBERAL PREMIER SHIGERU YOSHIDA TO

CANCEL A LONG-PLANNED TRIP TO THE U.S . AND APOLOGIZE TO THE EMPEROR .

SURVIVORS OF THAT FIGHT RECALL THE ARRIVAL OF AN OPPOSITION LEADER,

BUKICHI ( " BIG BADGER " ) MIKI, WHO VEHEMENTLY OBJECTED TO WESTERN

DRESS AND ALWAYS WORE A KIMONO . HE SHOWED UP FOR THE FIGHT DRESSED IN

ARMY FATIGUES AND COMBAT BOOTS, EXPLAINED TO COLLEAGUES THAT " YOU

CAN'T KICK WITH A KIMONO ON, YOU KNOW . " SINCE THEN, JAPAN'S EMERGENT

SOCIALISTS HAVE INTRODUCED A WHOLE NEW ARRAY OF TECHNIQUES, MANY MORE

OR LESS NONVIOLENT . THE MOST POPULAR IS USHI ARUKI, OR COW-WALKING .

REALIZING THAT THEY CANNOT BLOCK THE OVERWHELMING CONSERVATIVE

MAJORITY, THE SOCIALISTS DO THEIR BEST TO SLOW BUSINESS TO A STANDSTILL

. IN BALLOTING SESSIONS, EACH SOCIALIST MEMBER GETS UP SLOWLY AS HIS

NAME IS CALLED, SHUFFLES TOWARD THE ROSTRUM WITH THE SHORTEST STEPS

POSSIBLE . WHERE IT TAKES 230 CONSERVATIVES ONLY 15 MINUTES TO VOTE,

120 SOCIALISTS CONSUME AS MUCH AS AN HOUR AND A HALF . COW-WALKING IS

COMBINED WITH SITDOWN STRIKES IN DIET CORRIDORS, DELIBERATE TRAFFIC

JAMS, BOYCOTTS, AND PICKETING TO PREVENT THE SPEAKER FROM TAKING HIS

SEAT . THROUGH THESE TACTICS, THE SOCIALISTS FORCE ALLNIGHT SESSIONS,

HOPING THAT THE WORNOUT GOVERNMENT MEN WILL HAVE TO GIVE IN SOMEWHERE

ALONG THE LINE . NOT ENOUGH BODIES . THIS YEAR, WITH A BACKLOG OF 66

BILLS STILL STALLED IN COMMITTEE, PREMIER IKEDA ORDERED HIS MEN TO PUSH

THEM THROUGH BEFORE THE DIET SESSION CLOSES JULY 6 . WHEN THE

GOVERNMENT PARTY RECENTLY USED ITS MAJORITY TO FORCE A VOTE ON A

CONTROVERSIAL RELIEF-LAW REVISION, COW-WALKING WAS NO LONGER ENOUGH .

FISTS AND ASHTRAYS STARTED TO FLY . BATTLING LAWMAKERS SHOUTED : "

RESPECT PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURES ! " THE BRAWLING LATER SPREAD TO THE

CABINET COMMITTEE, WHERE FIVE BILLS WERE STALLED . SOCIALISTS MASSED

AROUND THE COMMITTEEROOM DOOR TO PREVENT CHAIRMAN TADANORI NAGAYAMA

FROM ENTERING . A FLYING WEDGE OF BURLY CONSERVATIVE " SECRETARIES "

SMASHED THROUGH, CARRYING THE AGING, ANEMIA-WEAKENED CHAIRMAN IN WITH

THEM . AS THE VOTE WAS HURRIEDLY TAKEN, SOCIALISTS SCREAMED " FASCIST

DICTATORSHIP ! " AND CHARGED . IN THE MELEE, CHAIRMAN NAGAYAMA

DISAPPEARED, WAS RESCUED TEN MINUTES LATER BY DIET GUARDS WHO FOUND HIM

BRUISED AND BLEEDING ON THE FLOOR . HE WAS RUSHED TO A HOSPITAL . " WE

WON'T HAVE ENOUGH BODIES TO GO AROUND IF PEOPLE GET INJURED EVERY TIME

A CONTROVERSIAL BILL COMES UP, " SAID YUTARO TAKEYAMA, HEAD OF THE

GOVERNMENT PARTY'S STRATEGY COMMITTEE . " WE WILL JUST HAVE TO APPOINT

. DESPITE SUCH ASSISTANCE, THE NEUTRALIST FORCES UNDER GENERAL KONG LE

HAVE ONLY ONE STRATEGIC POSITION LEFT ON THE PLAIN PHOU THENENG

MOUNTAIN AND ITS FOOTHILLS . LAST WEEK THE COMMUNIST PATHET LAO OPENED

A HEAVY ARTILLERY BARRAGE ON KONG LE'S POSITION . " AT FIRST, THE

COMMUNISTS WERE VERY GOOD TO US AND GAVE US SUPPLIES, " SAYS THE LITTLE

GENERAL . " BUT NOW I KNOW THE PATHET LAO ARE NOT FIGHTING FOR LAOS BUT

FOR COMMUNISM . WE DO NOT WANT LAOS TO BE CONTROLLED BY ANYONE, NOT THE

COMMUNISTS OR THE AMERICANS . " OLD BATTLE SCAR . IN HIS OLIVE-DRAB

HEADQUARTERS TENT ON THE PLAIN OF JARS, WEARING A T SHIRT, A PAIR OF

LEVI'S AND RUBBER BATH SHOES, KONG LE PERCHES ON A STOOL MOROSELY

STUDYING A MAP BENEATH THE LIGHT OF A SWAYING HURRICANE LAMP . THE

PICTURE IS DISCOURAGING : THE PATHET LAO ARE ADVANCING IN THE VANG

VIENG AREA, 13 NEUTRALIST SOLDIERS ARE MISSING AFTER AN ACTION AT BAN

BOUA, A 100-TRUCK RED SUPPLY CONVOY FROM NORTH VIET NAM ARRIVED AT THE

PATHET LAO HEADQUARTERS AT KHANG KHAY . AT SUCH NEWS, KONG LE IS APT TO

WINCE, RUB AN OLD BATTLE SCAR ON HIS FOREHEAD AND SAY : " MY HEAD

HURTS . " THEN HE USUALLY TAKES SOME PILLS, AND A BODYGUARD TREATS HIS

SHOULDER WITH VICKS OINTMENT . WHILE THE NEUTRALISTS ARE INCREASINGLY "

NEUTRAL " AGAINST THE REDS, PREMIER SOUVANNA PHOUMA CONTINUES TO INSIST

ON A DEFENSIVE WAR, IS RELUCTANT TO TAKE THE INITIATIVE . " WHAT CAN I

DO ? " MUSES KONG LE DESPONDENTLY . " THE PREMIER IS ALWAYS TELLING

ME I MUST NOT ATTACK . IT IS VERY DIFFICULT . " LOCKED BRIEFCASES .

KONG LE IS A MAGNET FOR SOME OF THE MOST IDEALISTIC MEN IN LAOS . SHORT

(5 FT . 1 IN., 115 LBS.), QUIET AND GOOD-NATURED, HE NEITHER DRINKS,

SMOKES NOR GAMBLES AND IS FANATIC ABOUT HEALTH, HONESTY AND CLEANLINESS

. HE SHARES COMMON LAOTIAN SUPERSTITIONS, SUCH AS WEARING A " MAGIC "

RING AND A WRIST AMULET TO PLACATE THE PHI (SPIRITS, EVIL OR OTHERWISE)

. WITHOUT PERSONAL AMBITION, KONG LE SAYS THAT " WHEN LAOS IS FREE, "

HE WILL GO HOME TO HIS VILLAGE AND BECOME A FARMER . IN THE FIELD, HE

SHARES HIS TENT WITH THREE OFFICERS AND FOUR ENLISTED MEN . THEY MESS

TOGETHER AROUND A CAMPFIRE, SING SAD LAOTIAN SONGS OR DANCE THE

GRACEFUL LAMVONG, WHILE KONG LE, HOLDING TWO PET HAMSTERS IN HIS LAP,

LOOKS ON . HIS POSSESSIONS ARE FEW : A DESK, A FOOTLOCKER, A

TRANSISTOR RADIO (GIFT FROM THE U.S . AMBASSADOR), AND FIVE LOCKED

BRIEFCASES, WHICH HE KEEPS UNDER HIS BUNK . OCCASIONALLY HE UNLOCKS ONE

TO TAKE OUT NOT CONFIDENTIAL PAPERS BUT A HANDKERCHIEF AND A PAIR OF

SOCKS, AND THEN CAREFULLY RELOCKS IT . WHILE ADMITTING HIS LEADERSHIP

QUALITIES, WESTERN OBSERVERS ARE OFTEN DEPRESSED BY KONG LE'S LAOTIAN

INDIFFERENCE TO DISCIPLINE AND LOGISTICS . ALTHOUGH SUPPLIES ARE

AIRLIFTED TO THE NEUTRALISTS BY FIVE U.S.-LOANED C-46S FROM VIENTIANE,

TRUCKS AND JEEPS BREAK DOWN FOR LACK OF PARTS . AMMUNITION DUMPS ARE

LEFT UNGUARDED AND OPEN TO WEATHER . NEUTRALIST OFFICERS TALK TO EACH

OTHER " IN THE CLEAR " ON FIELD RADIOS, LEAVE MARKED MAPS LYING AROUND,

AND DRIVE AT NIGHT WITH HEADLIGHTS BLAZING . THE SUPPLY SYSTEM IS SO

HAPHAZARD THAT OFTEN ONE UNIT OVERFLOWS WITH RICE RATIONS BUT LACKS

BULLETS, WHILE ANOTHER IS LOADED WITH MUNITIONS BUT STARVES . NONE OF

THE NEUTRALIST TROOPS HAVE BEEN PAID IN ALMOST A YEAR . SAYS KONG LE :

/ MY MEN ARE TIRED, BUT THEIR MORALE IS HIGH, AND THEY STILL HAVE THE

WILL TO FIGHT . " LONG SILENCE . THEY DEMONSTRATED THAT WILL, IN A

LAOTIAN WAY, JUST TWO RIDGES BEYOND KONG LE'S HEADQUARTERS . OVER THE

VELVETY LANDSCAPE AND THROUGH SOFT SUMMER RAIN ROLLED TWO TANKS AND AN

ARMORED CAR CROWDED WITH NEUTRALIST SOLDIERS . THEIR OBJECTIVE WAS A

PATHET LAO ARTILLERY EMPLACEMENT ON TOP OF A STEEP, CONICAL HILL . AS

THE TANKS CHUGGED UP THE FIRST RISE, A HERD OF WILD PONIES STAMPEDED

AWAY FROM THEM . ONE TANK AND THE ARMORED CAR SOON HALTED, BUT THE

SECOND TANK LABORED UPWARD, FOLLOWED BY A SKIRMISH LINE OF SCRAMBLING

SOLDIERS . MOMENTS LATER, THE PATHET LAO GUN FLASHED, AND THE TANK

FIRED BACK . BOTH MISSED . IT SOON BECAME EVIDENT THAT THE COMMUNIST

GUN COULD NOT BE DEPRESSED SUFFICIENTLY TO GET THE TANK IN ITS SIGHTS .

EVEN SO, BOTH SIDES FIRED FUTILELY FOR TWO HOURS . THEN THE TANK

RUMBLED AROUND A SIDE OF THE HILL, AND THE NEUTRALIST SOLDIERS VANISHED

AMONG THE TREES . A LONG SILENCE FOLLOWED . THE PALE SUN SHONE THROUGH

SHOWERS, AND A

RAINBOW BRIEFLY APPEARED OVER THE PURPLE

MOUNTAINS . TWO OF THE WILD PONIES RETURNED

AND BEGAN GRAZING . THE BATTLE SIMPLY

BLURRED INTO THE GENERAL DRIFT OF EVENTS IN LAOS .

SOUTH VIET NAM THE HEART OF QUANG DUC HEADS BOWED, PALMS PRESSED

TOGETHER IN PRAYER, THOUSANDS OF BUDDHISTS FILED QUIETLY THROUGH

SAIGON'S XA LOI PAGODA LAST WEEK TO WITNESS WHAT MOST OF THEM BELIEVED

TO BE A MIRACLE . AMID THE FRAGRANCE OF INCENSE-BURNING REEDS,

YELLOWROBED PRIESTS CHANTED FROM SUNRISE TO MIDNIGHT, LAYMEN GAZED IN

AWE, AND WEEPING WOMEN HELD CHILDREN UP TO SEE IT ALL . ON THE ALTAR,

INSIDE A CRYSTAL URN, WHICH IN TURN WAS ENCASED IN A BOUQUETFLANKED

GLASS CHEST, LAY THE OBJECT OF THEIR REVERENCE A CHARRED PIECE OF FLESH

. UNDER IT A HAND-LETTERED SIGN ANNOUNCED : " THE ETERNAL HEAT OF HIGH

PRIEST QUANG DUC . " TWO WEEKS EARLIER, TO DRAMATIZE THE BUDDHIST

MAJORITY'S FIGHT FOR GREATER RELIGIOUS FREEDOM UNDER SOUTH VIET NAM'S

ROMAN CATHOLIC PRESIDENT NGO DINH DIEM, A 73-YEAR-OLD BUDDHIST MONK

NAMED THICH QUANG DUC HAD SPECTACULARLY SET HIMSELF AFIRE IN A SAIGON

STREET . LATER THE MARTYR'S SCORCHED REMAINS WERE ASSIGNED TO FINAL

CREMATION IN A RICE FIELD OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL . BUT, AS THE PRIESTS

TOLD IT, WHEN THE OLD MAN'S ASHES WERE REMOVED FROM THE OVEN, HIS HEART

EMERGED MIRACULOUSLY UNDESTROYED OBVIOUSLY THE SUPERNATURAL WORK OF

BUDDHA . IMMEDIATELY, HIS FELLOW MONKS PROCLAIMED QUANG DUC A SAINT .

SKEPTICS SUGGESTED THE QUANG DUC'S HEART HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM THE BODY

BEFORE CREMATION, OR HAD BEEN INJECTED WITH A FIRE-RESISTING FLUID .

CERTAINLY THE PHENOMENON WAS FAR FROM ORIGINAL ; DOWN THROUGH THE

AGES, IN LEGEND AND FACT, THE HEARTS OF HEROIC FIGURES HAVE MORE THAN

ONCE WITHSTOOD THE FLAMES. BUT THE " MIRACLE " SERVES THE BUDDHISTS IN

THEIR TWO-MONTH-OLD WAR WITH DIEM . THANKS PARTLY TO PRESSURE FROM THE

U.S., WHICH FEARS THAT MASSIVE BUDDHIST DISAFFECTION COULD WRECK SOUTH

VIET NAM'S LONG, VITAL CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE COMMUNISTS, THE DIEM

GOVERNMENT SIGNED A COMPROMISE AGREEING TO LET THE BUDDHISTS FLY THEIR

OWN FLAG AND PROMISING TO EASE ANTI-BUDDHIST DISCRIMINATION E REGIME

FAILS TO SHOW GOOD FAITH, THE BUDDHISTS VOW, THEY WILL START NEW

DEMONSTRATIONS AND THEY ARE COUNTING ON THE SYMBOL OF QUANG DUC'S

DURABLE HEART TO HELP KEEP THE FAITHFUL INSPIRED .

WHEN GAUTAMA BUDDHA'S BODY WAS

CREMATED, TRADITION HAS IT, SOME PARTS OF IT FAILED TO BURN . JOAN OF

ARC'S HEART IS SAID TO HAVE SURVIVED HER BURNING AT THE STAKE AND BEEN

THROWN INTO THE SEINE . WHEN PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY DROWNED OFF ITALY IN

1822, THREE LITERARY FRIENDS LORD BYRON, EDWARD JOHN TRELAWNY AND LEIGH

COMMUNISTS THE CONFRONTATION A TROUPE OF PATAGONIAN JUGGLERS

WOULD HAVE RECEIVED A WARMER WELCOME FROM THE KREMLIN . NOT A SINGLE

SOVIET REPORTER OR PHOTOGRAPHER WAS ON HAND WHEN THE MEN FROM PEKING

APPEARED AT MOSCOW AIRPORT ; PRAVDA DID NOT EVEN MENTION THEIR ARRIVAL.

 AFTER MONTHS OF INVECTIVE, ACCUSATIONS AND COUNTERACCUSATIONS, THE

GREAT CONFRONTATION BETWEEN SOVIET AND CHINESE PARTY DELEGATIONS WAS

FINALLY AT HAND . EAST AND WEST WATCHED THE SHOWDOWN OR WHAT COULD BE

SEEN OF IT WITH EQUAL FASCINATION .  ALTHOUGH NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV SUDDENLY

DISCOVERED URGENT BUSINESS IN KIEV, THE KREMLIN WAS STIFFLY CORRECT

ABOUT IT ALL, SENT OUT ITS CHIEF DIALECTICIAN, LANKY, AUSTERE MIKHAIL

SUSLOV, TO MEET THE VISITORS . HEAD OF PEKING'S SEVEN-MAN MISSION :

TENG HSIAO-PING, SECRETARYGENERAL OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY . AS

TENG STEPPED OUT OF A SOVIET TU-104 JET, A CROWD OF CHINESE RESIDENTS

IN MOSCOW, WATCHED CLOSELY BY A CHINESE ARMY COLONEL, SENT UP A CHEER .

SUSLOV SMILED, STEPPED FORWARD AND SHOOK TENG'S HAND . BUT THE RUSSIAN

OMITTED THE USUAL BRIEF WELCOMING ADDRESS, INSTEAD POLITELY SUGGESTED

THAT TENG MIGHT LIKE A TWO-HOUR REST BEFORE GETTING DOWN TO BUSINESS .

WHEN A CHINESE DELEGATE REMARKED ON THE CHILLY 57O TEMPERATURE, A

MUSCOVITE RED REPLIED : " WE HOPE IT WILL GET WARMER . " FRESH INSULTS.

IN ONE SENSE, THINGS UNDOUBTEDLY GOT WARMER WHEN BOTH SIDES MET

BEHIND THE MASSIVE WALLS OF A RARELY USED MANSION IN THE LENIN HILLS

SECTION OF MOSCOW . SUSLOV AND TENG EXCHANGED TOASTS, BUT THAT WAS JUST

ROUTINE . FOR UNDER THE POSE OF POLITENESS, THE SINO-SOVIET QUARREL WAS

BECOMING RUDER THAN EVER . WITHOUT EXPLANATION, PEKING SUDDENLY

WITHDREW ITS TWO ENTRIES FROM AN INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL ABOUT TO

OPEN IN MOSCOW . AND JUST BEFORE THE PARTY LEADERS MET, KHRUSHCHEV AND

MAO TSE-TUNG EXCHANGED A FRESH ROUND OF INSULTS OVER RED CHINA'S

25-POINT DENUNCIATION OF SOVIET POLICY . ALTHOUGH THE SOVIETS

THEMSELVES REFUSED TO PUBLISH IT, MOSCOW COMPLAINED LAST WEEK THAT

CHINESE AGENTS HANDED OUT THE DOCUMENT IN CITIES FROM ODESSA TO

LENINGRAD AND EVEN IN THE ATOMIC RESEARCH CENTER OF DUBNA, NEAR MOSCOW.

CHINESE CREWS ON THE PEKING-MOSCOW EXPRESS SCATTERED BUNDLES OF THE

MANIFESTO THROUGH COACH WINDOWS, USED THE TRAIN'S PUBLIC-ADDRESS SYSTEM

TO READ THE CHINESE CHARGES TO THE CAPTIVE SOVIET AUDIENCE . AFTER

MOSCOW EXPELLED THREE CHINESE DIPLOMATS FOR HAVING A HAND IN THIS

EXTRAORDINARY CIRCULATION CAMPAIGN, PEKING OSTENTATIOUSLY WELCOMED THEM

HOME WITH BOUQUETS OF FLOWERS . AT THE SAME TIME, THE CHINESE CONDEMNED

THE SOVIET MOVE AS A VIOLATION OF ITS RIGHT, AS A GOVERNMENT, TO

CIRCULATE STATEMENTS ABROAD . NONSENSE, REPLIED THE SOVIETS . WHAT GAVE

THE CHINESE THE IDEA THAT THEY COULD " BEHAVE AS THOUGH THEY WERE IN

ONE OF THE PROVINCES OF CHINA ? " SUCH TACTICS, FUMED THE KREMLIN,

WERE PLAINLY A VIOLATION OF SOVIET SOVEREIGNTY : " IT IS OBVIOUS THAT

INSTEAD OF SEARCHING FOR WAYS TO A RAPPROCHEMENT, THE CHINESE

LEADERSHIP AIMS AT AGGRAVATING DIFFERENCES . " EQUALLY MATCHED . IF

THAT WAS PEKING'S PURPOSE, IT COULD FIND NO BETTER MAN THAN TENG .

SHORT, STOCKY, IN HIS 60S, TENG WAS BELIEVED BADLY CRIPPLED IN THE

CHINESE CIVIL WAR, STILL HAS A LIMP AND A NERVOUS TIC WHEN HE SPEAKS

WHICH DOES NOT KEEP HIM FROM SPEAKING OFTEN AND ABRASIVELY . NO

STRANGER TO THE RUSSIANS, HE ATTENDED TWO PREVIOUS MOSCOW MEETINGS ON

THE SPLIT IN 1957 AND IN 1960 . A VETERAN OF MAO'S LONG MARCH TO YENAN

IN THE 1930S, TENG CAME TO PROMINENCE AS A POLITICAL COMMISSAR IN THE

ARMY, SINCE 1952 HAS RISEN TO A PLACE AMONG THE TOP FOUR OR FIVE MEN IN

RED CHINA'S HIERARCHY . IN PRESTIGE AND PERSONALITY HE IS A MATCH FOR

SUSLOV, 60, WHO FOR YEARS WAS STALIN'S IDEOLOGICAL MOUTHPIECE, AND NOW

SUPPLIES KHRUSHCHEV WITH THE THEORETICAL JUSTIFICATIONS FOR POLITICAL

STRATEGY . INEVITABLY, WESTERN DIPLOMATS SPECULATED WHETHER THE RED

CHINESE AND THE SOVIETS WOULD SEVER PARTY CONNECTIONS OR DIPLOMATIC

RELATIONS, CARRY THE FEUD TO A SUMMIT SESSION OF WORLD COMMUNIST

LEADERS, OR MERELY AGREE TO CONTINUE TO BE DISAGREEABLE . WHATEVER

HAPPENED, THE GRAVEST SCHISM IN THE HISTORY OF COMMUNISM WAS AT HAND .

*TEXT 365 07/12/63 PAGE 024

WHAT THEY

ARE FIGHTING ABOUT

AT ITS SIMPLEST,

THE RUSSIAN-CHINESE QUARREL IS OVER WHAT STRATEGY TO FOLLOW TOWARD THE

ULTIMATE VICTORY OF COMMUNISM AND OVER WHO SHALL BE IN CHARGE OF

OPERATIONS . BUT BENEATH THIS THERE LIES A FAR DEEPER SPLIT : THE

SPLIT BETWEEN COMMUNIST THEORY AND HUMAN REALITY . EVER SINCE KARL MARX

PREDICTED THAT THE REVOLUTION WOULD BREAK OUT IN INDUSTRIALLY ADVANCED

WESTERN EUROPE, WHILE IT ACTUALLY CAME IN BACKWARD, AGRICULTURAL

RUSSIA, SUCH CONTRADICTIONS HAVE HAUNTED COMMUNISM . TODAY, ACCORDING

TO MARXIST THEORY, CAPITALISM SHOULD BE IN ITS DEATH THROES, THE

WORKING CLASS IN UTTER MISERY, AND THE FORMER COLONIAL PEOPLES WELL ON

THE ROAD TO COMMUNISM . INSTEAD, CAPITALISM IS THRIVING, WESTERN

WORKERS ARE GOING MIDDLE-CLASS, AND THE EX-COLONIES TEND TOWARD

SOCIALISM BUT HARDLY TOWARD COMMUNISM . NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV FAVORS

CHANGING THE THEORY TO FIT THESE FACTS MORE CLOSELY ; HE IS, AS PEKING

ACCURATELY CHARGES, A REVISIONIST . MAO TSE-TUNG FAVORS CHANGING THE

FACTS TO FIT THE THEORY ; HE IS, AS MOSCOW SAYS, A DOGMATIST . BUT

BOTH ARE ALSO REALISTS, MOTIVATED BY DIFFERENT NATIONAL INTERESTS,

DIFFERENT ECONOMIES, AND DIFFERENT HISTORIES . KHRUSHCHEV, THE RULER OF

A NATION THAT HAS AT LAST BEGUN TO GAIN SOME MATERIAL REWARDS, ARGUES

THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN WAR OR REVOLUTION BUT IN PEACEFUL

PROSPERITY, AND THAT ROCKETRATTLING WILL ONLY DRIVE MILLIONS AWAY FROM

COMMUNISM . MAO, RULER OF A COUNTRY WITH A LOT LESS TO LOSE, MASTER OF

A PEASANTRY WHOSE APPETITES DEMAND A BOWL OF RICE, NOT A TV SET OR A

CAR, REPLIES IN EFFECT THAT HE IS NOT RUNNING A POPULARITY CONTEST WITH

THE WEST . POWER CANNOT BE WON BY WOOING ADHERENTS BUT BY FIGHTING FOR

IT OTHERWISE COMMUNISM WILL ATROPHY . FROM THE GOLDEN HORDE TO YENAN

MARXISM PRETENDS THAT IT RAISES PEOPLE ABOVE RACE AND NATION, BUT

MOSCOW AND PEKING ARE DIVIDED BY RACIAL HOSTILITY AND MEMORIES OF

CONFLICT, WHICH WOULD PERSIST EVEN IF IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES COULD BE

IRONED OUT . RUSSIA HAS NEVER FORGOTTEN THE GOLDEN HORDE OF GENGHIS

KHAN, WHICH SWEPT WEST FROM MONGOLIA IN THE 13TH CENTURY, CONSCRIPTING

VOLGA BOATMEN INTO THE KHAN'S ARMY AND FORCING LOCAL PRINCES TO KOWTOW.

WHEN, AFTER 200 YEARS, THE MONGOL EMPIRE COLLAPSED, THE NEWLY UNITED

RUSSIANS LOST NO TIME IN GETTING EVEN . " WEHRE IS CHINA ? " ASKED

CZAR MIKHAIL ROMANOV . " IS IT RICH ? WHAT CAN WE LAY CLAIM TO ? "

RUSSIAN CLAIMS (MANCHURIA, OUTER MONGOLIA, SINKIANG) CAUSED FRICTION

FOR CENTURIES, DOWN TO THE PRESENT . AS LATE AS 1949, WHEN THE CHINESE

REDS HAD VIRTUALLY CONQUERED THE MAINLAND FROM THE NATIONALISTS, MOSCOW

WAS STILL DICKERING FOR TERRITORIAL CONCESSIONS . THE CHINESE STILL

SNEER AT THE RUSSIANS AS " BIG NOSES " AND CONSIDER THEM AS ALIEN AS

OTHER WESTERNERS . MOREOVER, THE POPULATION PRESSURE ALONG THE

SINO-SOVIET BORDER IS A CONSTANT MENACE TO MOSCOW ; BY 1980 THERE WILL

BE 1 BILLION CHINESE . WHEN A BRITISH VISITOR SUGGESTED TO KHRUSHCHEV

NOT LONG AGO THAT THE CHINESE MASSES WOULD EVENTUALLY EXPLODE NORTH

INTO SIBERIA OR SOUTH TO AUSTRALIA, NIKITA REPLIED GRIMLY : " I'M IN

FAVOR OF AUSTRALIA . " FROM THE START, RUSSIAN NATIONAL INTERESTS ALSO

SHAPED MOSCOW'S ATTITUDE TOWARD THE CHINESE COMMUNISTS . IN THE 1920S,

STALIN RUTHLESSLY SACRIFICED MAO'S COMMUNIST MOVEMENT TO CHIANG

KAISHEK, WHOM HE SUPPORTED BECAUSE HE CONSIDERED HIM A STRONG SOVIET

ALLY WHO WOULD FIGHT BOTH WESTERN AND JAPANESE THREATS TO RUSSIAN POWER.

DECIMATED BY CHIANG, THE RAGGED CHINESE COMMUNISTS SURVIVED IN THE

CAVES OF YENAN AND EVENTUALLY WENT ON TO CONQUER CHINA, DESPITE

STALIN'S WARNING THAT THEY WERE BACKWARD AND NOT READY FOR REVOLUTION .

AFTER THE WAR, STALIN SENT MAO A RUSSIAN HANDBOOK OF PARTISAN STRATEGY

AGAINST THE NAZIS ; MAO PASSED IT TO AN AIDE WHO SNORTED : " IF WE

HAD THIS AS OUR TEXTBOOK WE WOULD HAVE BEEN ANNIHILATED TEN YEARS AGO .

THUS MAO WAS BEHOLDEN

NO ONE, LEAST OF ALL STALIN, FOR HIS VICTORY . YET IRONICALLY, THE

FIRST OPEN IDEOLOGICAL CRACK IN THE MOSCOW-PEKING PARTNERSHIP CAME OVER

KHRUSHCHEV'S 1956 DENUNCIATION OF STALIN . FROM " SECRET SPEECH " TO

SPUTNIK MAO HAD SENT A MESSAGE TO THE 20TH PARTY CONGRESS LAVISHLY

PRAISING THE DEAD DICTATOR . WITHOUT BOTHERING TO CONSULT THE CHINESE,

KHRUSHCHEV DELIVERED HIS FAMED " SECRET SPEECH " TO THE CONGRESS, IN

WHICH HE SUDDENLY UNMASKED STALIN AS A MEGALOMANICAL TYRANT . PEKING

WAS STUNNED . MAO FELT CORRECTLY, AS WAS PROVED A FEW MONTHS LATER BY

THE UPRISINGS IN POLAND AND HUNGARY THAT THE DESTALINIZATION DRIVE

WOULD TOUCH OFF A WAVE OF UNREST . EVEN THOUGH STALIN HAD BULLIED AND

BETRAYED THE CHINESE COMMUNISTS (AS WELL AS HELPED THEM, AT A PRICE,

DURING THE KOREAN WAR), MAO BELIEVED IN STALIN'S PRINCIPLE OF

CENTRALIZED RULE, PREFERRED A STABLE RED EMPIRE TO ONE IN FERMENT . THE

CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE HASTILY CALLED A SECRET

SESSION ; A MONTH LATER, RED CHINA DEFIANTLY ANNOUNCED THAT, DESPITE

WHAT THE KREMLIN HAD TO SAY, STALIN'S ACHIEVEMENTS OUTWEIGHED HIS

ERRORS . ON FOREIGN POLICY PEKING AGREED FOR THE MOMENT TO BACK

KHRUSHCHEV'S TALK OF PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE WITH THE WEST, SINCE MAO

HIMSELF WAS THEN ENERGETICALLY PUSHING THE " BANDUNG SPIRIT " OF SWEET

NEIGHBORLINESS IN ASIA . EVEN THIS QUALIFIED SUPPORT FOR THE KREMLIN

DISAPPEARED WHEN, IN AUGUST 1957, THE SOVIET UNION TEST-FIRED ITS FIRST

ICBM AND TWO MONTHS LATER LAUNCHED SPUTNIK . RUSSIAN ROCKETRY, PEKING

DECIDED, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY GAVE THE COMMUNIST CAMP MILITARY

SUPERIORITY OVER THE WEST ; THE REDS MUST NOW SEIZE THE ADVANTAGE BY

FOMENTING REVOLUTIONS IN UNDERDEVELOPED NATIONS, EVEN AT THE RISK OF

WAR . INSTEAD, KHRUSHCHEV PURSUED A DETENTE WITH THE WEST . IN 1958 HE

AGREED TO A MORATORIUM ON NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE ATMOSPHERE (BROKEN IN

1961), PARTLY DESIGNED TO FREEZE OUT PEKING AS AN ATOMIC POWER . WHEN

THE CHINESE WANTED RUSSIAN ATOMIC COVER FOR A MOVE AGAINST THE OFFSHORE

ISLANDS AND FORMOSA, MOSCOW REFUSED . FROM GREAT LEAP TO GREAT BRAWL

MEANWHILE, THE RUSSIANS DID NOT SEEM EAGER TO HELP THEIR CHINESE

BROTHERS WITH THEIR GROWING INTERNAL ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES . WHILE

KHRUSHCHEV WOOED NEUTRALIST INDIA AND EGYPT WITH AID, AND EVEN BROUGHT

HIS MONEYBAGS ON A PILGRIMAGE TO THAT RENEGADE RED, TITO, NOT AN

ADDITIONAL RUBLE WAS ALLOTTED TO MAO . THE RED CHINESE USED THE ONLY

SURPLUS RAW MATERIAL AT THEIR COMMAND : PEOPLE . MILLIONS OF PEASANTS

WERE HERDED INTO PEOPLE'S COMMUNES AND HITCHED TO PLOWS . PEKING BROKE

UP FAMILIES, TRIED TO BAN MONEY, JERRY-BUILT HUNDREDS OF " BACKYARD "

STEEL FURNACES . THE SLOGAN WAS : " COMMUNISM CAN GROW GRAIN AND MAKE

STEEL . " THROUGH BRAWN AND " REVOLUTIONARY ROMANTICISM " CHINA WAS TO

TURN ALMOST OVERNIGHT INTO AN INDUSTRIALIZED LAND . THE GREAT LEAP

FORWARD WAS HAILED AS A SHORT CUT TO COMMUNISM AND A SLAP AT MOSCOW .

KHRUSHCHEV WARNED THAT IT COULD NOT BE DONE . AFTER A FEW MONTHS THE

EXPERIMENT INDEED COLLAPSED . GLOATING OVER THE FAILURE, KHRUSHCHEV

TOLD VISITING HUBERT HUMPHREY THAT MAO'S IDEA HAD BEEN FOOLISHLY "

UTOPIAN . " BY THE TIME NIKITA SHOWED UP IN PEKING IN 1959, FRESH FROM

HIS TOUR OF THE U.S . AND THE MEETING WITH IKE AT CAMP DAVID, HE WAS

BARELY ON SPEAKING TERMS WITH HIS HOSTS . THE AIRPORT WAS DECORATED

WITH HUGE POSTERS OF STALIN ; ON THE WAY TO TOWN, KHRUSHCHEV AND MAO

BEGAN AN ARGUMENT THAT LASTED FOR THE NEXT FOUR DAYS . WHEN THE SOVIET

RULER LEFT, NOT EVEN THE NICETIES OF A FORMAL COMMUNIQUE WERE OBSERVED.

BY EARLY 1960 MAO HAD CLEARLY

GIVEN UP HOPE OF PERSUADING KHRUSHCHEV TO CHANGE HIS FLEXIBLE COLD WAR

POLICY, AND BEGAN AN ALL-OUT CHINESE OFFENSIVE DESIGNED TO TOPPLE

KHRUSHCHEV FROM POWER . IT WAS ALSO THE START OF AN ENDLESS ARGUMENT

ABOUT WHETHER AUTHORITY FOR MOSCOW'S " PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE " OR

PEKING'S " INEVITABILITY OF WAR " COULD BE FOUND IN THE SACRED LENIN

TEXTS . ACTUALLY LENIN, AND EVEN STALIN, HAD ARGUED BOTH WAYS AT

VARIOUS TIMES, DEPENDING ON CONDITIONS AND MOSCOW POINTED OUT THAT

CONDITIONS WERE CERTAINLY DIFFERENT IN THE NUCLEAR AGE . WHEN MAO'S MEN

CARRIED THE ATTACK INTO A MEETING OF WORLD COMMUNIST LEADERS IN

BUCHAREST IN JUNE, KHRUSHCHEV WAS INCENSED . " ONE CANNOT MECHANICALLY

REPEAT WHAT LENIN SAID DECADES AGO, " HE SHOUTED . " WE LIVE IN A TIME

WHEN NEITHER MARX NOR ENGELS NOR LENIN IS WITH US . IF WE ACT LIKE

CHILDREN WHO STUDY THE ALPHABET BY BUILDING WORDS OUT OF LETTERS, WE

SHALL NOT GET VERY FAR . " A FULL-DRESS SUMMIT SESSION OF 81 COMMUNIST

PARTIES IN MOSCOW IN NOVEMBER 1960 PRODUCED A STATEMENT (ADOPTED

UNANIMOUSLY, OF COURSE) THAT MERELY LUMPED TOGETHER THESE DIAMETRICALLY

OPPOSED OPINIONS . THEN LAST FALL, THE RED CHINESE INVASION OF INDIA

ONLY SERVED TO JUSTIFY KHRUSHCHEV'S VIEW THAT MAO WAS A RECKLESS

FANATIC, AND MOSCOW OSTENTATIOUSLY FAILED TO BACK PEKING . AS FOR

KHRUSHCHEV'S WITHDRAWAL OF SOVIET MISSILES FROM CUBA, THE MANEUVER

CONFIRMED MAO'S WORST FEARS ABOUT VACILLATING KREMLIN LEADERSHIP,

LEANING FIRST TO " ADVENTURISM, " THEN TO " CAPITULATIONISM . "

THUNDERED PEKING : " IT IS 100 PER CENT APPEASEMENT . A MUNICH PURE

AND SIMPLE . IMPERIALISM IS ONLY A PAPER TIGER . " TO WHICH KHRUSHCHEV

REPLIED : " THE PAPER TIGER HAS NUCLEAR TEETH . ONLY A MADMAN WOULD

SPEAK OF A NEW WORLD WAR . " AND THAT IS ESSENTIALLY WHERE THE ARGUMENT

STILL STANDS . FROM VISION TO DANGER TIME WAS WHEN WESTERN SKEPTICS

WONDERED WHETHER THE SINO-SOVIET SPLIT WAS REAL . KHRUSHCHEV, THEY

FIGURED, MIGHT BE RELATIVELY NICE TO THE WEST ONLY LONG ENOUGH TO

WANGLE SOME CONCESSIONS ON NATO OR NUCLEAR ARMS CONTROL ; THEN MAO

WOULD STEP IN AND TOGETHER THEY WOULD DEMOLISH THE FREE WORLD . TODAY

IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT THE QUARREL IS MERELY AN ACT . IN FACT, THERE

IS A GROWING VISION SHARED BY SUCH DISPARATE PROPHETS AS ARNOLD TOYNBEE

AND CHARLES DE GAULLE OF RUSSIA AND THE WEST SOME DAY STANDING TOGETHER

AS ALLIES AGAINST CHINA . STRANGER THINGS HAVE HAPPENED IN HISTORY .

YET THE VISION HAS ITS DANGERS . THE WEST HAS ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLY

MOVED INTO A NEW ERA OF SOFTNESS TOWARD COMMUNISM . FEW ANY LONGER TALK

OF DEFEATING COMMUNISM ; COEXISTENCE IS MORE OR LESS ACCEPTED IN THE

WEST . THIS MAY BE ONLY REALISTIC IN THE NUCLEAR AGE . BUT ALL OVER THE

WEST THERE IS A CREEPING NOTION THAT KHRUSHCHEV'S KIND OF COMMUNISM CAN

BE LIVED WITH THAT ONLY PEKING'S IS REALLY BAD AND THIS HAS TAKEN MUCH

STEAM OUT OF THE ANTI-COMMUNIST POSITION . NIKITA'S " REASONABLE "

APPROACH HAS HELPED THE ITALIAN REDS GAIN STRENGTH, HAS REVIVED DREAMS

OF A NEW POPULAR FRONT AMONG ONCE SOLIDLY ANTI-COMMUNIST FRENCH

SOCIALISTS, HAS EVEN PROMPTED BELGIAN FOREIGN MINISTER PAUL HENRI SPAAK

TO SAY THAT THE REMOVAL OF U.S . NUCLEAR STOCKPILES FROM WESTERN EUROPE

MIGHT NOT BE SUCH A BAD IDEA AFTER ALL . THESE ARE ONLY MODEST RED

GAINS . BUT KHRUSHCHEV CAN POINT TO THEM TO ARGUE PLAUSIBLY THAT HE IS

NOT NEARLY SO BAD A COMMUNIST STRATEGIST AS PEKING MAKES HIM OUT TO BE

PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S TRIUMPHANT VISIT, CHARLES DE GAULLE MADE NO EFFORT

TO ENTER A POPULARITY CONTEST . BOTH FRENCH AND GERMANS LEGITIMATELY

EMPHASIZED THAT THE TWO-DAY TRIP WAS ONLY A " WORKING VISIT " AS

STIPULATED BY THE BRAND-NEW FRANCO-GERMAN FRIENDSHIP TREATY . AS FAR AS

PROTOCOL AND THE PUBLIC WERE CONCERNED, IT WAS EVEN A KIND OF UNVISIT

NO PARADES, NO CROWDS . THE BONN PRESS PREDICTED THAT DE GAULLE WOULD

TRY TO WHIP THE GERMANS INTO LINE IN CASE THEY HAD GOT TOO FRIENDLY

TOWARD THE U.S . HE WAS NOT AS CRUDE AS THAT . BUT HE HAD BEEN STUNG BY

KENNEDY'S FRANKFURT SPEECH ABOUT ATLANTIC UNITY (ALTHOUGH DISMISSING IT

AS " SALADE, SALADE, SALADE " ), AND DE GAULLE OBVIOUSLY WANTED TO FIND

OUT IN BONN IF THE GERMANS HAD BEEN SUFFICIENTLY IMPRESSED BY IT TO

MOVE AWAY FROM THE FRANCO-GERMAN ALLIANCE . ANSWER : THE GERMANS WERE

JUST ABOUT STANDING STILL . THEY CHIDED DE GAULLE AND HIS TOP MINISTERS

FOR THE ANNOUNCED WITHDRAWAL OF FRENCH NAVAL UNITS FROM THE NATO FLEET

BUT DID NOT PRESS HIM ON THE QUESTION OF BRITAIN'S EVENTUAL ADMISSION

TO THE COMMON MARKET . THERE WAS SOME HAGGLING ON AGRICULTURE ;

BECAUSE OF A PRICE-DEPRESSING AGRICULTURAL SURPLUS, WHICH CAUSED FARM

RIOTS IN SOUTHERN FRANCE LAST WEEK, THE FRENCH HAD JUST CLOSED THEIR

BORDERS TO IMPORTS OF TOMATOES AND APRICOTS, WITHOUT NOTIFYING THE

COMMON MARKET . THE ONLY REALLY SUBSTANTIVE AGREEMENT : A MASSIVE

YOUTH EXCHANGE PROGRAM . AMONG OTHER THINGS, DE GAULLE WANTED TO GET TO

KNOW VICE CHANCELLOR LUDWIG ERHARD, THE MAN WHO WILL TAKE OVER FROM

KONRAD ADENAUER NEXT FALL . THEY HAD AN HOUR'S " FRIENDLY /

ACTUALLY, THEY TALKED PAST EACH OTHER . DE GAULLE KEPT STRESSING THE

MYSTIQUE OF EUROPE, WHILE ERHARD TRIED TO TALK ECONOMICS BUT FOUND THAT

THE GENERAL WAS AS LITTLE INTERESTED IN SUCH MATTERS AS THE CHANCELLOR.

HOPEFUL AND CASUAL . " TREATIES, " HE SAID WITH A SHRUG, " ARE LIKE

HOW JUSTICE COULD BE ACHIEVED IN ATHENS . " IT CAN BE ACHIEVED, "

REPLIED THE GREAT LAWMAKER, IN SUBSTANCE, " IF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT

DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY A WRONG ARE JUST AS INDIGNANT ABOUT IT AS THOSE

WHO ARE PERSONALLY HURT . " THIS GENERALIZED PASSION FOR JUSTICE HAS

ALWAYS BEEN A HARD STANDARD TO LIVE UP TO, BUT U.S . CHIEF JUSTICE EARL

MEETING OF JURISTS THAT CONVENED LAST WEEK IN SOLON'S CITY . FORMAL

TITLE : " FIRST WORLD CONFERENCE ON WORLD PEACE THROUGH LAW . "

CEREMONIALLY WELCOMED BY THE KING AND QUEEN OF GREECE IN THE MARBLE

HALLS OF THE ATHENS HILTON WERE 1,000 JURISTS FROM 105 NATIONS . THE

WORLD-LAWMAN CHARLES SYLVANUS RHYNE, PAST PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN BAR

ASSOCIATION, AND FOLLOWED A SERIES OF PREPARATORY SESSIONS IN COSTA

RICA,

JAPAN, NIGERIA AND ITALY . SAID RHYNE IN HIS KEYNOTE

ADDRESS : " WE SHARE ONE GREAT IDEAL WHICH TRANSCENDS OUR DIVERSITY A

BELIEF THAT IN THE RULE OF LAW LIES THE ROUTE TO WORLD PEACE . " WORLD

LAW, RHYNE CAUTIONED, SHOULD NOT BE THOUGHT OF AS " A DRAMATIC PANACEA

OR CURE-ALL FOR THE WORLD'S ILLS, BUT RATHER A PATIENT LABOR DEMANDING

IMMENSE AND CONSTANT EFFORT TO DEVELOP THE TRUE BASIS FOR CIVILIZED

PROGRESS AND EXISTENCE . " SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS . HENRY R . LUCE,

EDITOR IN CHIEF OF TIME INC., RECALLED THE BIBLICAL PASSAGE, " BLESSED

ARE THE PEACEMAKERS " AND POINTED OUT :

PEACE HAS TO BE MADE . PEACE CANNOT MERELY BE KEPT NOT FOR

LONG BY FORCE OF ARMS . NEITHER WILL PEACE BE GIVEN TO US AS AN

UNDESERVED GIFT FROM HEAVEN . OVERWHELMINGLY, PEACE IS THE WORK OF

JUSTICE, AND THE WORK OF JUSTICE IS MAINLY THE WORK OF THE LAW . " LUCE

URGED HIS LISTENERS TO CARRY THE CASE FOR WORLD LAW " TO ALL

POLITICIANS AND TO ALL THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE WORLD . " SAID HE : " SO

FAR AS I KNOW, NO PRESIDENT OR PRIME MINISTER HAS PUT THE RULE OF LAW

AT THE TOP OF HIS POLITICAL BANNER, " BUT THE " RULE OF LAW CAN BECOME

GOOD POLITICS . " IN SIX DAYS OF DELIBERATIONS, THE JURISTS MODESTLY

BEGAN " THE WORK OF THE LAW " BY SURVEYING THE WORLD'S EXISTING LEGAL

FRAMEWORK AND MAKING SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT . MAIN CONCLUSIONS : .THE

UNITED NATIONS . REALLY TO BE " MANKIND'S BEST HOPE FOR A PEACEFUL

WORLD, " IT NEEDS MORE MUSCLE . U.N . PEACE-KEEPING EFFORTS SHOULD BE

CODIFIED, A PERMANENT " PEACE POLICE FORCE " CREATED, AND THE SECURITY

COUNCIL ENLARGED . THE CONFERENCE RECOMMENDED PARTIAL ABOLITION OF THE

VETO : HENCEFORTH IT SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED WHEN A DISPUTE CAN BE

SETTLED PEACEFULLY . BUT THERE WAS PLAINLY NO DESIRE TO GET INVOLVED IN

THE TOUCHY ISSUE OF U.N . FINANCING . .THE WORLD COURT . WITH MOST

STATES (THE U.S . INCLUDED) RESERVING THE RIGHT TO IGNORE ITS

JURISDICTION, IT HAS RENDERED ONLY 13 FINAL VERDICTS IN ITS 18 YEARS .

MORE NATIONS SHOULD BOW TO IT, SUGGESTED THE ATHENS MEETING . THE COURT

SHOULD BE EMPOWERED TO HEAR CASES BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AS WELL AS STATES

; AND THE POSSIBILITY OF " REGIONAL WORLD COURTS " SHOULD BE EXPLORED.

 .FOREIGN INVESTMENT & TRADE . BOTH SHOULD BE PROTECTED BY A FRAMEWORK

OF MORE EFFICIENT LAW . STATUTES ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT SHOULD BE

CODIFIED, AND SPECIAL COURTS CONSIDERED FOR SETTLING DISPUTES .

NATIONAL COMMITTEES OF LAWYERS SHOULD BE SET UP TO STUDY THE LEGAL

MACHINERY FOR TRADE, AND IMPROVED POLICING OF INTERNATIONAL PATENTS . .

SPACE . THE NEWEST FRONTIER PROVOKED MORE QUESTIONS THAN

RECOMMENDATIONS . WHERE DOES AIRSPACE (OVER WHICH NATIONS EXERT

SOVEREIGNTY) END, AND OUTER SPACE (WHICH NO COUNTRY HAS YET CLAIMED)

BEGIN ? ARE THE MOON AND PLANETS OPEN DOMAIN LIKE COLUMBUS' NEW

WORLD, WHERE THE HOISTING OF FLAG AND CROSS WAS SUFFICIENT TO ESTABLISH

SOVEREIGNTY ? ON THE LATTER, THE CONFERENCE SAID NO THAT THE U.N .

SHOULD BE GRANTED SOVEREIGNTY OVER ALL OBJECTS OF OUTER SPACE, NO

MATTER WHICH NATION'S SPACESHIPS LAND ON THEM FIRST . DELEGATES FURTHER

SUGGESTED ADOPTION OF " THE PRINCIPLE OF LIABILITY FOR INJURY FROM

SPACE ACCIDENTS, " URGED AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE TO FORGE A BODY OF

SPACE LAW . SALVATION PROCLAMATION . AT WEEK'S END, THESE SIMILAR

TOPICS WERE ADOPTED AS A " GLOBAL WORK PROGRAM . " THE JURISTS ALSO 1)

AGREED TO FOUND A WORLD PEACE THROUGH LAW CENTER, TO BE ORGANIZED BY

RHYNE, WHICH WILL SERVE AS A RESEARCH CLEARINGHOUSE FOR ALL THE WORLD'S

LEGAL SYSTEMS, 2) SET IN MOTION PLANS FOR A WORLD RULE OF LAW YEAR, 3)

DREW UP A " PROCLAMATION OF ATHENS, " STATING THEIR CASE BEFORE WORLD

OPINION . " THIS CONFERENCE, " SAID THE PROCLAMATION, " BEING DEEPLY

CONCERNED WITH THE FACT THAT VIOLATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN

INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS CAN ONLY LEAD TO DESTRUCTION OF MANKIND THROUGH

NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST, HEREBY PROCLAIMS THAT LAW MUST REPLACE FORCE AS THE

CONTROLLING FACTOR IN THE FATE OF HUMANITY . " ONE MEASURE OF THE

DIFFICULTY OF THAT TASK : ALTHOUGH INVITATIONS WENT TO ALL COMMUNIST

COUNTRIES, NONE (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF YUGOSLAVIA) SENT DELEGATIONS TO

ATHENS .

GREAT BRITAIN AND THEN THERE WERE THREE HAROLD MACMILLAN

VALIANTLY TRIED TO DIVERT BRITAIN'S MIND FROM SEX AND SECURITY .

DISPLAYING SOMETHING LIKE HIS OLD FORM IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, HE

DELIVERED AN ELOQUENT SPEECH ON PROSPECTS FOR DISARMAMENT AND A SUMMIT

CONFERENCE THAT WAS RECEIVED RESPECTFULLY EVEN BY THE OPPOSITION . BUT

MACMILLAN'S ELOQUENCE COULD NOT DIMINISH TORY DISTRESS OVER THE THREE

SEPARATE SCANDALS THAT PLAGUED HIS GOVERNMENT . FIRST, OF COURSE, WAS

THE CONTINUATION OF THE PROFUMO CASE . IN MARYLEBONE MAGISTRATES'

COURT, OSTEOPATH STEPHEN WARD, MENTOR OF CHRISTINE KEELER AND FRIEND OF

DISGRACED WAR SECRETARY JOHN PROFUMO, WAS ORDERED TO STAND TRIAL ON

SEVEN CHARGES OF PROCURING, ARRANGING ABORTIONS, AND LIVING OFF THE

EARNINGS OF PROSTITUTION . BY THE CLOSE OF THE THREE-DAY HEARING,

MAGISTRATE LEO GRADWELL HAD PERMITTED NUMEROUS WITNESSES TO TESTIFY

WITHOUT REVEALING THEIR IDENTITY, EVEN ALLOWED ONE WITNESS TO LEAVE THE

COURT SHROUDED IN A TOPCOAT . NEXT, THERE WAS THE CASE OF ITALIAN

NUCLEAR PHYSICIST GIUSEPPE ENRICO MARTELLI, WHO DENIED AT THE OLD

BAILEY LAST WEEK THAT HE HAD PREPARED TO SPY FOR THE RUSSIANS, SAID

THAT ON THE CONTRARY, FOR SEVEN YEARS HE HAD RESISTED RUSSIAN PRESSURE

TO BECOME A RED AGENT . BUT THE CROWN CONTENDED THAT MARTELLI WAS

CAUGHT WITH SHOES THAT HAD HOLLOWED-OUT SECRET COMPARTMENTS IN THE

HEELS AND THAT HIS CIGARETTE PACKAGES CONTAINED WAFER-THIN PADS WITH

SECRET CODES AND PASSWORDS . FINALLY, THERE WAS THE CASE OF HAROLD

ADRIAN RUSSELL PHILBY, JOURNALIST, EX-FOREIGN OFFICE OFFICIAL, AND BOON

COMPANION OF COMMUNIST SPIES GUY BURGESS AND DONALD MACLEAN, WHOSE

REAPPEARANCE IN THE NEWS RECALLED THE MOST NOTORIOUS OF BRITAIN'S

SEX-AND-SPY SCANDALS . OUT OF SIGHT . " KIM " PHILBY HAD KNOWN BURGESS

SINCE UNDERGRADUATE DAYS AT CAMBRIDGE, WELCOMED HIM AS A BOARDER IN HIS

HOUSE WHEN BOTH WERE STATIONED AT THE BRITISH EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON IN

1950 . WHEN BURGESS AND MACLEAN ELOPED TO RUSSIA IN 1951, PHILBY WAS

FORCED TO RESIGN FROM THE FOREIGN OFFICE AMIDST A FLURRY OF RUMORS THAT

HE WAS " THE THIRD MAN " WHO HAD TIPPED THEM OFF THAT THE POLICE WERE

ON THEIR TRAIL . LATER, THIS CHARGE WAS INDIGNANTLY DENIED BY HAROLD

MACMILLAN, THEN FOREIGN SECRETARY, WHO PERSONALLY VOUCHED FOR PHILBY'S

GOOD CHARACTER . THE FOREIGN OFFICE EVEN ASKED THE OBSERVER TO HIRE

PHILBY AS A CORRESPONDENT BECAUSE " IT SEEMED UNFAIR THAT SO ABLE A MAN

SHOULD BE FINDING DIFFICULTY IN EARNING A LIVING NOW THAT HE HAD

CLEARANCE FROM THE FOREIGN SECRETARY . " THE PUBLICATION TOOK THE HINT

AND, ALONG WITH THE ECONOMIST, SENT PHILBY TO THE MIDDLE EAST, WHERE

HIS FATHER, ST . JOHN PHILBY, THE FAMED ARAB SCHOLAR, HAD SPENT YEARS

EXPLORING THE DESERT . BUT LAST JANUARY, BESET WITH FINANCIAL AND

ALCOHOL PROBLEMS, PHILBY SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED FROM HIS BEIRUT HOME AND

DROPPED OUT OF SIGHT . LAST WEEK, IN THE COMMONS, LORD PRIVY SEAL

EDWARD HEATH REVEALED THAT PHILBY HAD SURFACED " IN ONE OF THE

COUNTRIES OF THE SOVIET BLOC . " NEW INFORMATION HAD COME TO LIGHT,

SAID HEATH, THAT REVEALED THAT PHILBY HAD BEEN A SOVIET AGENT WHILE

WORKING FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND IN FACT HAD BEEN THE TIPSTER WHO HAD

WARNED BURGESS AND MACLEAN . TO THE HOUSE, MACMILLAN PRAISED BRITAIN'S

SECURITY SERVICES FOR COMING UP WITH THE NEW INFORMATION OVERLOOKING

THE FACT THAT THEY HAD COTTONED TO IT TWELVE YEARS TOO LATE . CASE OF

JITTERS . IN MOSCOW, GUY BURGESS WAS AMUSED BY THE REVELATIONS IN

PARLIAMENT . " MARK YOU, MY DEAR BOY, " HE TOLD A REPORTER, " THE

LONGER I STAY IN THE SOVIET UNION AND READ ABOUT THE SCANDALS IN

ENGLAND, THE MORE GLAD I AM TO BE HERE, THE MORE I BELIEVE THAT ANY

CIVILIZED PERSON LIKE PHILBY MIGHT EASILY WANT TO COME HERE . " BUT

BURGESS DENIED THAT PHILBY OR ANYONE ELSE HAD WARNED HIM AND MACLEAN

THAT THEY WERE UNDER SUSPICION . IN FACT, DECLARED BURGESS, MACLEAN

ONLY LEARNED THAT HE WAS BEING TAILED WHEN A LONDON TAXI HE WAS RIDING

IN ONE DAY WAS RAMMED IN A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT BY A CARFUL OF BRITISH

SECRET SERVICE AGENTS . SUMMING UP " THIS LATEST SCHEMOZZLE " INVOLVING

THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, BURGESS REMARKED : " SOMEONE ONCE SAID, "

THERE IS NOTHING SO SQUALID AS A PATRICIAN IN A PANIC.' THE HEAD OF

BRITISH SECURITY IS USUALLY A PATRICIAN, AND PANIC SEEMS TO BE

UNIVERSAL . " BACK HOME, THE TORIES MIGHT NOT BE PANICKED, BUT THEY

WERE SHOWING A BAD CASE OF THE JITTERS . IN TWO BY-ELECTIONS,

CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATES FINISHED DISMALLY BEHIND LABOR .

IN 1845, BEFORE THE POTATO FAMINE DECIMATED ITS

POPULATION, IRELAND WAS WESTERN EUROPE'S MOST DENSELY SETTLED COUNTRY

; SINCE THEN, ITS 9,000,000 INHABITANTS HAVE DWINDLED TO 2,824,000 .

IRELAND IS THE ONLY NATION IN EUROPE WHOSE POPULATION HAS SHRUNK IN

THAT TIME . WHILE IRISHMEN LEFT THE COUNTRY IN WAVES, THEY ENTERED IT

IN A TRICKLE, FOR IRELAND HAS THE LOWEST MARRIAGE RATE, AND ONE OF THE

LOWEST BIRTH RATES, IN ALL EUROPE . TO THE NEO-MALTHUSIAN, THE IRISH

WOULD SEEM MODELS OF ECOLOGICAL BALANCE . IN A COUNTRY WHERE FOOD

PRODUCTION IS BARELY INCREASING, 66 PER CENT OF ALL IRISH MALES BETWEEN

20 AND 39 ARE BACHELORS, AND VAST NUMBERS OF MEN AND WOMEN DIE SINGLE .

/ HOLY IRELAND . " THE EXODUS FROM IRELAND, WHICH NOVELIST GEORGE MOORE

IRONICALLY JUSTIFIED BY CALLING IRELAND " A FATAL DISEASE " FROM WHICH

/ IT IS THE PLAIN DUTY OF EVERY IRISHMAN TO DISSOCIATE HIMSELF, "

CONTINUED AFTER THE COUNTRY WON ITS INDEPENDENCE FROM BRITAIN IN 1921 .

AS IN MOST OTHER NEWLY LIBERATED COUNTRIES, THE MEN WHO TOOK OVER WERE

ROMANTIC REVOLUTIONARY HEROES, STEEPED IN THE OTHERWORLD BUT ILL

PREPARED BY EXPERIENCE TO MEET THE PRACTICAL CHALLENGES OF BUILDING A

MODERN NATION . " WHEN DRAKE WAS WINNING SEAS FOR ENGLAND, " IN POET

PATRICK KAVANAGH'S RUEFUL LINES, AILED IN PUDDLES OF THE PAST . " FOR

THE MOST PART, IRELAND'S POSTLIBERATION POLITICIANS AND INTELLECTUALS

SEEMED DETERMINED TO IGNORE THE SEAS FOR THE PUDDLES . FOR YEARS THEY

KEPT UP THE STRIDENT OUTCRY OVER PARTITION AND WINKED AT ENDLESS,

SQUALID RAIDS ON THE ULSTER BORDER . IRELAND, AFTER ALL, WAS A DIVIDED

COUNTRY FOR DECADES BEFORE SUCH LATECOMERS TO PARTITION AS GERMANY,

KOREA AND VIET NAM . IN MANY REFRESHING WAYS, THE LAND HAS REMAINED

TRUE TO ITS LEADERS' VISION OF A PASTORAL " HOLY IRELAND . " THE IRISH

SPEND ONLY ONE-FIFTH AS MUCH YEARLY ($8,000,000) FOR DEFENSE AS NEW

YORKERS PAY EACH YEAR FOR GARBAGE COLLECTION . THEY DO NOT SUPPORT A

SINGLE SUPERHIGHWAY, NIGHTCLUB, PARKING METER, STRIP JOINT OR SUBWAY .

THE SUICIDE RATE IS EUROPE'S LOWEST . CRIMES OF ANY KIND ARE FEW AND

GETTING FEWER ALTHOUGH THE AUTHORITIES ADMIT THAT THE NATION'S

COMMONEST TRANSGRESSION, LARCENY OF PEDAL CYCLES, BEARS WATCHING .

PORTHER & SHAMROCK . IN ECONOMIC TERMS, IRELAND'S INSULAR IDEAL PROVED

DISASTROUS . TRUE TO THE AIMS OF THE SINN FEIN (OURSELVES ALONE)

MOVEMENT, THE GOVERNMENT IN THE '30S DISCOURAGED FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN

IRELAND, RAISED SOME OF THE WORLD'S HIGHEST TARIFF BARRIERS TO EXCLUDE

BRITISH GOODS AND PROTECT NEW, HIGHLY INEFFICIENT DOMESTIC INDUSTRY .

THE RESULT OF ITS BELT TIGHTENING WAS A RISING TIDE OF EMIGRANTS THAT

BY 1956 REACHED 600,000, HIGHEST SINCE THE 1890S . AMONG THOSE WHO

STAYED ON, THERE WAS A PARALYZING SENSE OF FRUSTRATION AND FATALISM .

LIFE WAS NOT ONLY HARD IT WAS DULL . TO MANY IRISHMEN, THE PERVERSE,

PERVASIVE MEDIOCRITY OF THEIR CULTURE WAS TYPIFIED BY GAELIC-WORSHIP .

THE DYING GAELIC TONGUE HAD BECOME THE BADGE OF IRISH NATIONALISM

DURING THE REVOLUTION THOUGH FEW OF ITS LEADERS COULD SPEAK IT . EVEN

BEFORE 1949, WHEN THE REPUBLIC OF EIRE WAS ESTABLISHED, THE GOVERNMENT

HAD MADE GAELIC LANGUAGE STUDY COMPULSORY IN THE SCHOOLS, EVEN

ENCOURAGED STUDENTS TO TAKE OTHER SUBJECTS ENTIRELY IN GAELIC .

AFTER THE LONG EMOTIONAL EXCITEMENT OF THE FIGHT

HIBERNATING, CAUGHT IN A DESCENDING SPIRAL OF CYNICISM AND FECKLESS

NOSTALGIA . ITS MALAISE WAS EXPRESSED BY PLAYWRIGHT SEAN O'CASEY : "

SOMEONE OR SOMETHING IS RUINING US . WHAT DO WE SEND OUT TO THE WORLD

NOW BUT WOEFUL THINGS YOUNG LADS AND LASSIES, PORTHER, GREYHOUNDS,

SWEEP TICKETS, AND THE SHAMROCK GREEN ? WE'VE SCATTHERED OURSELVES

OVER THE WIDE WORLD, AND LEFT OUR OWN SWEET LAND THIN . WE'RE JUST

STANDING ON OUR KNEES NOW . " BLOODY BALUBA . TODAY THE IRISH ARE

BEGINNING TO STAND ON THEIR FEET . IN BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT,

UNIVERSITIES AND PUBS, THERE IS A NEW SENSE OF PURPOSE AND PUSH, A

MOUNTING AWARENESS THAT IRELAND HAS FINALLY BEGUN TO MAKE ITS WAY IN

THE WORLD . AFTER FOUR DECADES OF BROODY ISOLATION, AND SEEMINGLY

PRO-GERMAN NEUTRALITY IN WORLD WAR II (ALTHOUGH IN THEIR CONTRARY WAY,

MANY IRISH VOLUNTEERED FOR THE BRITISH ARMY), A NEWLY OUTWARD-LOOKING

IRELAND HAS ACQUIRED INTERNATIONAL INFLUENCE OUT OF ALL PROPORTION TO

ITS SIZE OR POLITICAL POWER . IN THE UNITED NATIONS, THE NONALIGNED

IRISH LED BY AMBASSADOR FREDERICK BOLAND, WHO WAS PRESIDENT OF THE

GENERAL ASSEMBLY IN THE TIME OF KHRUSHCHEV'S SHOE-BANGING TANTRUM ARE

UNIVERSALLY RESPECTED . IN THE CONGO, WHERE 5,000 IRISH TROOPS HAVE

SERVED AND 26 DIED WITH THE U.N . PEACEKEEPING MISSION, THEIR PROBITY

AND DISCIPLINE COMMAND THE ADMIRATION OF AFRICANS AND BELGIANS ALIKE .

THE EXPERIENCE HAS ADDED A NEW TERM OF ABUSE TO THE IRISHMAN'S COPIOUS

VOCABULARY OF INVECTIVE : " YOU BLOODY BALUBA ! "  THE U.N . IRISH

HAVE TAUGHT MANY A NATIVE TO DANCE A JIG . SAYS A CAPTAIN FROM CORK :

/ ONLY THE IRISH AND OTHER HEATHENS CAN APPRECIATE OUR DAHLING PIPES .

/ TWO-WAY BRIDGE . AS THE MAN WHO HAS DONE MOST TO END HIS COUNTRY'S

LONG SLEEP, SEAN LEMASS GOT HIS CHANCE WHEN HE TOOK OVER AS TAOISEACH

IN 1959 . DE VALERA, NEAR-BLIND AND DOGGEDLY INDIFFERENT TO THE

COUNTRY'S WORSENING ECONOMIC PLIGHT, WAS PERSUADED BY HIS OWN FIANNA

FAIL PARTY TO STEP ASIDE FOR LEMASS AND RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY . HIS

SUCCESSOR, AFTER 19 YEARS AS MINISTER OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY, WAS

PASSIONATELY CONVINCED THAT IRELAND'S TIMOROUS PROTECTIONISM COULD ONLY

LEAD TO NATIONAL EXTINCTION . AS FIANNA FAIL'S NEW LEADER, LEMASS WAS

THE ANTITHESIS OF ALL THE OLD FIRE-BREATHING HEROES, TALKED TRADE AND

TARIFFS TO THE VOTERS IN INTENSE, RAPID-FIRE SENTENCES THAT MANY FOUND

HARD TO FOLLOW . " THAT LEMASS ! " SNORTED ONE DUBIOUS DUBLIN

POLITICIAN . " HE COULDN'T LEAD IRELAND OVER O'CONNELL BRIDGE . " WHAT

SEAN LEMASS WANTED MOST WAS TO LURE FOREIGN INVESTORS OVER O'CONNELL

BRIDGE . THE NEW PRIME MINISTER SENT BLARNEY-BLESSED SALESMEN AROUND

THE WORLD PERSUADING FOREIGN INDUSTRIES TO SET UP PLANTS IN IRELAND .

THEY OFFERED ONE OF THE FEW LABOR SURPLUSES IN ALL EUROPE, LIBERAL

GRANTS FOR EQUIPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION, AND ADDITIONAL CASH TO COMPANIES

THAT WOULD BUILD PLANTS AND TRAIN WORKERS IN IRELAND'S PINCHED

NORTHWEST AND SOUTH .

A TRIBE IN NORTH KATANGA THAT AMBUSHED AN IRISH CONTINGENT

IN !960, KILLING TEN OF ITS SOLDIERS .

MANY IRISHMEN WERE PROFANELY SKEPTICAL, BUT THE

PROGRAM SO FAR HAS PROVED A GALLIVANTING SUCCESS . IRELAND TODAY IS IN

THE THROES OF A BELATED INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION THAT IS BOOSTING LIVING

STANDARDS, DIVERSIFYING ITS FARM-BASED ECONOMY, AND WILL INCREASINGLY

ABSORB THE TALENTS THAT THE NATION BREEDS . SINCE 1955, 160 NEW IRISH

AND FOREIGN-BACKED PLANTS HAVE CREATED 21,000 NEW JOBS AND ARE TURNING

OUT GOODS RANGING FROM TRANSISTOR RADIOS (JAPANESE) AND PIANOS (DUTCH)

TO HEAVY CRANES FOR A GERMAN COMPANY AND OIL HEATERS FOR A FRENCH FIRM

. FIFTY MORE PLANTS ARE NEARING COMPLETION, MOST NOTABLY A FRENCH-OWNED

AVIATION FACTORY TO TURN OUT A NEW, SHORT-HAUL PLANE AIMED SPECIFICALLY

AT U.S . FEEDER AIRLINES . THE SHINY NEW PLANTS IN SHANNON, CORK,

LIMERICK, DUBLIN AND KILLARNEY ( " JUST LIKE THE BLACK FOREST, " SAYS A

WEST GERMAN INDUSTRIALIST WHO HAS BUILT A FACTORY THERE) HAVE WORKED NO

ECONOMIC MIRACLE IN IRELAND TO COMPARE WITH EUROPE'S BOOM . BUT

INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION HAS RISEN 20 PER CENT IN THREE YEARS . AND ITS

SUCCESS IS STANCHING THE POPULATION OUTFLOW : FROM AN AVERAGE OF

43,000 A YEAR, THE NUMBER OF EMIGRANTS DROPPED BY MORE THAN 50 PER CENT

LAST YEAR, IS EXPECTED TO TOTAL ONLY 14,000 IN 1963 . MANY EMIGRANTS

ARE NOW RETURNING TO TAKE JOBS BACK HOME . FOUR RS . TODAY'S EXPANSION

WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE IF SEAN LEMASS HAD NOT STARTED LAYING THE

GROUNDWORK LONG AGO . LEMASS IS THE GREAT-GRANDSON OF A HATTER WHO

LANDED IN DUBLIN IN 1820 . A YOUNG-APPEARING 63, HE IS BY AGE, IF NOT

BY POLITICAL STYLE, A MEMBER OF THE GENERATION THAT FREED IRELAND AND

HAS RULED IT EVER SINCE . AT SCHOOL, HE LEARNED HIS FOUR RS IN THE

DUBLIN OF 50 YEARS AGO, REVOLUTION WAS PART OF THE CURRICULUM AND BY

THE AGE OF 14 HAD JOINED THE REPUBLICAN NA FIANNA EIREANN, A SORT OF

BOY SCOUT UNDERGROUND . TWO YEARS LATER, WHEN THE IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY

OCCUPIED THE DUBLIN POST OFFICE AT THE START OF THE BOTCHED 1916 EASTER

WEEK RISING, SEAN WAS THE YOUNGEST REBEL OF THEM ALL, SPENT FOUR DAYS

ON THE ROOF WITH A RIFLE, WAITING FOR THE BRITISH TO MOUNT AN

OLD-FASHIONED INFANTRY CHARGE . HE SAYS WRYLY : " I'M AFRAID WE HAD

RATHER NAIVE IDEAS ABOUT MODERN WARFARE . " WHEN BRITISH SHELLS ENDED

THE FIASCO, 15 IRISH LEADERS WERE SHOT . YOUNG LEMASS WAS TAKEN

PRISONER AND RELEASED WITHIN A MONTH, PRESUMABLY BECAUSE OF HIS AGE .

ACCORDING TO CHERISHED, IF APOCRYPHAL DUBLIN LEGEND, " THE COPS GAVE

A KICK IN THE ARSE AND TOLD HIM TO GO HOME TO HIS MOM . " POOR RISK .

BUT IN THE TURBULENT YEARS WHEN THE IRISH REBELS FOUGHT AGAINST

BRITAIN'S BLACK AND TANS, SEAN LEMASS GREW INTO A RUGGED GUERRILLA

FIGHTER IN THE I.R.A.'S DUBLIN BRIGADE . HE WAS JAILED BY THE ENGLISH

FOUR TIMES, ESCAPED ONCE . AFTER THE 1921 TREATY, BY WHICH BRITAIN

CREATED THE SELF-GOVERNING IRISH FREE STATE BUT RETAINED JURISDICTION

OVER THE SIX PROTESTANT COUNTIES OF ULSTER, CIVIL WAR FLARED BETWEEN "

PRO-TREATY " IRISHMEN AND DE VALERA'S FOLLOWERS, WHO CRIED THAT IRELAND

COULD NOT ACCEPT PARTITION . LEMASS, AN OFFICER ON DE VALERA'S STAFF,

WAS CAPTURED BY THE OTHER SIDE AND IMPRISONED FOR A YEAR . IN JAIL HE

CONTINUED HIS WAR-SHATTERED EDUCATION WITH A CRAM COURSE IN ECONOMICS,

POLITICS AND IRISH REVOLUTIONARY WRITINGS . THOUGH HE NEVER RETURNED TO

PRISON AFTER HIS RELEASE IN 1923, FOUR-TIME LOSER LEMASS WAS PLAINLY A

POOR MATRIMONIAL RISK . WHEN HE STARTED COURTING PRETTY, VIVACIOUS

KATHLEEN HUGHES, HE HAD THE ADDED DISADVANTAGES OF HAVING TO PLACATE

HER FATHER, A DUBLIN CARPENTER AND AN ANGLOPHILE . HE WARNED HIS

DAUGHTER : " THAT BOY IS ALWAYS ON THE RUN ; HE'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO

MAKE A HOME FOR YOU . " KATHLEEN DECIDED TO RISK IT ANYWAY . THEY WERE

MARRIED IN 1924, HAVE A SON NOEL, WHO IS A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, AND

THREE DAUGHTERS (THE ELDEST, MAUREEN, IS MARRIED TO CHARLES HAUGHEY,

THE SHREWD, HARD-KNUCKLED MINISTER OF JUSTICE, WHO IS TIPPED AS A

POTENTIAL PRIME MINISTER) .

LEMASS' BOLD PROGRAM OF INDUSTRIALIZATION HAS

ALREADY CREATED NEW JOBS AND WEALTH IN AN ECONOMY WHOSE PRIMARY

PRODUCT, BEEF FOR BRITAIN, HAS BEEN THE SAME FOR AS LONG AS THERE HAVE

BEEN POTATOES TO GO WITH IT . AS NEW OPPORTUNITY AT HOME LOWERS THE

PERILOUSLY HIGH EMIGRATION RATE, THE GOVERNMENT IS FINALLY BEGINNING TO

REBUT THE BITTER QUIP THAT IRELAND IS " A HOME FOR MEN RATHER THAN A

BREEDING GROUND FOR EMIGRANTS AND BULLOCKS . " THE COUNTRY'S RAPTUROUS

HUZZAS FOR JOHN KENNEDY WERE MORE THAN AN EXPRESSION OF PRIDE IN A GAEL

MADE GOOD TO MANY YOUNG IRISHMEN, HE SEEMS MORE REAL THAN THE IRISH

MARTYRS WHOSE STREAKED STATUES FILL DUBLIN'S PARKS WITH SILENT

DECLAMATION . JACK'S HOMECOMING EPITOMIZED TO THE IRISH THE SUCCESSFUL

DISTANCE THEY THEMSELVES HAVE TRAVELED . SPANGLISH & SPELLS . HOWEVER

FAR THEY MAY GO, THE IRISH RETAIN A DEEP SENSE OF THEIR PAST AND THE

MYTHS AND MEMORIES THAT CROWD THEIR WILD, LONELY LAND . " THE GODS

WHISTLE IN THE AIR, " WROTE SEAN O'FAOLAIN . " THE OTHERWORLD IS ALWAYS

AT ONE'S SHOULDER . " THE OTHERWORLD AND THE REAL PAST ARE INSEPARABLY

BOUND TOGETHER IN THE IRISH IMAGINATION AND IN THE RUNIC PLACE NAMES,

FROM THE PAGAN LANDMARK CALLED TWO BREASTS OF DANA TO ANCIENT

WATERFORD, WHERE IN 1170 STRONGBOW, THE NORMAN EARL OF PEMBROKE,

CLAMPED 7F CENTURIES OF ENGLISH RULE ON IRELAND . WHAT THE MISTS OF

LEGEND CANNOT OBSCURE IS THAT FOR AGES OF RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION AND

ECONOMIC EXPLOITATION, THROUGH COUNTLESS RISINGS AND REPRISALS, THE

IRISH SLAVED, STARVED AND BATTLED FOR THEIR LAND AS STUBBORNLY AS IF

IRELAND ITSELF WERE THE ISLE OF THE BLEST . THE REMOTE LITTLE ISLAND IN

THE ATLANTIC HAS CAST ITS SHADOW ACROSS THE CIVILIZED WORLD SINCE THE

DARK AGES, WHEN IRISH PRIESTS AND SCHOLARS ROAMED EUROPE EXPOUNDING NEW

(AND MOSTLY HERETICAL) THEOLOGIES . IN A DIASPORA EVEN GREATER THAN THE

EXPULSION OF THE JEWS, MORE THAN 3,000,000 IRISHMEN IN THE PAST 100

YEARS HAVE SCATTERED ACROSS THE WORLD, FORMING WHAT AN IRISH WRITER

CALLS " ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREAT SECRET SOCIETIES, WITH BRANCHES

EVERYWHERE " THOUGH THE SOCIETY WAS NEVER VERY SECRET . EVERYONE HAS

HIS OWN LIST OF GREAT IRISHMEN, BUT THERE IS NO DENYING THAT THE GIFTS

OF THE IRISH HAVE ALWAYS ENRICHED OTHER COUNTRIES MORE THAN THEIR OWN .

THEIR TALENT FOR POLITICS, FOR FAITH, ABOVE ALL FOR WORDS, GAVE MORE

BRILLIANT POLITICIANS, DISTINGUISHED CHURCHMEN AND MAGICAL WRITERS TO

THE U.S . AND THE REST OF THE WORLD THAN TO IRELAND . PERHAPS ONLY

THEIR TALENT FOR FIGHTING, WHILE AMPLY EXPORTED, AS AMPLY REMAINED AT

HOME . THOUGH IN FOREIGN LANDS, THEY INVINCIBLY STAYED THEMSELVES ;

THEY ALSO SHOWED AN UNCANNY ABILITY TO ADAPT TO OTHER CULTURES, WHETHER

IN LATIN AMERICA, WHERE THEY CONCOCTED A LILTING LINGUA FRANCA KNOWN AS

SPANGLISH, OR DOWN UNDER, WHERE THEY DEVELOPED A SPECTACULAR SPORT

KNOWN AS AUSTRALIAN RULES, A BLEND OF GAELIC FOOTBALL AND RUGBY .

THOUGH THERE WAS HARDLY A COUNTRY OR A FIELD OF ENDEAVOR WHERE IRISHMEN

FAILED TO MAKE A MARK OR A MINT, THE DIMINISHING NUMBER OF THEIR

COMPATRIOTS AT HOME KEPT WONDERING FRETFULLY IF THEY WERE A VANISHING

RACE .

HEAT WITH PEAT . WHEN SINN FEIN BROKE APART, YOUNG LEMASS

WAS THE CHIEF ARCHITECT OF DE VALERA'S NEW FIANNA FAIL (HEROES OF

DESTINY) PARTY, WHICH CAME TO POWER IN 1932 AND HAS BEEN IN OFFICE

ALMOST CONTINUALLY EVER SINCE . AT 32, LEMASS WAS THE YOUNGEST MEMBER

OF DE VALERA'S CABINET AND EARNED THE AFFECTIONATE BIBLICAL SOBRIQUET "

BENJAMIN " (AFTER JACOB'S YOUNGEST SON) . THOUGH DEV HAD TAUGHT

MATHEMATICS AND IS FERVENTLY BELIEVED BY MANY FOND COMPATRIOTS TO BE

ONE OF THE 13 MEN ON EARTH WHO COMPREHEND THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY THE

TAOISEACH HAD NEITHER HEAD NOR HEART FOR ECONOMICS, AND LEFT BENJAMIN

TO RUN HIS MINISTRY AS HE SAW FIT . LEMASS FACED MONUMENTAL PROBLEMS,

FOR DURING THE '30S THE GOVERNMENT WAS LOCKED IN A VINDICTIVE, FUTILE

ECONOMIC WAR WITH THE ENGLISH, THOUGH IT REMAINED ECONOMICALLY

DEPENDENT ON BRITAIN . HE STROVE DESPERATELY TO MOBILIZE ENOUGH NEW

INDUSTRY TO SUPPLY THE NATION'S BASIC NEEDS, THOUGH AT HIGH COST ; HE

ALSO FOUNDED THE STATE TRANSPORT NETWORK AND ORGANIZED A NATIONAL

MERCHANT MARINE IN TIME TO KEEP IRELAND FED DURING WORLD WAR II, IN

WHICH HE TOOK ON THE ADDITIONAL JOB OF MINISTER OF SUPPLY, AND BY

BRILLIANT IMPROVISATION AVERTED CRIPPLING SHORTAGES . UNTIL RECENTLY,

IT WAS AXIOMATIC THAT " NOBODY BUT A FOOL WOULD INVEST " IN IRELAND .

LEMASS DID NOT HESITATE TO USE PUBLIC FUNDS WHEREVER PRIVATE CAPITAL

WAS NOT FORTHCOMING FOR KEY PROJECTS . HE TOOK OVER A ONE-HORSE POWER

COMPANY AND BUILT IT INTO A NATIONWIDE NETWORK THAT HAS ELECTRIFIED 76

PER CENT OF ALL IRISH FARMS . THE COUNTRY HAD NO OIL AND LITTLE COAL,

BUT LEMASS FOUND AN INEXHAUSTIBLE SOURCE OF INDUSTRIAL FUEL IN ITS PEAT

BOGS, WHERE HUGE MACHINES NOW CUT TURF THAT A BUSY, STATE-OWNED

PROCESSING PLANT TURNS INTO INEXPENSIVE, SLOWBURNING BRIQUETTES . AFTER

A LONG POLITICAL WRANGLE, HE GOT IRELAND'S STATE-OWNED AIRLINE OFF THE

GROUND, AND HAS WATCHED HAPPILY AS AER LINGUS' SHAMROCK-PAINTED PLANES

HAVE MADE IT ONE OF THE FEW GOVERNMENT AIRLINES TO TURN A CONSISTENT

PROFIT ON THE ATLANTIC RUN . THE VERY WORD SOCIALISM TERRIFIES FIANNA

FAIL SUPPORTERS, WHO ARE NOT ONLY OVERWHELMINGLY CATHOLIC BUT INCLUDE

MANY SMALL LANDOWNERS . YET ONE-THIRD OF ALL INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES IN

IRELAND TODAY ARE BANKROLLED BY THE GOVERNMENT, WHICH HAS GONE FARTHER

TOWARD NATIONALIZATION THAN EVEN BRITAIN'S SOCIALISTS ADVOCATE . LEMASS

SAYS HE SHARES THE ATTITUDE TOWARD SOCIALISM THAT WAS EXPRESSED IN THE

LATE POPE JOHN'S ENCYCLICAL, PACEM IN TERRIS : THAT NO POLITICAL

SYSTEM IS UNDESIRABLE IF IT BENEFITS THE PEOPLE . TRIM SAILS . IN 1957,

AFTER THEIR CHILDREN HAD GROWN UP, SEAN AND KATHLEEN LEMASS MOVED FROM

THEIR BIG OLD HOUSE IN DUBLIN TO AN UNPRETENTIOUS SEVENROOM BUNGALOW IN

A PLEASANT SUBURB SOUTH OF THE CAPITAL, WHERE THE PRIME MINISTER IS

PICKED UP BY A GOVERNMENT CAR AT 9 : 45 A.M . EACH DAY . HE SELDOM

RETURNS UNTIL AFTER DINNER . SOME YEARS AGO, LEMASS CUT DOWN ON GOLF

AND CARDS TO THE RELIEF OF OLD POKER CRONIES WHO USUALLY WOUND UP

LOSERS WHEN LEMASS PLAYED TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO THE JOB . STURDY (5 FT

. 10 IN.) AND CAREFULLY GROOMED, HE HOLDS AMONG HIS FEW FOIBLES AN

AVERSION TO THE BYRONIC MANES AFFECTED BY MANY IRISHMEN, AND HE DOES

NOT HESITATE TO BARK AT FRIENDS, UNDERLINGS OR HIS SON WHEN THEY NEED

HAIRCUTS .

SOME POLITICIANS CRITICIZE LEMASS FOR

BEING TOO MUCH OF A PRAGMATIST . " HE'S A BIT OF A FLY-BOY, " SAID

LABOR PARTY LEADER JAMES LARKIN . " HE TRIMS HIS SAILS TO DIFFERENT

WINDS . " THE GREATEST CHALLENGE THAT LEMASS HAS TO FACE AS A

POLITICIAN IS TO REVITALIZE DRAB, UNIMAGINATIVE FIANNA FAIL, MANY OF

WHOSE FRONT-BENCH HEROES OF DESTINY HAVE BEEN AROUND SINCE DEV FIRST

CAME TO OFFICE . SEVEN OF THE 13 MEMBERS OF THE LEMASS CABINET ARE 60

OR UNDER, WHICH IS A RELATIVELY GREEN AGE IN IRISH POLITICS BUT HARDLY

GREEN ENOUGH . THOUGH HE HAS LITTLE OF THE PERSONAL MAGNETISM OF OLD

SPELLBINDER DEV, THE QUIET MAN'S DRIVE TO GET IRELAND INTO THE WORLD'S

MARKETS AND FORUMS HAS ATTRACTED SOME OF THE BRIGHT, RESTIVE YOUNG

IRISHMEN WHO ARE SHOWING A REVIVAL OF INTEREST IN POLITICS . TOTAL

EFFORT . LEMASS' MOST BRUISING DISAPPOINTMENT IN OFFICE WAS CHARLES DE

GAULLE'S REJECTION OF BRITISH MEMBERSHIP IN THE COMMON MARKET LAST YEAR

. DETERMINED TO TAKE IRELAND INTO EUROPE ALONGSIDE BRITAIN, LEMASS HAD

ALREADY STARTED WHITTLING TARIFF BARRIERS TO GIVE IRELAND'S OLDER AND

MOST COSSETED INDUSTRIES A WHIFF OF THE COLD COMPETITIVE WIND OUTSIDE .

TO CLEAR THE WAY FOR IRELAND'S ENTRY, WHICH HE NOW BELIEVES CANNOT COME

BEFORE 1970, LEMASS HAS UNEQUIVOCALLY COMMITTED HIS NATION, WHICH HAS

9,000 MEN UNDER ARMS, TO SUPPORT OF NATO POLICIES . IN 1949, AT NATO'S

FOUNDING,THE GOVERNMENT DECLINED MEMBERSHIP WITH THE LEGALISTIC

ARGUMENT THAT TO JOIN AN ALLIANCE WITH BRITAIN WOULD BE TANTAMOUNT TO

RECOGNITION OF ULSTER, WHOSE EXISTENCE THE REPUBLIC HAS NEVER ACCEPTED

. TO LEMASS, BY CONTRAST, ONE OF THE MOST COMPELLING MOTIVES FOR SEEING

BRITAIN AND IRELAND INSIDE THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY IS THE VERY PROSPECT

THAT IRELAND WOULD THEREBY TAKE A STEP CLOSER TO REUNIFICATION .

AUTOMATIC DISMANTLING OF THEIR MUTUAL TARIFF BARRIERS UNDER COMMON

MARKET RULES, SAYS LEMASS, WOULD FINALLY NECESSITATE A DEGREE OF

COOPERATION BETWEEN PROTESTANT AND CATHOLIC IRELAND . INSTEAD OF THE

PRESENT PROLONGED FARCE OF NONRECOGNITION NEITHER COUNTRY WILL EVEN

PERMIT EXTRADITION OF CRIMINALS BY THE OTHER AND CONTINUED STAGNATION

OF ULSTER'S ECONOMY, LEMASS FORESEES " A TOTAL NATIONAL EFFORT IN WHICH

OLD DIFFERENCES AND ANIMOSITIES CAN BE FORGOTTEN . " ALL THE DETAILS .

THE GOVERNMENT'S EAGERNESS TO RAISE IRELAND'S " GREEN CURTAIN, " AS

LEMASS CALLS IT, REFLECTS A GROWING COSMOPOLITANISM IN THE UNIVERSITIES

AND POPULATION CENTERS . THE IRISH HAVE MADE EXECUTIVES AND TECHNICIANS

FROM MORE THAN A DOZEN COUNTRIES RESOUNDINGLY WELCOME . THEY CHEERED

MIGHTILY FOR SCHOOLGIRL HARUMI SUZUKI, EIGHT-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER OF A

JAPANESE PLANT MANAGER AT SHANNON, WHEN SHE CARRIED OFF FIRST AND THIRD

PRIZES FOR IRISH POETRY AND GAELIC RECITATION . YOUNG IRELAND'S

HORIZONS ARE BEING BROADENED BY THE FOREIGN STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN

FLOCKING TO IRISH UNIVERSITIES, WHERE THEY COMPRISE NEARLY 17 PER CENT

OF TOTAL ENROLLMENT ; MOST COME FROM AFRO-ASIAN COUNTRIES, WHERE THE

DISTINCTIVE ACCENT OF EX-COLONIAL, NONALIGNED DUBLIN HAS BECOME

SOMETHING OF A STATUS SYMBOL . THE VISITING STUDENTS, IN TURN, HAVE

GENERATED NEW INTEREST IN LANGUAGE AND HISTORY COURSES AMONG THEIR

IRISH FRIENDS . THE ULTRACONSERVATIVE ROMAN CATHOLIC CLERGY STILL

HEAVILY CENSORS THE ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT . AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER,

MANY OF THE BEST NATIVE AUTHORS HAVE BEEN BANNED FROM LIBRARIES,

INCLUDING WORKS BY GEORGE MOORE, LIAM O'FLAHERTY, O'CASEY, FRANK

O'CONNOR, SHAW, BRENDAN BEHAN . BUT THINGS ARE EASING UP A LITTLE .

CINEMATIC SEX HAS BECOME SO MUCH SEXIER AND MORE FREQUENT, EXPLAINS

JUSTICE MINISTER HAUGHEY, THAT THE CENSORS HAVE BEEN TOLD TO GO EASY

WITH THE SCISSORS, " OR ELSE OUR CINEMAS WON'T GET ANY FILMS AT ALL . "

ANOTHER SIGN OF THE NEW LIBERALITY IS A SCHEDULED VISIT BY THE BOLSHOI

BALLET TO DUBLIN THIS MONTH, FOR IRISH MISTRUST OF THE INTRIGUOUS

RUSSIANS IS SO KEEN THAT THEY HAVE YET TO RECOGNIZE THE 45-YEAR-OLD

SOVIET GOVERNMENT .

TELEVISION, WHICH NOW LIGHTS UP MORE THAN 200,000

SCREENS, IS A PERENNIAL ASSAULT ON GAELIC PURITANISM . IRELAND'S OWN

STATION COMPETES WITH PROGRAMS BEAMED FROM BRITAIN THAT SEEM INCREDIBLY

RISQUE TO IRISH VIEWERS ; THE BBC'S UNINHIBITED COVERAGE OF CHRISTINE

KEELER'S EXPLOITS HAS EVEN JOGGED THE STODGY, SELF-CENSORING IRISH

PRESS INTO GIVING READERS ALL THE DETAILS . MANY IRISHMEN, INCREASINGLY

RESENTFUL OF CENSORSHIP, HAVE TAKEN TO SAMPLING CENSORED BOOKS, FILMS

OR PLAYS BY TAKING THE 90-MINUTE FLIGHT TO LONDON WHERE FAR MORE

HORRENDOUS TEMPTATIONS ABOUND . REBELS & MONARCHS . THE IRISH HAVE

WRITTEN SOME OF THE TENDEREST LOVE LYRICS IN ENGLISH LITERATURE, BUT IN

THEIR ACTUAL CONTACT WITH THE OPPOSITE SEX, IRISHMEN SOMETIMES RESEMBLE

COLOMBIA'S KOGI INDIANS, WHO, DESPISING WOMEN, SPEND ALL THEIR TIME

DISCUSSING PHILOSOPHY WITH OTHER MALES AND CHEWING COCOA LEAVES TO COOL

OFF THE SEXUAL URGES . AN ACID AXIOM AMONG IRISH GIRLS RUNS : " PUT AN

IRISH FELLER IN A ROOM WITH A GIRL AND TWO BOTTLES OF STOUT, AND HE'LL

PICK THE STOUT ANY TIME . " MANY EXPLANATIONS HAVE BEEN OFFERED FOR HIS

SEEMING MISOGYNY : THE EPIC SUSPICION THAT WAR AND THE GODS ARE MORE

IMPORTANT THAN MERE LOVE ; THE RELENTLESS EMOTIONAL DOMINANCE OF IRISH

MOTHERS OVER IRISH SONS ; THE ODDLY PURITANICAL STREAK IN IRISH

CATHOLICISM ; ABOVE ALL, THE HERITAGE OF HARDSHIP THAT GIVES THE IRISH

A MORTAL TERROR OF INSECURITY AND ENCOURAGES THEM TO STAY CELIBATE . AT

LEAST SOME OF THESE FACTORS ARE CHANGING, AND THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE

SEXES SEEM LESS SELF-CONSCIOUS AND AT TIMES DOWNRIGHT FRIENDLY . THE

IRISH NOW WED YOUNGER ; THE AVERAGE MARRIAGE AGE DROPPED FROM NEARLY

35 FOR MEN IN 1929 TO JUST OVER 30, FROM 29 FOR WOMEN TO JUST UNDER 27

. FOR THE YOUNG, ONE OF THE MOST JOYOUS INNOVATIONS IN RECENT YEARS HAS

BEEN A PROLIFERATION OF DANCE HALLS, WHICH HAVE REACHED SCORES OF SMALL

COMMUNITIES, AND A BURGEONING OF BANDS " 200 IN ALL THAT KEEP THE OULD

SOD JUMPING WITH HIPPETYHOPPETY JAZZ AND CARRY SUCH INTRIGUING NAMES AS

REBELS, JETS, MONARCHS . UNLIKE THE OLD DAYS, WHEN THE LOCAL PRIEST

WOULD OFTEN DISPERSE A COUNTRY CEILIDH AT SUNDOWN, DANCE-HALL HOURS ARE

REGULATED BY MAGISTRATES, WHO TEND TO BE MORE LIBERAL . AND, AS ALWAYS,

THE WESTERN WORLD HAS ITS PLAYBOYS . IN LONDON, WHERE ONE IN EIGHT

BIRTHS IS ILLEGITIMATE, AUTHORITIES REPORT THAT A DISPROPORTIONATE

NUMBER OF UNWED PEGEENS COME OVER TO HAVE THEIR BABIES FREE ON

BRITAIN'S NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE .

THE MOST CONSPICUOUS VICE OF THE IRISH IN TIMES

PAST HAS BEEN " THE DRINK . " TODAY, THOUGH THE PUBS KEEP LONGER HOURS

AND MOST IRISHMEN CAN AFFORD TO DRINK MORE, PUBLIC DRUNKENNESS IS NO

LONGER THE COMMON SPECTACLE IT USED TO BE, AND BAREFOOT BOYS NO LONGER

TROT THROUGH CITY STREETS BEARING JUGS OF FOAMING SOUT OR BOTTLES OF

BRANDY HOME TO DAD . THE YOUNGER GENERATION SEEMS TO BE MORE SOBER THAN

ITS PARENTS . ALSO, ALCOHOLIC HABITS ARE CHANGING : MORE DRINKING IS

DONE AT HOME NOWADAYS ; COCKTAILS AND HARD LIQUOR ARE CUTTING INTO

BEER CONSUMPTION ; AND MANY PUBS, WHICH HAD LONG BEEN JEALOUSLY

GUARDED MALE PRESERVES, HAVE OPENED " SINGING LOUNGES " WHERE AN

IRISHMAN CAN TAKE HIS WIFE OR GIRL . THE IMAGE OF THE BOOZY,

BELLIGERENT IRISHMAN CONDEMNED AS SHEER HOSTILE PROPAGANDA BY SEAN

LEMASS DIES HARD, NONETHELESS . INDEED, DRUNK OR SOBER, FEW PEOPLE ON

EARTH CAN RAISE A GLASS WITH GREATER GUSTO OR STYLE . RADIANT GOALS .

IRELAND FACES MANY MORE URGENT PROBLEMS . THE COUNTRY IS STILL

CRITICALLY SHORT OF MODERN HOUSING ; HUNDREDS OF ONCE ELEGANT GEORGIAN

MANSIONS IN DUBLIN HAVE FOR YEARS HELD SOME OF EUROPE'S MOST SQUALID

SLUMS . WHILE THE GOVERNMENT HAS SUCCEEDED IN EASING IRELAND'S

HISTORICALLY HARSH SYSTEM OF FARM LEASING, NEARLY 1,000,000 OF THE

COUNTRY'S 11 MILLION ACRES OF AGRICULTURAL LAND ARE STILL COVERED BY

ELEVEN-MONTH LEASES, WHICH DISCOURAGE TENANTS AND OWNERS ALIKE FROM

IMPROVING THE LAND (AFTER TWELVE MONTHS ON A FARM, AN IRISH TENANT HAS

A LEGAL CLAIM TO BUY IT) . THOUGH 45 ACRES OF GOOD LAND ARE THE

ACCEPTED MINIMUM FOR A VIABLE FARM, THERE ARE STILL 208,000 FARMS (OF

360,000) WITH LESS THAN 30 ACRES EACH . IN THE POOR WESTERN COUNTIES,

ONE IN THREE FARMS IS STILL LESS THAN 15 ACRES, AND SONS GROW OLD

WAITING FOR FATHERS TO DIE . THOUGH SEAN LEMASS IS OFTEN CHIDED IN

PARLIAMENT FOR FOOT-DRAGGING ON HOUSING AND FARM REFORM, MOST OF THE

NATION'S PROBLEMS ARE A LONGTIME LEGACY OF NATIONAL POVERTY AND

POLITICAL TIMIDITY . WHAT IS RADIANTLY DIFFERENT ABOUT IRELAND TODAY IS

THE SERIOUS EXPECTATION THAT ITS ILLS AND LAGS WILL IN FACT BE

CORRECTED . LEMASS WILL SOON RELEASE DETAILS OF A NEW SIX-YEAR ECONOMIC

PROGRAM THAT AIMS TO BOOST THE G.N.P . 50 PER CENT BY 1970 . IF IT

SUCCEEDS AND HIS GOALS IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN SET FAR SHORT OF ACTUAL

PERFORMANCE THE NATION WILL HAVE TRAVELED A LONG WAY FROM " THE

UNFORTUNATE COUNTRY " OF IRELAND'S ANCIENT LAMENT . THE VARIED AND

LIVELY VIRTUES OF THE IRISH, WHICH IN THE PAST HAVE OFTEN SHADED INTO

WEAKNESSES WHEN THEY WERE NOT VIGOROUSLY APPLIED TO A CAUSE, ARE THE

NATION'S BEST ASSURANCE THAT IT CAN FIND THE FUTURE IT SEEKS FOR ITSELF

. HOWEVER BRIGHT THE GOAL, IRELAND WILL STILL BE MANY LIGHTYEARS AWAY

FROM THE BLEST ISLE . BUT WHO KNOWS ? THEY MAY HAVE THEIR TROUBLES

THERE TOO .

COLD WAR TO MOSCOW, WITH CAUTION THE PATTERN OF ARRIVAL AND

DEPARTURE MIGHT BE SYMBOLIC . BY WEEK'S END EVERYONE IN MOSCOW BELIEVED

THAT THE RED CHINESE DELEGATION WAS READY TO HEAD HOME BEFORE TOO LONG

. AT THE SAME TIME, U.S . AND BRITISH DELEGATIONS WERE DUE TO ARRIVE .

THE RUSSIANS WERE JAMMING RADIO PEKING BUT LET THE VOICE OF AMERICA

COME IN LOUD AND CLEAR . FACED WITH THE OPEN CHINESE CHALLENGE TO

SOVIET LEADERSHIP OF WORLD COMMUNISM, NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV MAY WANT TO

EASE TENSIONS WITH THE WEST, BOTH TO BULWARK HIS POSITION AT HOME AND

TO DEMONSTRATE THE GENUINENESS OF HIS MUCH-HERALDED COEXISTENCE POLICY

ABROAD . BUT WHETHER KHRUSHCHEV WANTS IT BADLY ENOUGH TO MAKE SOME

REALLY MEANINGFUL CONCESSIONS IS STILL ANOTHER QUESTION . THE ISSUES .

AS HE FLEW OFF TO MOSCOW FOR ANOTHER ROUND OF TEST-BAN TALKS,

PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY AVERELL HARRIMAN NOTED HOPEFULLY THAT RUSSIA WAS

BEING MORE PLEASANT IN " THE SMALL THINGS OF LIFE . " AS FOR THE BIG

THINGS, " WE ARE GOING IN GOOD FAITH AND IN THE HOPE OF ACHIEVING SOME

STEPS THAT WILL BE BENEFICIAL . " THE PRINCIPAL ISSUES FACING HARRIMAN

AND HIS FELLOW NEGOTIATOR, BRITISH MINISTER OF SCIENCE VISCOUNT

HAILSHAM, IN MOSCOW . . .TEST BAN : KHRUSHCHEV HAS INDICATED THAT HE

WOULD REVIVE RUSSIA'S 1961 TERMS FOR A TEST BAN, WHICH INCLUDED A

VOLUNTARY MORATORIUM ON UNDERGROUND DETONATIONS, WITHOUT EFFECTIVE

CONTROLS . THIS PROPOSAL WAS REJECTED BY THE U.S . AT . THE TIME .

THEN, LAST YEAR, RUSSIA OFFERED

TO PERMIT THREE INSPECTIONS OF ITS TERRITORY YEARLY BY WAY OF POLICING

AN UNDERGROUND BAN . MOSCOW SUBSEQUENTLY RENEGED, KHRUSHCHEV NOW

INSISTS THAT RUSSIA WILL NEVER " OPEN ITS DOOR TO NATO SPIES, " AND

THAT " THIS IS NO SUBJECT FOR BARGAINING . " THE WEST WILL NOT ACCEPT

AN UNENFORCEABLE MORATORIUM ON UNDERGROUND TESTS, SINCE IT BELIEVES

THAT THE RUSSIANS WOULD BREAK IT AT WILL, AS THEY VIOLATED THE

VOLUNTARY TEST BAN IN 1961 . HOWEVER, IF RUSSIA AGREES TO A TREATY THAT

SIMPLY FORBIDS TESTS IN THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH ARE EASILY DETECTABLE THE

WEST IS WILLING TO TAKE UP THE PROBLEM OF UNDERGROUND TESTING AT A

LATER DATE . .NONAGGRESSION PACT . KHRUSHCHEV DECLARED THAT " AT THE

CONCLUSION OF A TESTBAN AGREEMENT, " HE WILL REVIVE RUSSIA'S HOARY

DEMAND FOR A NONAGGRESSION PACT BETWEEN THE 15 NATO POWERS AND THE

SATELLITE NATIONS OF THE WARSAW TREATY . IN THE PAST, THIS PROPOSAL HAS

INVARIABLY BEEN REJECTED BY THE WEST BECAUSE WEST GERMANY AND FRANCE

OBJECT THAT IT WOULD IMPLY WESTERN ACCEPTANCE OF A DIVIDED EUROPE AND

RECOGNITION OF EAST GERMANY . IN ANY CASE, THEY POINT OUT, NO SUCH

DECLARATION IS NEEDED, FOR NATO'S DEFENSIVE PURPOSES WERE GUARANTEED IN

ITS CHARTER 14 YEARS AGO . THE PROSPECTS . U.S . POLICYMAKERS EMPHASIZE

THAT A TEST-BAN TREATY WOULD HAVE LITTLE IF ANY EFFECT ON THE BALANCE

OF POWER . SINCE BOTH EAST AND WEST HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH NUCLEAR

WARHEADS FOR ANY CONCEIVABLE CONFLICT, THE ONLY WAY EITHER SIDE COULD

GAIN A DECISIVE STRATEGIC LEAD WOULD BE THROUGH A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH IN

MISSILE DELIVERY SYSTEMS, WHICH WOULD NOT BE COVERED BY THE TEST BAN .

IN ANY CASE, NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY IS NOW SO ADVANCED THAT WEAPONS SUCH AS

THE ANTI-MISSILE MISSILE CAN BE DEVELOPED ENTIRELY IN THE LABORATORY .

FURTHERMORE, NO WESTERN STATESMAN BELIEVES THAT A TEST-BAN AGREEMENT

WILL RESTRAIN THE FRENCH OR CHINESE FROM TESTING NUCLEAR WEAPONS AT

WILL, OR EVEN SLOW THE SPREAD OF NUCLEAR ARMS TO OTHER NATIONS . WHY,

THEN, IS THE WEST SO EAGER TO SIGN A NUCLEAR PACT WITH RUSSIA ?

RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY, WASHINGTON HAS COME TO VIEW A TEST-BAN TREATY AS

THE TOUCHSTONE OF SOVIET INTENTIONS . IF THIS ONE OUTSTANDING ISSUE CAN

BE RESOLVED AFTER FIVE YEARS OF FRUSTRATION, THE STATE DEPARTMENT

BELIEVES, THEN THERE IS HOPE THAT EAST AND WEST MAY ULTIMATELY BE ABLE

TO SETTLE OTHER ISSUES . THOUGH HARRIMAN IS EMPOWERED ONLY TO NEGOTIATE

A TEST-BAN AGREEMENT, HE EXPECTS TO " EXPLORE " OTHER COLD WAR

PROBLEMS, SUCH AS BERLIN AND RUSSIA'S FAILURE TO ENFORCE THE LAOTIAN

NEUTRALITY PACT . ON THOSE MATTERS KHRUSHCHEV SO FAR DID NOT APPEAR TO

BUDGE . TALKING TO BELGIUM'S FOREIGN MINISTER PAUL-HENRI SPAAK IN KIEV

LAST WEEK, KHRUSHCHEV SAID : " BERLIN IS THE FOOT THAT KENNEDY HAS IN

EUROPE . EVERY TIME I WANT TO, I'LL STAMP ON IT . " IN SHORT, THE

EAST-WEST TALKS IN MOSCOW MAY JUST POSSIBLY PROVE NO MORE FRUITFUL THAN

THE SINO-SOVIET TALKS . BUT U.S . OBSERVERS STILL WONDER HOW LONG

KHRUSHCHEV CAN GO ON FIGHTING A TWOFRONT WAR, REFUSING BOTH CONCESSIONS

TO PEKING AND A GENUINE MOVE TOWARD " PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE " WITH THE

WEST .

COMMUNISTS WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR SCARCELY HAD THE SINO-SOVIET TALKS

GOTTEN UNDERWAY THAN THE MEETING HEADED FOR COLLAPSE . IT DID NOT MUCH

MATTER WHEN RED CHINA'S SEVEN-MAN DELEGATION WOULD PACK THEIR BAGS AND

ACTUALLY LEAVE MOSCOW ; BACK HOME PEKING'S PEOPLE'S DAILY SEEMED READY

TO CALL IT QUITS . " WE WANT UNITY, NOT A SPLIT, " SAID THE VOICE OF

RED CHINA . " BUT WE HAVE TO POINT OUT WITH HEAVY HEARTS THAT EVENTS

HAVE GONE CONTRARY TO OUR HOPES . THE SITUATION IS VERY GRAVE . "

ABSOLUTE SECRECY . ALL WEEK THERE HAD BEEN A STRANGE SENSATION IN

MOSCOW THAT MAYBE THERE WAS NO SINO-SOVIET MEETING AT ALL . THE KREMLIN

ACTED AS THOUGH THE SHOWDOWN NEVER TOOK PLACE . DOM PRIEMOV, THE

RECEPTION HOUSE WHERE THE SESSIONS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE HELD, WAS

CAREFULLY AVOIDED BY SOVIET REPORTERS AND PHOTOGRAPHERS . ASKED WHY, A

MOSCOW NEWS EXECUTIVE SAID SARCASTICALLY : " IT'S PAYDAY . THEY'VE ALL

GONE FOR THEIR MONEY . " AFTER MEETING TWICE TO DISCUSS FORMALITIES,

THE RUSSIANS AND RED CHINESE MET ONLY THREE TIMES DURING THE NEXT SEVEN

DAYS . JUST BEFORE ONE SESSION BEGAN, A WESTERN REPORTER ASKED A SOVIET

PLAINCLOTHESMAN WHAT TIME THE PEKING DELEGATION WAS EXPECTED . THE COP

SHRUGGED AND SAID : " YOU NEVER KNOW WITH THEM . THEY ARE A VERY

DISORGANIZED PEOPLE . WE WAITED FOR THEM YESTERDAY, AND THEY NEVER DID

SHOW UP . " THE RED CHINESE DELEGATION APPARENTLY SPENT MOST OF ITS

TIME DRIVING THROUGH THE LENIN HILLS SECTION OF THE CITY IN BLACK

LIMOUSINES, SHUTTLING MYSTERIOUSLY FROM PEKING'S EMBASSY TO DOM PRIEMOV

TO THE VILLA WHERE THEY LIVED . WESTERN NEWSMEN ONCE GLIMPSED TENG

HSIAO-PING, THE LEADER OF PEKING'S GROUP, SERENELY STROLLING THROUGH

THE VILLA'S GARDENS . THE ONLY SIGN OF LIFE BEHIND THE MASSIVE,

CREAM-COLORED WALLS OF DOM PRIEMOV WERE THE BOOTS OF A SOVIET SOLDIER,

WHICH PROTRUDED BENEATH THE SPIKED IRON GATES WHEN HE OPENED A PEEPHOLE

TO SCRUTINIZE AN ARRIVING AUTOMOBILE . FOR THE FIRST TIME, RUSSIANS

WERE WILLING TO TALK AND EVEN TO JOKE ABOUT THE SINO-SOVIET CONFLICT .

ONE CRACK MAKING THE ROUNDS IN MOSCOW SUGGESTED THAT THE WAY TO SOLVE

THE WHOLE THING WAS FOR MAO TSE-TUNG AND CHARLES DE GAULLE TO CONCLUDE

AN ALLIANCE, THUS LETTING THE TWO TROUBLEMAKERS TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER

. ABSOLUTE EQUALITY . TRHOUGHOUT THE ON-AND-OFF MEETINGS, THE

IDEOLOGICAL FIRE CONTINUED ABOVE THE HEADS OF THE DELEGATES . THE

KREMLIN SPLASHED A POLICY STATEMENT ON THE FRONT PAGE OF PRAVDA THAT

OMINOUSLY WARNED PEKING OF THE " DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCES " OF ITS POLICY

. AS FOR NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV, HE CALLED OUT THE BRASS BANDS, HONOR GUARD

AND TELEVISION CAMERAS TO WELCOME HUNGARY'S JANOS KADAR, WHO REPAID THE

FLATTERY BY ONCE AGAIN BACKING MOSCOW'S LINE OF PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE .

RED CHINA, WHOSE DELEGATION'S ARRIVAL IN MOSCOW WAS DOWNPLAYED BY THE

SOVIET GOVERNMENT AND DELIBERATELY IGNORED BY THE SOVIET PRESS, FIRED

ITS OWN VOLLEY OF INSULTS . FOR THE FIRST TIME, PEKING CLAIMED ABSOLUTE

EQUALITY WITH THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF THE SOVIET UNION AND WARNED THE

KREMLIN IN AN ELABORATE SIMILE : " NO GENUINE UNITY CAN BE ACHIEVED BY

AN ATTITUDE THAT ALLOWS THE MAGISTRATE TO BURN DOWN HOUSES, WHILE

FORBIDDING THE COMMON PEOPLE EVEN TO LIGHT THEIR LAMPS . " ALL THESE

SINO-SOVIET EXCHANGES WERE CAREFULLY FRAMED TO PUT THE BLAME FOR THE

SPLIT ON THE OTHER FELLOW . OBVIOUSLY THE CHINESE NEVER EXPECTED THE

MOSCOW MEETING TO SUCCEED, INSISTED ON IT MERELY TO EMBARRASS THE

SOVIETS . THE KREMLIN, IN TURN, COULD NOT AFFORD TO APPEAR INTRACTABLE

. AT WEEK'S END THE PEKING PRESS SUGGESTED THAT PERHAPS A FEW OF THE

SINO-SOVIET DIFFERENCES COULD BE SETTLED SOON, WHILE OTHERS COULD BE

DEFERRED TILL LATER . THIS SIMPLY MEANT THAT THE CHINESE WERE READY TO

PROLONG THE QUARREL INDEFINITELY . " IF THE DIFFERENCES CANNOT BE

RESOLVED THIS YEAR, " SAID PEKING BLANDLY, " THEY CAN WAIT UNTIL NEXT

YEAR . " THE RUSSIANS ARE LESS PATIENT . THEY SHOT BACK AN ANSWERING

COMMUNIQUE WARNING PEKING THAT " THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE " WILL DECIDE

WHETHER THE SPLIT WILL WIDEN . THEN MOSCOW GAVE THE RED CHINESE AND THE

WEST A POINTED REMINDER . AFTER ALL, SAID THE SOVIETS, " WE HAVE A

COMMON ENEMY . /

ESPIONAGE MIDSUMMER DRAGNET THROUGHOUT THE WORLD LAST WEEK,

SECRET AGENTS WERE ON THE MOVE MANY OF THEM IN THE DIRECTION OF JAIL .

THE U.S . HAD JUST ROUNDED UP ITS FOURTH OF JULY CATCH ; WEST GERMANY

WAS TRYING THREE SPIES WHO HAD PENETRATED ITS SUPPOSEDLY IMPENETRABLE

GEHLEN INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION (SEE FOLLOWING STORY) ; AND BRITAIN

HAD TWO SPY THRILLERS RUNNING CONCURRENTLY . DEFEATED MACHINERY . ON

TRIAL IN LONDON, ITALIAN-BORN ATOMIC PHYSICIST GIUSEPPE MARTELLI TRIED

TO EXPLAIN AWAY HIS POSSESSION OF HOLLOW-HEELED SHOES SUITABLE FOR

CONCEALING MICROFILM, CIGARETTE PACKS CONTAINING THIN, INFLAMMABLE

MESSAGE PADS, SHEETS OF RENDEZVOUS INSTRUCTIONS, A HIGH-POWERED CAMERA,

AND A SUPER-STRENGTH RADIO RECEIVER . HE HAD ACCEPTED ALL THESE GADGETS

FROM THE RUSSIANS, HE SAID, ONLY TO STRING THEM ALONG AND THEN DENOUNCE

THEM AT THE RIGHT TIME TO THE BRITISH AUTHORITIES . ASKED THE JUDGE :

/ YOU FELT THAT YOU COULD DEFEAT THE WHOLE MACHINERY OF SOVIET

INTELLIGENCE ? " AND, ALSO IN LONDON, ONE OF THE ODDEST OF THE SPY

CASES CAME TO LIGHT WHEN THE GOVERNMENT ADMITTED THAT IT WAS GRANTING

ASYLUM TO ANATOLY DOLNYTSIN, A FORMER SENIOR RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE

OFFICER WHO DEFECTED TO THE WEST 18 MONTHS AGO, AND HAD SPENT THE

INTERVENING TIME BEING THOROUGHLY PUMPED BY U.S . AND BRITISH AGENTS .

ONE REPORTED RESULT : THE REVELATION THAT BRITISH NEWSMAN H.A.R .

PHILBY WAS INDEED THE " THIRD MAN " WHO ENABLED SPIES BURGESS AND

MACLEAN TO ESCAPE ARREST AND FLEE TO RUSSIA IN 1951 . LAST WINTER

PHILBY, TOO, SLIPPED BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN JUST AHEAD OF PURSUING

MI-5 AGENTS . ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT HAD MADE QUITE A SHOW OF ASKING

THE BRITISH PRESS NOT TO PRINT THE STORY, THE AUTHORITIES HAD IN FACT

LEAKED IT . LABORITES CHARGED THAT THIS POSSIBLY ENDANGERED DOLNYTSIN,

WHO IS SOMEWHERE IN A BRITISH HIDEOUT, AND THAT DOLNYTSIN WAS BEING

UNVEILED NOW BY MACMILLAN'S GOVERNMENT IN THE HOPE OF CLAIMING A SPY

SUCCESS AFTER SO MANY SECURITY DISASTERS . FINGERED SPIES . SO MANY RED

SPIES ARE CAUGHT, PROBABLY BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY MORE OF THEM

AROUND. THE U.S . STATE DEPARTMENT ESTIMATES THAT THE COMMUNIST

NATIONS EMPLOY MORE THAN 300,000 TRAINED AGENTS, WHO ARE HELPED IN

THEIR PRYING BY THE " LEGAL " SPIES ATTACHED TO THE 46 SOVIET EMBASSIES

AND LEGATIONS IN THE FREE WORLD . (THE U.S . OPERATES WITH A CRACK

CORPS OF AGENTS ONLY ABOUT ONE-FIFTH AS LARGE.) BUT WHY WERE SO MANY

RED SPIES COMING TO LIGHT AT ONCE ? WHENEVER ONE GREAT POWER HAS A

BIG ESPIONAGE ROUNDUP, AS RUSSIA DID LAST MAY IN THE TRIAL OF RUSSIAN

SCIENTIST OLEG PENKOVSKY, WHO TURNED OUT TO BE A LONGTIME WESTERN

AGENT, SPIES ELSEWHERE BRACE THEMSELVES FOR A PERIOD OF ROUGH WEATHER .

FURTHERMORE, THERE IS A SEASONAL FACTOR INVOLVED ; SUMMER IS THE

TRADITIONAL TIME TO PUT THE FINGER ON SPIES . AROUND THE END OF JUNE,

MANY COMMUNIST " DIPLOMATS " PREPARE TO GO HOME FOR VACATIONS AND NEW

INSTRUCTIONS . HAVING HAD AN EYE ON THEM ALREADY, THE FBI THEN OFTEN

DECIDES TO POUNCE AND EXPOSE THEM BEFORE THEY CAN BE REASSIGNED .

NATIVE PASSION . ONE FACT TO EMERGE FROM THE RECENT WAVE OF ARRESTS IS

THAT THE SOVIET APPARATUS SEEMS SENTIMENTALLY FOND OF SUCH OLD

CLOAK-AND-DAGGER STANDBYS AS FALSE BOTTOMS IN VALISES, HIDDEN

COMPARTMENTS IN TALCUM-POWDER CANS AND TOOTHPASTE TUBES, AND

FLASHLIGHTS WITH MESSAGE CHAMBERS INSTEAD OF BATTERIES . A RUSSIAN

SPY'S RESIDENCE USUALLY HAS AS MANY TRAP DOORS, HOLLOW BEAMS, FALSE

WALLS, SECRET PASSAGES AND DOUBLE- AND TRIPLE-LOCKED DOORS AS A GRADE B

HORROR MOVIE . ACTUALLY, AGENTS BOTH EAST AND WEST HAVE BENEFITED

ENORMOUSLY FROM FAR MORE MODERN DEVICES . IT IS NOW POSSIBLE TO

EAVESDROP ON A CONVERSATION HELD IN THE MIDDLE OF AN EMPTY PRAIRIE BY

SIMPLY POINTING A BEAM OF LIGHT FROM 500 YARDS AWAY . NEW CAMERAS CAN

TAKE PICTURES IN TOTAL DARKNESS WITHOUT THE USE OF INFRA-RED LIGHT .

FINELY GROUND LENSES CAN ZOOM IN FROM BLOCKS AWAY TO PICK UP THE FINE

PRINT ON AN INSURANCE POLICY . BUT THE SOVIETS LIKE THE MORE

OLD-FASHIONED AND ROMANTIC GADGETS, MOSTLY, IT SEEMS, FROM A NATIVE

PASSION FOR MELODRAMA .

RECENTLY NABBED RED AGENTS INCLUDE SWEDEN'S EX-MILITARY

ATTACHE STIG WENNERSTROM ; RUSSIA'S IVAN EGEROV AND WIFE, ATTACHED TO

THE U.N . SECRETARIAT ; TWO UNIDENTIFIED RUSSIANS CAUGHT IN WASHINGTON

USING THE NAMES AND PAPERS OF INNOCENT LIVING AMERICANS, AS WELL AS A

BRITISH CORPORAL, A FRENCH NAVAL RESERVIST, A UMAN AND HALF A DOZEN

RUSSIAN,  RUMANIAN AND CZECH DIPLOMATS .

TRIPLE DOUBLE WITH SOME 125 EAST-BLOC AGENTS ARRESTED EVERY

MONTH IN THEIR DIVIDED COUNTRY, GERMANS ARE BLASE ABOUT SPY STORIES .

BUT THE CASE THAT UNFOLDED IN A KARLSRUHE COURTROOM LAST WEEK PROVED

THAT BONN'S VAUNTED GEHLEN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE HAD BEEN INFILTRATED

FOR TEN YEARS BY THE REDS, AND THAT THE ORGANIZATION HAD KNOWINGLY

HIRED FORMER NAZIS . ALL THREE OF THE MEN ON TRIAL, LONGTIME EMPLOYEES

OF GEHLEN, WERE ALSO LONGTIME EMPLOYEES OF THE SOVIET UNION . BY ALL

ODDS, IT WAS THE MOST EMBARRASSING SPY SCANDAL TO HIT WEST GERMANY

SINCE THE WAR . " I HATE AMERICANS . " EX-WEHRMACHT GENERAL REINHARD

GEHLEN, WHO IS AS SECRETIVE AS ANY OF HIS 5,000 MEN (HIS LAST KNOWN

PHOTOGRAPH DATES FROM 1944), SET UP HIS OUTFIT IN 1947 WITH THE

COOPERATION OF THE CIA . IT WAS STAFFED LARGELY WITH VETERAN AGENTS WHO

GOT THEIR TRAINING UNDER THE NAZIS, ALTHOUGH GEHLEN HIMSELF HAD NEVER

JOINED THE NAZI PARTY . IN 1955 THE GEHLEN APPARATUS WAS TURNED OVER

FROM CIA CONTROL TO THE WEST GERMAN GOVERNMENT ; IT REPORTS DIRECTLY

TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE, HAS A TOP SECRET BUDGET . YET IN COURT, THE

THREE MEN WHO PENETRATED ITS WALLED-IN MUNICH HEADQUARTERS MADE THE

FEAT SOUND ABOUT AS DIFFICULT AS JOINING A BAVARIAN MARCHING AND

GYMNASTIC SOCIETY . FIRST OF THE TRIO TO FACE THE FIVE REDROBED JUDGES

AT KARLSRUHE WAS STOCKY HANS CLEMENS, 61, WHO PEERED WITH INTEREST AT

AN EXHIBIT TABLE COVERED WITH THE TOOLS OF HIS TRADE : CAMERAS, TAPE

RECORDERS, MICROSCOPES, RADIOS, FILMS AND SUITCASES WITH SECRET

COMPARTMENTS . AS HE TOLD IT, CLEMENS HAD BEEN A PIANIST AS A YOUTH IN

DRESDEN, BUT CHANGED KEYS AND BECAME A NAZI POLICE OFFICIAL IN 1933 .

HE HEADED THE DRESDEN OFFICE OF THE DREADED SS SECURITY SERVICE .

DURING WORLD WAR II HE COMMANDED AN EXECUTION SQUAD IN ITALY THAT

KILLED 330 HOSTAGES AND FOR HIS SAVAGERY WON THE TITLE " THE TIGER OF

COMO . " BACK IN GERMANY AFTER THE WAR, HE MET A COLONEL " MAX " OF

SOVIET INTELLIGENCE, WHO SUGGESTED THAT HE GET A JOB WITH THE GEHLEN

ORGANIZATION . IT PROVED EASY . THE MOTIVE HE GAVE FOR BECOMING A

DOUBLE AGENT FOR THE REDS SEEMED LIKE AN OLD PROPAGANDA BROADCAST . " I

HATE AMERICANS LIKE THE PLAGUE, " HE SAID IN COURT, RECALLING THAT

AFTER AMERICAN AIR RAIDS ON DRESDEN HE HAD SWORN, " I SHALL REPAY THEM

DOUBLY AND TRIPLY . " CHAMPAGNE IN STREAMS . ONE MAJOR SERVICE CLEMENS

PERFORMED FOR THE RUSSIANS WAS TO RECRUIT A FORMER SS COLLEAGUE, HEINZ

FELFE . COOL AND ARTICULATE, DEFENDANT FELFE, 45, TOLD THE JUDGES THAT

HE TOO WAS AN ARDENT NAZI, HAD WORKED HIS WAY UP INTO HEINRICH

HIMMLER'S STATE SECURITY BUREAU . HE BRAGGED OF HIS WARTIME SUCCESSES,

WHICH HE CLAIMED INCLUDED GETTING FIRST REPORTS ON TEHERAN AND YALTA

FROM A CONFIDANT OF ALLEN DULLES . AFTER WAR'S END HE WAS CLASSIFIED BY

A GERMAN DENAZIFICATION BOARD AS UNBELASTET (NOT INCRIMINATED) . THIS

ASTONISHING FACT WAS ACKNOWLEDGED BY PRESIDING JUDGE KURT WEBER WITH AN

OUTRAGED " DONNERWETTER ! " (THUNDERATION) . IN 1947, JUST 18 MONTHS

AFTER FELFE'S RELEASE FROM A PRISONER-OF-WAR CAMP, HE FOUND SPY WORK

WITH THE BRITISH, CONTINUING WITH THEM UNTIL, AS HE PUT IT, THE BRITISH

/ RAN OUT OF MONEY . " THEN HIS OLD FRIEND CLEMENS MADE CONTACT WITH

HIM ON ORDERS FROM COLONEL " MAX, " ARRANGED A MEETING IN EAST BERLIN,

AT WHICH FELFE WAS HIRED TO WORK FOR THE SOVIETS . THE DEAL WAS

CLINCHED AT A DINNER AT MAX'S VILLA, WHERE THE TABLE " WAS PILED HIGH

WITH FOOD AND CHAMPAGNE POURED IN STREAMS . " NOT LONG AFTERWARD,

THANKS TO A RECOMMENDATION FROM HIS FRIEND CLEMENS, FELFE WAS OFFERED A

JOB IN THE GEHLEN SERVICE . " NOW, " HE SAID, " I WAS TO DANCE AT TWO

WEDDINGS, WITH THE RUSSIANS AND WITH GEHLEN . " FELFE DANCED UP FAST IN

GEHLEN'S RANKS, AND BY THE TIME OF HIS ARREST IN 1961 HAD BECOME A

DEPARTMENT HEAD IN THE COUNTER-ESPIONAGE DIVISION, SPECIALIZING IN

ANTI-SOVIET WORK . REWARDING INVESTMENT . THE WORRIEDLOOKING THIRD

MEMBER OF THE GROUP, ONE ERWIN TIEBEL, MERELY SERVED AS COURIER FOR

FELFE AND CLEMENS . THE SPIES TRANSMITTED THEIR INFORMATION BY

MICROFILM HIDDEN IN FOOD CANS SENT TO EAST GERMANY, BY DROPS ALONG THE

AUTOBAHN, AND BY FREQUENT TRIPS ON U.S . AIR FORCE COURIER FLIGHTS TO

BERLIN, WHICH THEY BOARDED UNDER THE PRETEXT OF BEING ON GEHLEN

BUSINESS, THE THREE GOT A TOTAL OF $78,000 FROM MOSCOW . FOR THE

INVESTMENT,

THE SOVIETS GOT 15,000 MICROFILM PHOTOGRAPHS OF WEST GERMAN

INTELLIGENCE DOCUMENTS, 20 SPOOLS OF TAPE RECORDINGS, NUMEROUS VERBAL

AND RADIO REPORTS, INCLUDING THE IDENTITY OF MANY WEST GERMAN AGENTS

WORKING BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN . AS THE TESTIMONY POURED FORTH, THE

OUTCRY FROM WEST GERMANY'S PRESS AND PUBLIC FORCED DEFENSE MINISTER

KAIUWE VON HASSEL TO PROMISE A " RE-EXAMINATION " OF GEHLEN'S

ORGANIZATION, AND REPORTEDLY GEHLEN WILL RETIRE SOON . VON HASSEL ADDED

LAMELY : " THERE WILL ALWAYS BE CASES OF INFILTRATION IN ANY

INTELLIGENCE SERVICE . " BUT THE GEHLEN GROUP MUST HAVE SET A RECORD OF

SORTS . AT ONE POINT, TESTIFIED FELFE, HIS RUSSIAN BOSSES URGED HIM TO

GET A TRANSFER BECAUSE THERE ALREADY WAS A SURPLUS OF SOVIET AGENTS IN

HIS DEPARTMENT . SHORTLY BEFORE THEIR ARREST, ADDED FELFE, HE AND

CLEMENS RECEIVED LETTERS OF COMMENDATION AND CASH BONUSES FROM THE

CHAIRMAN OF THE SOVIET COMMITTEE FOR STATE SECURITY.SIMULTANEOUSLY, THE

TWO AGENTS GOT CITATIONS FOR TEN YEARS' MERITORIOUS SERVICE FROM

GENERAL GEHLEN .

JET TEST PILOT STATIONED IN NORTHEAST POLAND, MAJOR OBACZ RECEIVED

OFFICIAL CLEARANCE TO LOG EXTRA FLIGHT TIME BY FLYING HIS FAMILY TO

VISIT RELATIVES IN SZCZECIN (FORMERLY STETTIN), ON THE EAST GERMAN

BORDER . OBACZ CRAMMED HIS WIFE AND TWO SONS, LESTER, 9, AND

CHRISTOPHER, 5, INTO THE REAR SEAT OF A PROPDRIVEN, TWO-SEATER TRAINING

PLANE . ONLY AFTER THEY WERE ALOFT DID HE TELL THEM OVER THE PLANE'S

INTERCOM THAT HE WAS MAKING A BREAK . TO AVOID COMMUNIST RADAR

DETECTION, HE HEDGEHOPPED OVER THE GROUND, NEVER FLEW HIGHER THAN 150

FT . THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE 150-MILE TRIP . WHEN ONE POLISH GROUND

STATION CALLED FOR HIS LOCATION, OBACZ DID NOT REPLY . AN HOUR AFTER

TAKE-OFF, OBACZ ROARED OVER WEST BERLIN'S CHECKPOINT CHARLIE AT ROOFTOP

LEVEL, LANDED AT TEMPELHOF AIRPORT, AND REQUESTED POLITICAL ASYLUM . "

I FLED BECAUSE I WAS FED UP, " OBACZ SAID . " I WAS TIRED OF PRESSURE .

I WANTED TO WORK TOWARD TRUTH . WE WANT THE RIGHT TO TRAVEL WHERE WE

WANT, THE RIGHT OF FREE SPEECH, THE RIGHT TO WORK FOR A GOOD CAUSE . "

WEST GERMANY THE ADIPOSE SOCIETY SINCE THE DAYS WHEN HITLER OPTED

FOR GUNS RATHER THAN BUTTER, WEST GERMANY HAS KNOWN NEAR-STARVATION,

AUSTERITY AND, FOR THE PAST DECADE, SUCH HEADY ABUNDANCE THAT TODAY IT

HAS BECOME THE ADIPOSE SOCIETY . FOLLOWING THE EARLY '50S, WHEN THE

POSTWAR BOOM SET OFF WHAT GERMANS CALL THE EDELFRESSWELLE, THE GORGEOUS

GOBBLING WAVE, BUTTOCKS AND BOSOMS HAVE EXPANDED EVEN MORE RAPIDLY THAN

THE ECONOMY, AND DOCTORS HAVE RECOGNIZED TWO UNIVERSAL AILMENTS :

DOPPELKINNEPIDEMIE, DOUBLE-CHIN EPIDEMIC, AND HANGEBAUCH, OR BELLYHANG

. THE MAJORITY OF GERMANS, FROM NEWBORN BABES TO CABINET MINISTERS, ARE

FATTER TODAY THAN AT ANY OTHER TIME IN THIS CENTURY . A TOP DIETETIC

AUTHORITY ESTIMATES THAT 20 PER CENT OF ALL WEST GERMANS ARE OVERWEIGHT

. IN A NEW BOOK TITLED GROW THIN, BUT HOW ? , DR . ANDREAS DUTTLER

WARNS : " CORPULENCE IS THE DARK SIDE OF THE ECONOMIC MIRACLE . "

REARGUARD ACTION . THE EXPLOSION OF VITAL STATISTICS IS AMPLY EVIDENT

FROM THE ISLAND OF SYLT, WHERE PNEUMATIC NUDISTS JOUNCE ACROSS THE

BEACHES, TO THE SPANISH COASTLINE, WHERE BULGY BRUNNHILDES HAVE ALREADY

MADE THE AUTHORITIES REGRET THEIR DECISION NOT TO ENFORCE A LONGTIME

BAN ON BIKINIS . WEST GERMANY'S MEN'S WEAR INDUSTRY IN RECENT YEARS HAS

HAD TO ADD A NEW CLOTHING CLASSIFICATION, TACTFULLY DUBBED BOSS OR

MANAGER SIZE ; NEARLY A QUARTER OF ALL NEW CLOTHES ARE NOW BOUGHT BY

CUSTOMERS OF MANAGERIAL GIRTH, WHILE SALES OF " NORMAL " SIZES ARE

DIMINISHING . FRENCH GARMENT MANUFACTURERS WHO EXPORT TO GERMANY SELL A

HIGHER PROPORTION OF JUMBO SIZES (16 TO 18) THERE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE .

IN MOST OTHER COUNTRIES, ALSO, WELL-BUTTRESSED WOMEN STEER CLEAR OF

SUCH REVEALING CLOTHES AS STRETCH SKI PANTS ; IN WEST GERMANY,

ACCORDING TO THE WORLD-GIRDLING BOGNER STRETCHPANTS CONCERN, THERE IS A

STEADY DEMAND FOR SLIPCOVER SIZES . MANY GERMAN WOMEN ARE FIGHTING A

DETERMINED REARGUARD ACTION, NONETHELESS . SALES OF FOUNDATION GARMENTS

HAVE QUADRUPLED SINCE 1950, AND SLIMMING PARLORS HAVE BECOME ALMOST AS

THICK AS GERMANY'S BELOVED WHIPPED CREAM . IN BONN, WHERE A SESSION AT

THE STYLISH SALON DER FIGUR RANGES FROM $6 FOR A PLUMP PUBESCENT TO

$125 FOR A WELLMARBLED DOWAGER, OWNER HELGA PIETSCH SIGHS : " NINETY

PERCENT OF THE GERMAN WOMEN WHO COME IN HERE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT A

CALORIE IS . " UNCONSCIOUS EATING . WEST GERMANY'S GOVERNMENT IS DOING

ITS LEVEL BEST TO TEACH THEM, FOR THE INCIDENCE OF ARTERIOSCLEROSIS AND

OTHER FAT-LINKED AILMENTS IS INCREASING RELENTLESSLY . THE SOCIETY FOR

NOURISHMENT SENDS 50 LADY DIETICIANS AROUND THE COUNTRY GIVING

WEIGHT-REDUCING LECTURES, AND HAS LAUNCHED A COUNTER-PAUNCHING

OFFENSIVE AIMED AT LEAVENING FACTORY MEALS . THE AVERAGE WEST GERMAN

CALORIE INTAKE IS ACTUALLY BELOW U.S . AND BRITISH LEVELS, BUT SUCH

STATISTICS DO NOT ACCOUNT FOR BEER, WHICH POURS DOWN TEUTONIC THROATS

AT THE ANNUAL RATE OF 432 GLASSES (100 CALORIES PER GLASS) FOR EACH

MAN, WOMAN AND CHILD . BESIDES, THE AVERAGE GERMAN CONSUMES MORE

STARCHES AND OTHER LIPOGENIC SUBSTANCES : 260 LBS . OF POTATOES, 155

LBS . OF BREAD AND 47 CHOCOLATE BARS EACH YEAR . GERMAN PALATES ARE NOT

EASILY WEANED AWAY FROM SUCH BELT-STRAINING DELICACIES AS ROAST GOOSE

(500 CALORIES FOR A GOOD-SIZED HELPING) OR KARTOFFELKLOSSE (MORE THAN

100 EACH), THEIR FAMED POTATO DUMPLINGS . THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, WOMEN

HOLD THEIR MIDMORNING KAFFEEKLATSCH AT PASTRY SHOPS THAT ARE AS RICH IN

CALORIFIC TEMPTATION AS THE WITCH'S COTTAGE IN HANSEL AND GRETEL . TV

HAS ALSO HELPED BRING THE COUNTRY TO POLYSATURATION POINT BY

ENCOURAGING WHAT DOCTORS CALL " UNCONSCIOUS EATING . " TO GET THROUGH A

POKER HAND WITH MAVERICK, GERMANS CONSUME VAST QUANTITIES OF PRETZELS

AND PASTRIES, AND FILL THE GAPS BETWEEN SNACKS WITH

ERFRISCHUNGSBONBONS, REFRESHMENT CANDIES . AND THEY ARE INCREASINGLY

RELUCTANT TO TAKE EXERCISE . ASKS A GARMENT INDUSTRY OFFICIAL : " WHO

WALKS NOWADAYS ANY MORE ? " TOP POTS . IF THE AUTOMOBILE IS A STATUS

SYMBOL IN GERMANY, SO IS THE PAUNCH . LIKE JULIUS CAESAR ( " LET ME

HAVE MEN ABOUT ME THAT ARE FAT " ), GERMAN VOTERS CONSIDER THAT SHEER

HEFT MAKES A POLITICIAN MORE KREDITWURDIG, OR TRUSTWORTHY . WHILE

KONRAD ADENAUER HAS REMAINED REASONABLY TRIM, MANY OTHER POLITICIANS

HAVE VISIBLY GONE TO POT . BUNDESTAG LEADER HEINRICH VON BRENTANO WAS A

SKINNY 150-POUNDER WHEN HE WAS FIRST ELECTED IN 1949, NOW WEIGHS AROUND

210 . FORMER WAR MINISTER FRANZ JOSEF STRAUSS WEIGHS ABOUT 270 LBS .

MANY TOP OFFICERS, NOTABLY BUNDESWEHR INSPECTOR GENERAL FRIEDRICH

FOERTSCH, ALSO SPORT UNMARTIAL POTBELLIES . UNDISPUTED CHAMPION IS

ADENAUER'S CHOSEN SUCCESSOR, STOCKY (5 FT . 10 IN . ECONOMICS MINISTER

LUDWIG ERHARD, WHO WEIGHS ABOUT 220 LBS., BUT HAS SOARED FAR HIGHER ON

OCCASION . WHENEVER A CRISIS THREATENS, SUCH AS THE METALWORKERS'

STRIKE LAST MAY, GERMANS CRY : " LET THE FAT MAN HANDLE IT . " AFTER

SETTLING THE STRIKE, ERHARD DREW ROAR OF APPROVAL WITH THE MODEST BRAG

: " I THREW MY WHOLE WEIGHT INTO IT . " SOME OBSERVERS CONSIDER

WAISTLINE INFLATION TO BE MERELY " A CULTURAL LAG " THAT WILL BE

CORRECTED AS GERMANS ACCEPT THE IDEA THAT GOOD TIMES ARE THERE TO STAY

. OTHERS, INCLUDING SOCIOLOGIST RENE KONIG, CONTEND THAT GERMAN

CORPULENCE IS A SYMPTOM OF SUBCONSCIOUS ANXIETY AND GUILT . IF ONLY FOR

THAT REASON, THERE SEEMS LITTLE LIKELIHOOD THAT GERMANS WILL EVER AGAIN

WANT LEAN AND HUNGRY LEADERS . " A THIN ERHARD ? " ASKS KONIG . "

NEVER . WHY, PEOPLE WOULDN'T BELIEVE IN WEST GERMANY'S PROSPERITY . "

GREAT BRITAIN A FOOLISH DISPLAY FOR THREE DAYS

LONDON'S GENTEEL WEST END LOOKED LIKE A BATTLEFIELD . NEAR BUCKINGHAM

PALACE, SQUADS OF POLICE GRAPPLED WITH LEATHER-JACKETED TOUGHS, WHILE

CHAUFFEURED BENTLEYS DELICATELY INCHED THEIR WAY THROUGH . WILD-EYED

GIRLS WITH STRAGGLY BLACK HAIR AND BLUEJEANED BOYS WITH GOLDEN TRESSES

WERE FROG-WALKED INTO PADDY WAGONS . SOME 200 PEOPLE WERE JAILED .

TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE CHAOS, A SIX-MAN GANG WAYLAID THE DOWAGER

DUCHESS OF NORTHUMBERLAND, SPED OFF IN A WHITE JAGUAR WITH HER JEWELS,

WORTH $200,000 . MOST SHOCKING OF ALL, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER

ELEVEN-YEAR REIGN, QUEEN ELIZABETH II WAS BOOED BY HER OWN PEOPLE .

CAUSE OF THE TROUBLE WAS THE LONGEXPECTED, LONG-DISPUTED STATE VISIT TO

BRITAIN BY GREECE'S KING PAUL AND QUEEN FREDERIKA . FEARING PRECISELY

THE KIND OF LEFT-WING DEMONSTRATIONS THAT OCCURRED LAST WEEK, GREEK

PREMIER CONSTANTINE KARAMANLIS ADVISED AGAINST THE TRIP, RESIGNED WHEN

THE ROYAL COUPLE REFUSED TO BOW TO PRESSURE AND DECIDED TO GO ANYWAY .

BRITISH POLITICAL CRITICS BASE THEIR CASE AGAINST THE KING AND QUEEN

LARGELY ON THE FACT THAT GREEK JAILS STILL CONTAIN ABOUT 1,000

PRISONERS SEIZED MORE THAN A DECADE AGO DURING THE CIVIL WAR ; MOST

ARE BELIEVED TO BE COMMUNIST, AND THE GREEKS POINT OUT THAT THEY ARE

BEING GRADUALLY RELEASED ANYWAY (THE ORIGINAL NUMBER OF PRISONERS WAS

4,000) . THE QUEEN IS ALSO ACCUSED OF NAZI SYMPATHIES, AN OLD AND

ABSURDLY EXAGGERATED CHARGE, AND OF MEDDLING TOO MUCH IN GREEK

POLITICS, HARDLY A BRITISH CONCERN . THE ANTIGREEK CHORUS IS MADE UP OF

A MOTLEY COLLECTION OF COMMUNISTS, SOCIALISTS, ANTI-MONARCHISTS, VAGUE

CRUSADERS IN SEARCH OF NEW CAUSES, BAN-THE-BOMBERS (INCLUDING THAT

FOOLISH SAGE, BERTRAND RUSSELL), ALL OF THEM JOINED IN THE LONDON

STREETS BY JOY-RIDING BEATNIKS . AMAZINGLY, THEY WERE ALSO JOINED, IN

SPIRIT, BY LABOR PARTY LEADER HAROLD WILSON AND DEPUTY LEADER GEORGE

BROWN, WHO CHOSE TO BOYCOTT A BANQUET FOR THE VISITORS WHICH COULD ONLY

RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH AND STABILITY OF BRITISH

POLITICS . BORN

PRINCESS OF HANOVER, FREDERIKA IS A GRANDDAUGHTER OF KAISER WILHELM II

(AND A GREAT-GREAT-GRANDDAUGHTER OF BRITAIN'S QUEEN VICTORIA, WHICH

ALSO MAKES HER A BRITISH PRINCESS AND A THIRD COUSIN OF QUEEN

ELIZABETH) . WHEN FREDERIKA WAS A YEAR OLD, HER FAMILY MOVED FROM

GERMANY TO AUSTRIA . AS A GIRL, SHE SUPPOSEDLY BELONGED TO A HITLERITE

YOUTH GROUP . IN SCHOOL IN ITALY DURING HER LATE TEENS, AT A TIME WHEN

THREE OF HER BROTHERS SERVED IN THE WEHRMACHT, SHE WAS HEARD TO DEFEND

NAZI GERMANY . THAT IS ABOUT THE ONLY FACT CRITICS CAN CITE TO SUPPORT

THEIR CASE . AFTER MARRYING PAUL IN 1938, FREDERIKA FLED GREECE UNDER

NAZI BOMBARDMENT, LIVED IN EXILE IN EGYPT AND SOUTH AFRICA TILL WAR'S

END .

AGENTS IN OVERALLS . FOR THE ROYAL

VISIT, THE MACMILLAN GOVERNMENT MOUNTED A SECURITY FORCE THAT OUTDID

EVEN THE BULGANIN-KHRUSHCHEV WELCOME IN 1956 . ON HAND WERE 5,000

POLICE, INCLUDING PLAINCLOTHESMEN DISGUISED IN EVERYTHING FROM MORNING

COATS TO OVERALLS . AS THE ROYAL PROCESSION OF CARRIAGES CLIPCLOPPED

FROM VICTORIA STATION, WHERE ELIZABETH GREETED THEM, TO BUCKINGHAM

PALACE, A WOMAN BURST FROM THE CROWD AND SHRIEKED : " RELEASE MY

HUSBAND ! " SHE TURNED OUT TO BE MRS . BETTY AMBATIELOS, 45, THE

ENGLISH WIFE OF ANTONIOS AMBATIELOS, A GREEK COMMUNIST SERVING A LIFE

TERM FOR HIS PART IN THE CIVIL WAR . THAT NIGHT, WHILE THE ROYAL

COUPLES AND 156 OTHER GUESTS DINED IN BUCKINGHAM PALACE, 2,000

DEMONSTRATORS POURED INTO TRAFALGAR SQUARE WITH BANNERS PROCLAIMING "

DOWN WITH THE NAZI QUEEN . " THE CROWD SEEMED BENT ON STORMING THE

PALACE BUT ENCOUNTERED MASSED LINES OF BOBBIES BLOCKING THE WAY .

POLICE HELMETS CLATTERED ACROSS SIDEWALKS, FISTS FLEW, TRAFFIC STALLED,

AND PRANCING POLICE HORSES BOWLED OVER CROWDS . RIOTERS FOUGHT OFF COPS

FROM ATOP A DOUBLEDECK BUS . A FEW YOUTHS WHO MADE IT TO THE MALL WERE

STOPPED BY FLYING TACKLES . " SEIG HEIL ! " FOR THE NEXT NIGHT, SO

THAT THE ROYAL PARTY COULD SEE SHAKESPEARE'S A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM

IN NEAR-PERFECT SECURITY, THE FOREIGN OFFICE HAD BOUGHT UP ALL 1,100

TICKETS TO THE ALDWYCH THEATER, DISTRIBUTED THEM TO A SELECT AUDIENCE

THAT INCLUDED LEADERS OF LONDON'S GREEK COMMUNITY . SHORTLY BEFORE

CURTAIN TIME, A FALSE REPORT THAT A BOMB HAD BEEN PLANTED IN THE

THEATER LED TO THE ADDITIONAL SPECTACLE OF POLICE IN EVENING CLOTHES

COMBING THE ROYAL BOX WITH A MINE DETECTOR . HELD BACK BY SIX ROWS OF

POLICE, 1,500 PEOPLE OUTSIDE GREETED THE ROYAL ARRIVALS WITH AN UGLY

DIN OF BOOS, HISSES AND MOCKING SHOUTS OF " SIEG HEIL ! " AND "

FASCIST SWINE . " THOUSANDS OF OTHERS CHEERED . AFTER THE PLAY, QUEEN

ELIZABETH LEFT THE THEATER ALONE, AND WAS GREETED BY ANOTHER CHORUS OF

BOOS . SHE LOOKED STARTLED AND DISMAYED . IT WAS PROBABLY THE FIRST

TIME THAT BRITISH ROYALTY HAD BEEN SO PUBLICLY HUMILIATED AT HOME SINCE

EDWARD VII WAS HISSED AT EPSOM IN THE LAST CENTURY AFTER RUMOR INVOLVED

HIM AS A CORRESPONDENT IN A DIVORCE CASE . WORSE THAN WOOLLY . NEXT

DAY, GREEK PREMIER PANAYOTIS PIPINELIS, WHO ACCOMPANIED THE KING AND

QUEEN, GRANTED MRS . AMBATIELOS A 45-MINUTE HEARING, WHEREUPON SHE

CALMED DOWN . BACK IN GREECE, 19 OF THE PRISONERS (NOT INCLUDING

AMBATIELOS) WERE FREED . AT WEEK'S END THE ROYAL COUPLE QUIETLY

RETURNED TO GREECE . SAID FREDERIKA BEFORE SHE LEFT : " THE DECISION

TO COME TO BRITAIN FOR A STATE VISIT WAS THE RIGHT ONE, ABSOLUTELY

RIGHT . I AM NOT WORRIED ABOUT THOSE FEW PEOPLE WHO DEMONSTRATED . THE

MEMORY I HAVE IS OF THE WARM RECEPTION WE WERE GIVEN ON OUR ARRIVAL . "

IN BRITAIN THE FOOLISH DISPLAY OF THE ANTI-GREEK DEMONSTRATORS LEFT

UNPLEASANT ECHOES . THOSE BEHIND THE RIOTS, WROTE THE DAILY MIRROR, "

ARE NOT MERELY LEADING WOOLLY-MINDED UNDERGRADUATES IN WOOLLY-MINDED

PEACE PROTESTS ; THEY ARE PROVIDING A SHIELD FOR MISCHIEVOUS COMMUNIST

AGITATION . " THE PAPER NOTED THAT " GREECE IS ABOUT THE ONLY COUNTRY

IN EASTERN EUROPE FREE FROM DICTATORSHIP, " THEN POSED A QUESTION THAT

SELF-ADVERTISED IDEALISTS HAVE YET TO ANSWER : WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME

THEY DEMONSTRATED IN BEHALF OF THE POLITICAL PRISONERS OF LITHUANIA OR

ESTONIA OR LATVIA OR POLAND OR HUNGARY OR RUMANIA OR BULGARIA OR EAST

GERMANY OR CZECHOSLOVAKIA ?

MALAYSIA THE QUADS QUINTUPLETS WERE EXPECTED, QUADRUPLETS

APPEARED . THAT WAS THE STORY IN LONDON LAST WEEK WHEN GOVERNMENT AND

COLONIAL LEADERS SIGNED THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE OF A NEW BRITISH

COMMONWEALTH NATION . IT WAS THE FEDERATION OF MALAYSIA, WHICH WAS TO

BE COMPOSED OF INDEPENDENT MALAYA, SELF-GOVERNING SINGAPORE, AND THE

THREE BRITISH TERRITORIES OF SARAWAK, BRUNEI AND NORTH BORNEO . BUT AT

THE LAST MOMENT, THE OIL-SODDEN SULTANATE OF BRUNEI PULLED OUT OF THE

AGREEMENT IN A FIT OF PIQUE OVER THE FINAL TERMS OF FEDERATION . MACY'S

V . GIMBELS . BRUNEI'S SUDDEN DEFECTION CAME AFTER WEEKS OF

CLIFFHANGING NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN MALAYA'S SHREWD PRIME MINISTER TUNKU

(PRINCE) ABDUL RAHMAN, FATHER OF THE FEDERATION SCHEME, AND SINGAPORE'S

BRILLIANT, MERCURIAL PRIME MINISTER LEE KUAN YEW . THOUGH THE TUNKU HAD

DEMANDED THAT SINGAPORE KICK IN 55 PER CENT OF ITS REVENUES TO THE

FEDERAL TREASURY, LEE MANAGED TO WHITTLE THE FIGURE DOWN TO 40 PER CENT

. BUT OVERPLAYING HIS HAND, HE THEN HELD OUT FOR 39 PER CENT . SO

INFURIATED WAS THE TUNKU AT THIS MACY'S V . GIMBELS TACTIC THAT HE

DELIVERED AN ULTIMATUM TO SINGAPORE TO GET IN THE FEDERATION OR STAY

OUT AND REFUSED TO GO TO LONDON FOR THE FINAL BARGAINING SESSIONS . IN

LONDON LEE DEMANDED THAT THE BRITISH COMPENSATE SINGAPORE FOR CONTINUED

USE OF THE ISLAND'S NAVAL AND MILITARY FACILITIES . BRITAIN CAME

THROUGH WITH AN OFFSHORE ISLAND AND AN OFFICERS' CLUB GOLF COURSE,

WHICH LEE PROMISED TO TURN INTO A BOTANICAL GARDEN . BUT WHEN THE

NEGOTIATIONS TURNED TO SUCH BASIC MATTERS AS SINGAPORE'S CONTINUED

STATUS AS A FREE PORT AND ITS FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE

UNDERDEVELOPED BORNEO TERRITORIES, THE DISCUSSIONS BOGGED DOWN . AS THE

IMPASSE CONTINUED, COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY DUNCAN SANDYS TOOK OVER AS

ARBITRATOR . SANDYS' " ABSOLUTE DEDICATION AND ZEAL, " SAID LEE, "

EQUALED THAT OF ANY DEDICATED COMMUNIST I'VE EVER HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO

MEET . " GOADING, GUIDING, PERSUADING, CAJOLING, SANDYS KEPT THE

NEGOTIATORS UP TO THE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING FOR FOUR CONSECUTIVE

LONDON, SAT IN HIS HOTEL SUITE WAITING FOR THE SIGNING CEREMONY . WHEN

A LAST OBSTACLE APPEARED, SANDYS PERSUADED LEE TO IRON IT OUT PRIVATELY

WITH THE TUNKU . THE FINAL AGREEMENT COMPROMISED ON FINANCIAL ISSUES .

SINGAPORE WILL LOAN MONEY TO THE BORNEO TERRITORIES RATHER THAN GIVE IT

OUTRIGHT, AND A FEDERATION COMMON MARKET WILL GRADUALLY REPLACE

SINGAPORE'S FREE-PORT STATUS . BRUNEI'S WITHDRAWAL ONLY SLIGHTLY

MAINLY SULKING OVER ABDUL RAHMAN'S APATHY TOWARD HIS AMBITION TO PLAY A

BIG CEREMONIAL ROLE IN THE NEW MALAYSIA . BUT BOTH THE SULTAN AND THE

SOUTH VIET NAM SUICIDE IN MANY FORMS A SOUTH VIETNAMESE NOVELIST

AND POLITICIAN NAMED NGUYEN TUONG TAM SENT HIS SONS OUT TO BUY A BOTTLE

OF WHISKY ONE NIGHT LAST WEEK . FOR A WHILE HE SAT DRINKING WITH THEM

AT HIS HOME IN SAIGON . " MY SONS, I FEEL VERY HAPPY TONIGHT, " HE SAID

. " I AM GOING TO DIE VERY SOON . " SUDDENLY HE KEELED OVER, WAS RUSHED

TO A HOSPITAL WHERE HE DIED NEXT MORNING . IN HIS GLASS WAS FOUND A

LETHAL DOSE OF CYANIDE . NOVELIST TAM, 58, WAS A REVOLUTIONARY LEADER

IN INDO-CHINA'S WAR AGAINST THE FRENCH . BUT AFTER INDEPENDENCE IN

1954, HE GREW INCREASINGLY DISENCHANTED WITH THE AUTHORITARIAN RULE OF

SOUTH VIET NAM'S PRESIDENT NGO DINH DIEM . FORTNIGHT AGO, DIEM'S

GOVERNMENT CHARGED TAM AND 34 OTHERS WITH TREASON BY CONSPIRING TO

OVERTHROW THE PRESIDENT IN AN ABORTIVE COUP ATTEMPT IN NOVEMBER 1960 .

IT WAS JUST TWO DAYS BEFORE THE SCHEDULED TRIAL THAT TAM COMMITTED

SUICIDE, AND HE EXPLAINED WHY IN A NOTE HE LEFT BEHIND . " THE ARREST

AND TRIAL OF ALL NATIONALIST OPPONENTS OF THE REGIME IS A CRIME THAT

WILL FORCE THE NATION INTO THE HANDS OF THE COMMUNISTS, " HE WROTE . "

I OPPOSE THIS CRIME, AND I KILL MYSELF AS A WARNING TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO

ARE TRAMPLING ON OUR FREEDOMS . " DRAGGING FEET . DIEM'S GOVERNMENT

MOVED QUICKLY TO HEAD OFF DEMONSTRATIONS OVER TAM'S DEATH, POSTHUMOUSLY

ACQUITTED HIM OF ALL CONSPIRACY CHARGES AT THE SAIGON TREASON TRIAL .

AT THE SAME TIME, THE PROSECUTORS TRIED TO IMPLICATE THE U.S . AS BEING

BEHIND THE 1960 COUP ; THE CHARGE WAS VIGOROUSLY DENIED BY THE U.S .

AT THE END OF THE TRIAL, GOVERNMENT JUDGES SENTENCED 20 DEFENDANTS TO

PRISON TERMS RANGING FROM FIVE TO EIGHT YEARS ; NINE OTHERS WHO HAD

FLED THE COUNTRY AFTER THE ATTEMPTED COUP WERE SENTENCED TO DEATH IN

ABSENTIA . TAM'S SUICIDE AND THE SAIGON TRIAL SERVED ONCE AGAIN TO

STOKE SOUTH VIET NAM'S SMOLDERING RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL CRISIS . LAST

MONTH BUDDHIST MONK THICH QUANG DUC BURNED HIMSELF TO DEATH ON A SAIGON

STREET CORNER IN PROTEST AGAINST RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED ON THE COUNTRY'S

12 MILLION BUDDHISTS BY DIEM'S PREDOMINANTLY ROMAN CATHOLIC REGIME .

AFTER A SERIES OF NATIONWIDE DEMONSTRATIONS, THE GOVERNMENT, UNDER U.S

. PRODDING, YIELDED TO BUDDHIST DEMANDS AND GRANTED THEM EQUAL

RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL STANDING WITH THE NATION'S 1,500,000 CATHOLICS

. BUT INFLUENCED BY HIS BROTHER, NGO DINH NHU, WHO BELIEVES THAT THE

BUDDHISTS ARE RED DUPES, THE MILITANTLY CATHOLIC DIEM HAS DRAGGED HIS

FEET IN IMPLEMENTING THESE CONCESSIONS . MANY VIETNAMESE BUDDHISTS,

SAYS NHU, " HAVE BECOME FANATIC, LOST THEIR COMMON SENSE, AND ARE READY

TO FOLLOW ANYONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO EXPLOIT THEM UNDER THE BANNER OF

RELIGION . " THIS WAS THE KIND OF DOGGED ANTI-BUDDHIST ATTITUDE THAT

HAS DANGEROUSLY UNDERCUT GOVERNMENT SUPPORT . ALREADY ONE GENERAL HAS

RESIGNED HIS FIELD COMMAND IN PROTEST OVER GOVERNMENT BUNGLING OF THE

BUDDHIST ISSUE . SIMPLE REASON . DIEM'S

INTRANSIGENCE HAS DISMAYED U.S . OFFICIALS, WHO FEAR THAT MOUNTING

BUDDHIST DISCONTENT CAN ONLY HINDER THE WAR EFFORT AGAINST THE VIET

CONG, JUST WHEN IT IS BEGINNING TO GO WELL . OVER THE PAST YEAR,

GOVERNMENT FORCES AND THEIR 14,000 U.S . MILITARY " ADVISERS " HAVE

VASTLY INCREASED THEIR MOBILITY AND STRIKING POWER AGAINST THE RED

GUERRILLAS . MORE THAN 7,000 " STRATEGIC HAMLETS " HAVE BEEN BUILT, NOW

PROTECT 8,000,000 VIETNAMESE FROM VIET CONG RAIDS . DESPITE ALL

MISGIVINGS, THE U.S . STILL STANDS BEHIND DIEM FOR A SIMPLE REASON THAT

HE HIMSELF SPELLED OUT IN A BLUNT WARNING LAST WEEK : " FOR A MOMENT,

IMAGINE THAT ANOTHER GOVERNMENT REPLACES THIS ONE : IT COULD NOT HELP

RESULTING IN CIVIL WAR AND DREADFUL DICTATORSHIP . " WASHINGTON HAS

CONSIDERED ALTERNATIVES TO DIEM, BUT FEARS THAT THE CONFUSION OF A COUP

COULD ONLY BENEFIT THE VIET CONG AND MIGHT END UP WITH A REGIME NO

BETTER THAN THE PRESENT ONE . THUS U.S . AMBASSADOR FREDERICK NOLTING,

WHO IS SOON TO BE REPLACED BY HENRY CABOT LODGE, RETURNED TO SAIGON

FROM WASHINGTON CONSULTATIONS LAST WEEK WITH A PERSONAL MESSAGE OF

CONFIDENCE FOR DIEM FROM JOHN KENNEDY . BUT NOLTING ALSO LIGHTLY RAPPED

DIEM ON THE KNUCKLES FOR LETTING THE BUDDHIST CRISIS CONTINUE . " THE

U.S . STANDS FOR AND SUPPORTS FREEDOM OF RELIGION FOR ALL PEOPLE, " HE

SAID . " IT WOULD BE A TRAGEDY IF THE GAINS AGAINST THE VIET CONG WERE

WIPED OUT BY DISSENSIONS AMONG VIETNAMESE CITIZENS, WHO DESIRE ABOVE

ALL FREEDOM OF CHOICE FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THEIR COUNTRY .

. EVEN WORSE IS THE PLIGHT OF SOME 5,800 NONWHITES JAILED IN RECENT

MONTHS AS PART OF THE GOVERNMENT'S ANTISABOTAGE DRIVE, WHICH INCREASED

SOUTH AFRICA'S PRISON POPULATION TO A RECORD OF SOME 67,700 (OUT OF A

TOTAL POPULATION OF 15 MILLION) . BREAD & WATER . THIS GRIM ASPECT OF

CHAIRS FOR 24 HOURS OF COMPLETE SILENCE, EATING ONLY BREAD AND WATER .

FOR THE " HOT LINE " THAT IS TO LINK THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE KREMLIN IN

EMERGENCIES . AT THE FIRST MEETING, HARRIMAN, 71, WAS GREETED BY

KHRUSHCHEV WITH A CHEERY " YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY BLOOMING . WHAT ARE YOU

DOING, COUNTING YOUR YEARS BACKWARD ? " WHEN BRITAIN'S TOP ENVOY,

VISCOUNT HAILSHAM, SAID THAT MOSCOW'S WEATHER WAS BETTER THAN LONDON'S,

KHRUSHCHEV REPLIED : " WE COULD PERHAPS FIND SOME PLACE FOR YOU HERE .

YOU COULD BE AN INTERNEE . " FINALLY THE PRINCIPALS SAT DOWN AT THE

CONFERENCE TABLE, ACCOMPANIED BY THEIR TOP AIDES FOREIGN MINISTER

ANDREI GROMYKO, DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER VALERIAN ZORIN, AND CHIEF

DISARMAMENT NEGOTIATOR SEMYON TSARAPKIN ON THE RUSSIAN SIDE, U.S .

AMBASSADOR FOY KOHLER AND BRITISH AMBASSADOR SIR HUMPHREY TREVELYAN FOR

THE WEST . SAID KHRUSHCHEV : " WE BEGIN IMMEDIATELY WITH THE SIGNING .

/ ADDED GROMYKO : " THEN ALL THAT WILL REMAIN WILL BE TO FILL THE

TREATY IN . " DURING THE EARLY SESSIONS, IT ALMOST SEEMED THAT EASY .

KHRUSHCHEV SAID THAT, SINCE IT HAD BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH AGREEMENT

ON A FULL BAN IN THE PAST, THE TIME HAD COME TO ACHIEVE MORE BY

ATTEMPTING LESS . HE GAVE SOVIET APPROVAL TO A LIMITED BAN WHICH WOULD

COVER ALL TESTS EXCEPT THOSE UNDERGROUND, REPEATING HIS FAMILIAR

OPPOSITION TO ONSITE INSPECTIONS OF POSSIBLE UNDERGROUND BLASTS . AS

USUAL, GROMYKO ARGUED THAT SUCH INSPECTIONS WERE UNNECESSARY ANYWAY, IN

VIEW OF LONG-RANGE SEISMIC DETECTION DEVICES . WHEN THE SUDDEN CRASH OF

AN ACCIDENTALLY OVERTURNED CHAIR STARTLED THE DELEGATES, GROMYKO SAID

QUICKLY : " THIS IS CONFIRMATION THAT EVERYONE DETECTS IT . " GROWLED

HAILSHAM : " IT STILL NEEDS INSPECTION . /

SELLING MOOD .

ARGUING THAT UNDERGROUND

BLASTS CAN INDEED BE DETECTED FROM FAR OFF BUT NOT DIFFERENTIATED FROM

EARTHQUAKES, THE U.S . IS NEVERTHELESS WILLING TO DEFER THE QUESTION .

AS FOR KHRUSHCHEV, HE WAS IN A SELLING MOOD . DRAWING OUT OF THE HAT A

FIVE-YEAR-OLD SOVIET PROPOSAL, HE CALLED FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF

INSPECTION POSTS AT AIRFIELDS, HIGHWAYS, RAILROAD STATIONS AND PORTS ON

BOTH SIDES OF THE IRON CURTAIN TO REDUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF SURPRISE

ATTACK . HE ALSO PROPOSED 1) FREEZING OR REDUCTION OF MILITARY BUDGETS,

2) A REDUCTION OF THE ARMED FORCES ON BOTH SIDES IN EAST AND WEST

GERMANY, AND 3) A NONAGGRESSION PACT BETWEEN THE NATO AND WARSAW PACT

POWERS . HE EVEN SEEMED WILLING TO ACCEPT THE U.S . IDEA OF PARALLEL

BUT SEPARATE DECLARATIONS INSTEAD OF A FORMAL PACT, WHICH WOULD AVOID

IMPLICIT U.S . RECOGNITION OF THE EAST GERMAN COMMUNIST REGIME . THE

SUDDEN ARRIVAL IN MOSCOW OF A HIGH-LEVEL EAST GERMAN DELEGATION THAT

INCLUDED WALTER ULBRICHT'S BERLIN SPECIALIST, IMMEDIATELY RAISED

SPECULATION THAT BERLIN WAS ON THE AGENDA . BUT ANY POSSIBLE DEAL

INVOLVING BERLIN OR THE BALANCE OF FORCES IN EUROPE WOULD REQUIRE U.S .

CONSULTATION WITH ITS ALLIES . WEST GERMANY WASTED LITTLE TIME IN

WARNING THE U.S . THAT ANY AGREEMENT OTHER THAN A TEST BAN WOULD NOT

ONLY USHER IN A PERIOD OF " FALSE SECURITY " IN EUROPE, BUT WOULD ALSO

MAKE IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT FOR THE U.S.'S EUROPEAN ALLIES TO HEED

WASHINGTON'S PLEAS FOR HIGHER NATO MILITARY EXPENDITURES OR TO RESPECT

THE EMBARGO OF " STRATEGIC MATERIALS " TO THE EAST . NO OBSTACLES .

WHY, AFTER YEARS OF STALLING, IS KHRUSHCHEV PUSHING A TEST BAN TREATY

AND A DETENTE WITH THE WEST ? WESTERN DIPLOMATS POINT TO THE

SINO-SOVIET SPLIT AS THE MAIN REASON (SEE FOLLOWING STORY) ENGAGED IN

AN ALL-OUT POWER STRUGGLE WITH THE CHINESE, KHRUSHCHEV PRESUMABLY WANTS

A TEST BAN TREATY TO DEMONSTRATE TO COMMUNISTS ALL OVER THE WORLD THE

FEASIBILITY OF " PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE . " NOR WOULD KHRUSHCHEV MIND

CUTTING DOWN A LITTLE ON THE PROHIBITIVE COST OF NUCLEAR TESTING AND

PRODUCTION, WHICH IMPEDES HIS OFT-STATED DESIRE TO RAISE LIVING

STANDARDS IN THE SOVIET UNION . LASTLY, WHILE A TEST BAN WOULD NOT BE

BINDING ON EITHER FRANCE OR RED CHINA, IT WOULD PLACE THE ONUS OF

DEFYING THE AGREEMENT ON THEM . PRESIDENT KENNEDY SUGGESTED AT HIS

PRESS CONFERENCE LAST WEEK THAT IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCORD, THE THREE

NEGOTIATORS GO TO GENEVA AND GET THE SIGNATURES OF THE 17-NATION GENEVA

DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE . SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT WOULD BOX IN THE FRENCH

WITH SOMETHING MORE THAN AN " ANGLO-SAXON " -SOVIET AGREEMENT FROM THE

VIEWPOINT OF RUSSIA'S QUARREL WITH THE CHINESE, IT WOULD ALSO PUT SUCH

GENEVA " NEUTRALS " AS EGYPT, BURMA AND INDIA ON THE RECORD AS

SUPPORTING A SOVIET-SPONSORED AGREEMENT . AT WEEK'S END A TEST BAN

AGREEMENT SEEMED NEAR . BANTERING WITH HARRIMAN AT A RECEPTION,

KHRUSHCHEV SAID : " THE TALKS ARE GOING ON WELL . THERE HAVE BEEN NO

OBSTACLES . IF THEY GO ON AS THEY HAVE, AN AGREEMENT IS IN SIGHT . "

*TEXT 394 07/26/63 PAGE 023

COMMUNISTS " GET OUT OF HERE " AND SO THE

CHINESE WENT HOME . AT THE AIRPORT, WHEN A WESTERN CORRESPONDENT ASKED

TENG HSIAO-PING, THE CHIEF OF PEKING'S DEPARTING DELEGATION, HOW THE

TALKS HAD GONE, HE REPLIED, " VERY GOOD . " OBVIOUSLY, THE OPPOSITE WAS

TRUE . DURING THEIR LAST WEEK IN MOSCOW, WHILE WESTERN NEGOTIATIORS

WERE FETED AND FLATTERED, A KIND OF GREAT WALL SURROUNDED THE UNWELCOME

VISITORS FROM PEKING . FROM THEIR ISOLATED COMPOUND ON MOSCOW'S LENIN

HILLS, THE RED CHINESE DELEGATES VENTURED OUT ONLY IN CURTAINED BLACK

CHAIKA LIMOUSINES FOR THE SHORT DRIVE TO PEKING'S EMBASSY ; ON

ALTERNATE DAYS THEY MET WITH A SOVIET DELEGATION, OBVIOUSLY TO NO

EFFECT . KHRUSHCHEV POINTEDLY STAYED AWAY FROM THE MEETINGS, ALTHOUGH

HE WAS OTHERWISE ACTIVE IN THE DIPLOMATIC AND SOCIAL WHIRL . THE MOSCOW

FILM FESTIVAL PROVIDED AN EXCUSE FOR LOTS OF PARTIES, AT WHICH WESTERN

ENVOYS AND SOVIET FUNCTIONARIES MIXED AMIABLY WITH SUCH MOVIE STARS AS

SHELLY WINTERS, SUSAN STRASBERG, YVES MONTAND AND SIMONE SIGNORET . AT

WEEK'S END KHRUSHCHEV FINALLY TURNED TO HIS OTHER GUESTS AND, IN A

RELATIVELY GRACIOUS GESTURE, TOSSED THE RED CHINESE A FAREWELL DINNER .

ALTHOUGH DESCRIBED AS " FRIENDLY, " THE MEAL COULD HAVE PRODUCED LITTLE

BEYOND DYSPEPSIA, FOR KHRUSHCHEV HAD SPOILED THE TABLE TALK IN ADVANCE,

DELIVERING AN ORATORICAL BLAST AT PEKING THAT IN EFFECT DECLARED

POLITICAL WAR ON THE CHINESE . THE CHALLENGE . AT A MASSIVE RALLY OF

PARTY BUREAUCRATS AND PROPAGANDISTS IN THE KREMLIN'S PALACE OF THE

CONGRESSES, KHRUSHCHEV SPOKE WITH SUCH APOPLECTIC VEHEMENCE THAT AT ONE

POINT HE GROPED FOR WORDS AND RHETORICALLY BEGGED THE AUDIENCE : "

HELP ME OUT . " BUT HE DIDN'T NEED MUCH HELP . ANGRILY DEFENDING HIS

DESTALINIZATION DRIVE AGAINST PEKING'S ATTACKS, HE DEMANDED : " WHAT

DO THEY WANT ? TO FRIGHTEN OUR PEOPLE, TO BRING BACK THE DAYS WHEN A

MAN WENT TO HIS JOB AND DID NOT KNOW WHETHER HE WOULD SEE HIS WIFE AND

CHILDREN AGAIN ? " DROPPING HIS VOICE TO A DRAMATIC WHISPER,

KHRUSHCHEV SAID THAT LETTERS TO HIM FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY EXPRESSED

GRATITUDE FOR ENDING THE STALINIST TERROR . THEN HE ADDED :. " IF

STALIN HAD DIED TEN YEARS EARLIER, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN BETTER . "

THE SOVIET BOSS WAS EQUALLY CONTEMPTUOUS ON THE SUBJECT OF PEKING'S

WARMONGERING FOREIGN POLICY . " THEY SAY ONE SHOULD START A REVOLUTION,

A WAR, " HE SHOUTED, " AND ON THE CORPSES AND THE RUINS, A MORE

PROSPEROUS SOCIETY WILL BE CREATED . AND WHO WOULD REMAIN IN THIS

PROSPEROUS SOCIETY ? WOULDN'T THE LIVING ENVY THE DEAD ? " DIRECTLY

ACCUSING THE CHINESE OF TRYING TO UNSEAT HIM, KHRUSHCHEV DARED PEKING

TO TAKE ITS CASE TO THE SOVIET PEOPLE : " I DECLARE TO THOSE WHO WOULD

LIKE TO OVERTHROW US I CHALLENGE YOU, COMRADES LET'S PICK OUT ANY PLANT

OR COLLECTIVE FARM . YOU PRESENT YOUR PROGRAM AND WE WILL PRESENT OURS

. YOU WON'T NEED ARMOR OR A PILLOW FOR PROTECTION . OUR PEOPLE ARE

POLITE . THEY'LL LISTEN AND SAY : " GET OUT OF HERE . /

BOURGEOIS COMRADES . ALMOST AS VEHEMENT WAS

A 19,000-WORD OPEN LETTER FROM THE KREMLIN THAT CALLED THE CHINESE

LIARS, HYPOCRITES AND COWARDS . MOSCOW DISMISSED THE RED CHINESE CLAIM

TO PROLETARIAN PURITY AND ACCUSED THEM OF TRYING TO GOAD RUSSIA INTO

WAR WITH THE U.S . PRINTED IN PRAVDA, THE SOVIET COUNTERATTACK WAS

ADDRESSED TO COMMUNIST CADRES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND IT SERVED NOTICE

THAT MOSCOW WOULD PUSH ITS PLATFORM BEFORE ALL 81 " FRATERNAL " PARTIES

AT ALL COSTS . AS THE SOVIETS THEMSELVES ANGRILY POINTED OUT, PEKING

WAS ACTIVELY " ORGANIZING AND SUPPORTING BANDS OF RENEGADE " REDS IN

SEVEN NATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD THE SINO-SOVIET QUARREL HAS SHARPLY

DIVIDED LOCAL COMMUNIST PARTIES, SPLITTING RACE FROM RACE AND CONTINENT

FROM CONTINENT . IN EUROPE THE QUARREL IS NOISIEST AMONG THE ITALIAN

COMRADES . NOWHERE DOES THE COMMUNIST PARTY SEEM MORE BOURGEOIS ; FOR

JUST THAT REASON, NOWHERE IN EUROPE HAS PEKING FOUND MORE SUPPORTERS

FOR ITS CREDO OF ALL-OUT REVOLUTION . IN PADUA A GROUP OF COMMUNIST

PARTY MEMBERS, EXPELLED FOR FAVORING PEKING, PUBLISHED A PAMPHLET

DENOUNCING RED BUREAUCRATS WHO LIVED THE SWEET LIFE, COMPLETE WITH "

WIVES AND MISTRESSES IN JEWELS AND FURS . " SOME 30,000 ITALIAN REDS,

MANY OF THEM SONS OF PROMINENT COMMUNISTS, HAVE FORMED ABOUT 20

CHAPTERS OF THE CHINESE-ITALIAN FRIENDSHIP SOCIETY . THE REBELS ARE

BACKED BY FUNDS BELIEVED TO BE CHANNELED THROUGH THE ALBANIAN LEGATION

IN ROME ; THEY CIRCULATE PROPAGANDA MATERIAL PREPARED BY RED CHINESE

SPECIALISTS OPERATING FROM A FANCY VILLA IN BERN, SWITZERLAND . LAST

WEEK COMMUNIST PARTY VICE SECRETARY LUIGI LONGO RUSHED TO MILAN TO PUT

DOWN A REBELLION OF SINOPHILES, AND EXPLAINED THAT BY APPEARING

MODERATE, ITALIAN REDS HAVE PROSPERED AT THE POLLS . AS HE EMERGED FROM

THE MEETING, LONGO DISCOVERED THE SLOGANS " VIVA STALIN, " / VIVA MAO "

PAINTED ON NEARBY WALLS . AIRMAIL WAR . IN AFRICA AND ASIA THE SPLIT IS

INCREASINGLY RACIAL . THE SOVIETS ARE COMPLAINING THAT AT THE RECENT

ASIAN-AFRICAN SOLIDARITY CONFERENCE IN TANGANYIKA, A RED CHINESE

OFFICIAL TOLD THE MOSCOW DELEGATION : " THE WHITES HAVE NOTHING TO DO

HERE . " SUCH A BLATANT RACIST LINE, ARGUES MOSCOW, IS PURSUED IN THE

UNDERDEVELOPED AREAS AT RUSSIA'S EXPENSE ; IT " IMPLANTS THE SNEAKY

IDEA THAT THE PEOPLES OF SOME REGIONS ARE MORE REVOLUTIONARY THAN

OTHERS . " INDIA'S COMMUNIST MOVEMENT HAS BEEN DEEPLY DIVIDED, BUT LAST

WEEK FORMALLY LINED UP WITH KHRUSHCHEV, JUST AS AN INDIAN GOVERNMENT

PURCHASING COMMISSION ARRIVED IN MOSCOW SHOPPING FOR ARMS TO BE USED IN

DEFENSE AGAINST THE RED CHINESE . IN JAPAN, MOST OF WHOSE COMMUNISTS

FAVOR RED CHINA FOR ETHNIC REASONS, THE STRUGGLE HAS BECOME PRETTY

PETTY, RESULTING IN AN AIRMAIL CIRCULATION WAR . SOON AFTER PRAVDA

BEGAN TO ARRIVE IN TOKYO BY AIR, PEKING'S PEOPLE'S DAILY DROPPED ITS

SEAMAIL DELIVERY, WHICH USED TO TAKE A MONTH, AND ALSO TOOK TO THE AIR

AT NO INCREASE IN POSTAL RATES TO SUBSCRIBERS . THE NIGHTMARE . THOUGH

THE LEADERSHIP OF MOST LATIN AMERICAN COMMUNIST PARTIES IS FIRMLY

PRO-MOSCOW, THE RANK AND FILE LEAN TOWARD PEKING . REDS IN BRAZIL HAVE

SPLIT INTO THREE RIVAL SECTS . ONE OF URUGUAY'S TOP REDS WAS RECENTLY

EXPELLED FOR HIS RED CHINESE SYMPATHIES ; HOWEVER, THE PARTY NEWSPAPER

STILL ACCEPTS PAID ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM PEKING PROPAGANDISTS . AS FOR THE

BEARD, FIDEL'S REVOLUTIONARY SYMPATHIES LIE WITH MAO, BUT HE KNOWS

BETTER THAN TO BITE NIKITA'S HAND, AND LAST WEEK HE DUTIFULLY ENDORSED

THE MOSCOW LINE . STILL, RED CHINA HAS NOT GIVEN UP HOPE OF CONVERTING

CASTRO . CUBA IS ONE OF THE FEW PLACES IN THE WORLD WHERE BOTH CHINESE

AND RUSSIAN TECHNICIANS REMAIN AT WORK . THIS MONTH PEKING HAPPILY

PROCLAIMED THAT ITS EXPERTS HAVE HELPED THE CUBANS TO RAISE 25,000

PEKING DUCKS . THESE SINO-SOVIET DUELS AROUND THE WORLD, AS MUCH AS THE

FRUITLESS TALKS IN MOSCOW, HAVE SHATTERED ANY PROSPECT OF EARLY

RECONCILIATION . NOW THAT THE MOSCOW MEETING HAS COLLAPSED, BOTH SIDES

IN EFFECT CONCEDE THAT WHAT BEGAN AS A CHARADE OF UNITY HAS BECOME A

COMMUNIST NIGHTMARE .

SOUTH VIET NAM THE BUDDHIST CRISIS IN SAIGON'S HUGE XA

LOI PAGODA, BUDDHIST MONKS AND NUNS WERE HOLDING A 48-HOUR HUNGER

STRIKE AGAINST THE REGIME OF SOUTH VIET NAM'S PRESIDENT NGO DINH DIEM .

EXPECTING TROUBLE, POLICE SEALED OFF NEARBY STREETS WITH BARBED WIRE .

TO PREVENT A REPETITION OF THE RITUALISTIC SUICIDE LAST MONTH, WHEN A

PROTESTING BUDDHIST MONK BURNED HIMSELF TO DEATH ON A SAIGON STREET

CORNER, TWO FIRE TRUCKS WERE ON HAND . SUDDENLY, ABOUT 500

SAFFRON-ROBED BUDDHIST PRIESTS, LAYMEN AND WOMEN EMERGED FROM A NEARBY

ALLEY AND STARTED TO RUN TOWARD THE PAGODA TO JOIN THEIR FASTING

FELLOW-BUDDHISTS . STYMIED BY WIRE AND POLICE, THE DEMONSTRATORS SAT

DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET . RIOT SQUADS ARRIVED . ARMED WITH A

WALKIE-TALKIE RADIO, TWO SPORT-SHIRTED AMERICAN C.I.A . MEN DELIVERED A

RUNNING COMMENTARY ON EVENTS TO HEADQUARTERS . A MONK WITH A PORTABLE

LOUDSPEAKER REPEATED : " WE HAVE BEEN DECEIVED MANY TIMES AND WE NO

LONGER HAVE ANY FAITH IN THE REGIME . " GOVERNMENT SECRET POLICE IN

CIVILIAN CLOTHES YELLED BACK THAT THE BUDDHISTS WERE BEING EXPLOITED BY

THE COMMUNISTS . THEN THE POLICE CHARGED THE PEACEFUL SEATED CROWDS,

CAUSING ONE OF THE UGLIEST SCENES IN SOUTH VIET NAM'S THREE-MONTHS-OLD

BUDDHIST CRISIS . AT GUNPOINT . WITH RIFLE BUTTS, CLUBS AND TOMMY-GUN

CLIPS, THE COPS BATTERED THE DEMONSTRATORS . WOMEN WHO HAD FALLEN TO

THE PAVEMENT IN THE FIRST POLICE RUSH WERE SAVAGELY KICKED . A YOUNG

GIRL HAD HER HEAD SPLIT OPEN WITH A CARBINE BUTT, AND AS BLOOD STREAMED

INTO HER EYES, SHE WAS CARTED AWAY IN A POLICE VAN . FROM THE WINDOWS

OF A BROTHEL, GIRLS SHOUTED INSULTS AT THE POLICE UNTIL FORCED INSIDE

AT MACHINE-GUN POINT . THROUGHOUT SOUTH VIET NAM, GOVERNMENT FORCES

CRUSHED BUDDHIST DEMONSTRATIONS WITH SIMILAR VIOLENCE, ARRESTED NEARLY

300 MARCHERS IN SAIGON ALONE, FOLLOWING ORDERS TO " USE ANY MEANS " TO

DISPERSE BUDDHIST DEMONSTRATIONS . TOP U.S . EMBASSY PEOPLE IN SAIGON

WERE " SHOCKED AND DISGUSTED " BY THE DIEM GOVERNMENT'S ACTION . ONE

MONK DELIVERED A PROTEST NOTE TO THE EMBASSY, URGING THE U.S . TO FORCE

DIEM TO RELENT ; U.S . AMBASSADOR FREDERICK E . NOLTING TELEPHONED

VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS AND GOT ASSURANCES THAT THE MAN WOULD NOT BE

MOLESTED . BUT NO SOONER HAD THE MONK LEFT THAN SECRET POLICE AGENTS

TRIED TO SPIRIT HIM AWAY IN A WAITING TAXI . THE PRIEST FOUGHT THEM OFF

AND RACED BACK TOWARD THE U.S . EMBASSY . A U.S . OFFICIAL DRAGGED HIM

TO SAFETY THROUGH THE DOOR AS A HUSKY MARINE GUARD PEELED A VIETNAMESE

COP FROM THE PRIEST'S BACK . MORALITY CRUSADE . IRONICALLY, THE CRISIS

INVOLVES ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST DOCILE RELIGIONS . YET, IN A SENSE,

THAT VERY QUALITY MAKES BUDDHISM A PROBLEM . SINCE IT KNOWS NO SENSE OF

SIN, AND HENCE NO REPRISAL FOR ERROR, IT IS, AT LEAST BY WESTERN

STANDARDS, PASSIVE, BACKWARD AND NEUTRAL . BUDDHISM, SAYS THEOLOGIAN

PAUL TILLICH, " GIVES NO DECISIVE MOTIVES FOR SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION,

AND THUS PROVIDES A NONPOLITICAL OPPORTUNITY FOR AN INVASION OF

BUDDHIST EAST ASIA BY THE COMMUNIST QUASI-RELIGION WITH ITS HOPE FOR A

TRANSFORMED WORLD . " ALTHOUGH THE RED CHINESE ARE WOOING THE BUDDHISTS

EVERYWHERE, THERE IS NO REAL EVIDENCE SO FAR THAT THE REDS ARE USING

SOUTH VIET NAM'S BUDDHISTS, AS THE DIEM GOVERNMENT CHARGES . ON THE

OTHER HAND, DIEM HAS NOT SUCCEEDED IN USING THEM EITHER UNLIKE

THAILAND'S STRONGMAN SARIT THANARAT, WHO HAS SHOWN THAT,WHEN HANDLED

PROPERLY, THEY CAN BE A SOLID, ANTI-COMMUNIST FORCE .

UNTIL RECENTLY, THE BUDDHISTS

IN SOUTH VIET NAM HAD NO REAL CASE AGAINST DIEM . SINCE THE BUDDHISTS

WERE SOUTH VIET NAM'S DOMINANT GROUP FOR CENTURIES AND RESENT ROMAN

CATHOLICISM AS THE RELIGION OF THEIR FORMER FRENCH MASTERS DIEM HAS

TAKEN PAINS NOT TO SHOW OBVIOUS FAVORITISM TOWARD FELLOW CATHOLICS .

ONLY THREE OF 19 ARMY GENERALS AND FIVE OF 17 CABINET MINISTERS ARE

CATHOLICS . THOUGH NEARLY HALF OF THE 123-MEMBER NATIONAL ASSEMBLY IS

CATHOLIC, THIS IS LARGELY BECAUSE CATHOLIC SCHOOLS TURN OUT BETTER

EDUCATED GRADUATES THAN BUDDHIST SCHOOLS . MOST VIETNAMESE NEVERTHELESS

BELIEVE THAT DIEM'S CATHOLIC RULING FAMILY HAS SHOWN BIAS . PRIMARILY

MIDDLE-CLASS LANDOWNERS, VIETNAMESE CATHOLICS ARE ECONOMICALLY FAR MORE

ADVANCED THAN THE BUDDHISTS . THOUSANDS OF BUDDHISTS HAVE BECOME

CONVERTS TO CATHOLICISM IN THE HOPE THAT THIS WOULD HELP THEM

PROFESSIONALLY OR ECONOMICALLY . BUDDHISTS CLAIM THAT THE GOVERNMENT

GIVES CATHOLICS BETTER LAND FOR SCHOOLS AND CHURCH BUILDINGS AND

DISCRIMINATES AGAINST BUDDHIST STUDENTS IN GRANTING STATE SCHOLARSHIPS

. UNLIKE OTHER RELIGIOUS GROUPS, BUDDHISTS MUST HAVE SPECIAL GOVERNMENT

PERMITS TO HOLD LARGE MEETINGS . " THIS PUTS US IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS

THE TRADE UNIONS, " SAYS ONE BUDDHIST PRIEST . WITH THEIR FREE AND EASY

MORES, BUDDHISTS ALSO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE MORALITY CRUSADE OF MME . NGO

DINH NHU, WIFE OF DIEM'S BROTHER AND CLOSEST ADVISER . MME . NHU HAS

BANNED POLYGAMY, CONCUBINAGE, DANCING, AND EVEN FIGHTING FISH . HARD

LINE . ALL THESE DISCONTENTS NEED NOT HAVE ERUPTED IF GOVERNMENT TROOPS

HAD NOT STUPIDLY AND BRUTALLY GUNNED DOWN NINE BUDDHIST DEMONSTRATORS

AT A RALLY IN HUE TWO MONTHS AGO . EVEN THEN, THE BUDDHIST CONTROVERSY

WOULD PROBABLY HAVE DIED DOWN IF THE GOVERNMENT HAD OFFERED A PUBLIC

APOLOGY, WHICH IS THE BUDDHISTS' CHIEF DEMAND, ALONG WITH SUCH

PRACTICAL MATTERS AS FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY, THE RIGHT TO FLY THEIR FLAG,

BUDDHIST CHAPLAINS IN THE ARMY . BUT BROTHER NGO DINH NHU HAS ALWAYS

URGED A HARD LINE . WHAT HE FEARS WITH SOME REASON IS THAT IF DIEM

GIVES IN EVEN SLIGHTLY TO THE BUDDHISTS, IT WOULD ONLY CAUSE NEW

DEMANDS THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY THREATEN THE GOVERNMENT'S WHOLE POWER

STRUCTURE . BY WEEK'S END, HOWEVER, IN A BELATED ATTEMPT TO EASE

TENSIONS, THE GOVERNMENT ORDERED THE RELEASE OF 267 BUDDHISTS ARRESTED

DURING THE DEMONSTRATIONS . THOUGH HEAD PRIEST THICH TINH KHIET SAID

THAT HE HAS LOST CONFIDENCE IN DIEM'S " HIGH VIRTUE, " NO TOP BUDDHIST

HAS YET OPENLY ASKED FOR THE OVERTHROW OF THE DIEM GOVERNMENT . BUT A

NEW TYPE OF BUDDHIST LEADER IS EMERGING YOUNG, WELL-EDUCATED, TOUGH,

AND IMPATIENT WITH THE OLDER MEN'S RELATIVE RESTRAINT . AS PASSIONS

MOUNT AND THE POLICE CRACK DOWN HARDER, BUDDHISTS ARE BEING PUSHED INTO

A DANGEROUS ATTITUDE OF MARTYRDOM . " WE DON'T WANT A POLICE STATE, "

SAYS A BUDDHIST PRIEST . " WE DO NOT WANT TERROR OR DISCRIMINATION OR

STATE CONTROL . WE ARE LOYAL VIETNAMESE, BUT THE GOVERNMENT TREATS US

LIKE COMMUNISTS . WE ARE WILLING TO SACRIFICE OURSELVES AND TO DIE TO

BRING FREEDOM TO ALL THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH VIET NAM . " . . . (TRI-DOT)

THE COMMUNIST VIET CONG WAS OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO CAPITALIZE ON THE

BUDDHIST CRISIS . STEPPING UP THEIR ATTACKS, THE RED GUERRILLAS WOUNDED

14 U.S . ADVISERS IN A MORTAR BARRAGE ON A U.S . COMPOUND IN CAN THO

AND KILLED THREE AMERICANS WHEN THE REDS SHOT UP A U.S . MEDICAL CONVOY

NORTH OF SAIGON . A FOURTH ADVISER WAS KILLED LATER IN THE WEEK WHEN

JITTERY SENTRIES BEGAN SHOOTING AT EACH OTHER IN THE DARK . THE DEAD

BROUGHT TO 89 THE NUMBER OF U.S . TROOPS KILLED IN THE WAR IN SOUTH

VIET NAM .

BLOODLESS VICTORY . THE LOSERS ARE THEN JAILED OR EXILED TO WELLPAYING

TWELFTH ATTEMPTED COUP D'ETAT IN 14 YEARS AND THE ONLY ONE TO THROW

STAGED AN UNSUCCESSFUL COUP LAST YEAR, A BAND OF ARMY OFFICERS AND

DEFENSE MINISTER AND ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF, BROADCAST THAT THE EFFORT "

TO DISTURB THE PEACE " HAD BEEN CRUSHED . NEXT DAY HE ANNOUNCED THE

BREAK IN THE RULES OF SYRIAN-STYLE COUPS : EIGHT REBEL MILITARY MEN

AND TWELVE CIVILIANS HAD BEEN EXECUTED . HAFEZ BLAMED THE REVOLT ON

SYRIAN SUPPORTERS OF EGYPT'S GAMAL ABDEL NASSER, WHO IS FEUDING WITH

BAATH-RULED SYRIA OVER CONTROL OF THE PROPOSED NEW ARAB FEDERATION BUT

MIDEASTERN OBSERVERS COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY NASSERITES WOULD BEGIN A

REVOLT ON THE VERY DAY THAT SYRIA'S PRESIDENT LOUAI ATASSI WAS FLYING

CONCEDED THAT SYRIA WAS AT LAST READY TO ACCEPT NASSER'S DEMAND FOR A "

NATIONAL FRONT " FEDERATION IN WHICH HIS SUPPORTERS WOULD HAVE EQUAL

STRENGTH WITH BAATH . AFTER A TEN-HOUR CONFERENCE WITH NASSER,

PRESIDENT ATASSI FLEW HOME AND RUSHED TO THE MILITARY HOSPITAL TO KISS

ESPIONAGE MISTAKEN IDENTITIES LATEST INSTALLMENTS OF TWO

INTERNATIONAL SPY CASES : IN LONDON'S OLD BAILEY, A JURY PONDERED THE

CROWN'S CASE AGAINST ITALIAN NUCLEAR SCIENTIST GIUSEPPE MARTELLI,

INCLUDING THE ELABORATE ESPIONAGE EQUIPMENT FOUND IN HIS POSSESSION AND

HIS REPEATED CONTACTS WITH KNOWN SOVIET AGENTS . DEFENDANT MARTELLI

READILY ADMITTED MOST OF THE CROWN'S CHARGES, BUT EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD

MERELY BEEN STRINGING OUT THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE REDS IN ORDER TO

DENOUNCE THEM AT THE RIGHT MOMENT TO BRITISH AUTHORITIES . AFTER

DELIBERATING FOR NINE HOURS AND 47 MINUTES, THE JURORS DECIDED TO

BELIEVE MARTELLI AND DECLARED HIM NOT GUILTY . IN BOTH LONDON AND

MOSCOW, THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE CONFUSION ABOUT THE IMPORTANT SOVIET

OFFICIAL WHO DEFECTED TO THE WEST 18 MONTHS AGO, WAS THOROUGHLY

INTERROGATED IN THE U.S., AND IS NOW A RESIDENT OF BRITAIN . THE MAN'S

NAME WAS GIVEN AS ANATOLY DOLNYTSIN, AND THE DAILY TELEGRAPH ALERTLY

NOTED THAT A DIPLOMAT OF THE SAME NAME HAD SERVED FOR NINE MONTHS IN

THE SOVIET EMBASSY IN LONDON . MOSCOW'S IZVESTIA THEN GOT INTO THE ACT,

INSISTING THAT, FAR FROM DEFECTING, DOLNYTSIN HAD LEFT HIS LONDON POST

IN 1961 AND HAD BEEN WORKING EVER SINCE AT THE FOREIGN MINISTRY IN

MOSCOW (TO PROVE ITS POINT, IZVESTIA EVEN PUBLISHED HIS PICTURE) .

QUESTIONS RAISED IN BRITAIN'S HOUSE OF COMMONS GOT ONLY AN

ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT SOMEBODY DID DEFECT FROM RUSSIA 18 MONTHS AGO AND

HAD BEEN GIVEN ASYLUM IN BRITAIN . POSSIBLY, THERE HAD BEEN TWO RUSSIAN

OFFICIALS WITH THE SAME OR SIMILAR NAMES . NOW WILL THE REAL ANATOLY

DOLNYTSIN PLEASE STAND UP ?

GREAT BRITAIN THE SAGA OF POLISH PETER LIKE THE OVERTURNING OF A

DEEPLY EMBEDDED ROCK, THE PROFUMO SCANDAL CAUSED A FRANTIC SCURRYING OF

A GREAT MANY ODD HUMAN INSECTS . ONE OF THE CRAWLIEST FIGURES TO EMERGE

WAS THAT OF PETER RACHMAN, WHO MAY, OR MAY NOT, BE DEAD . LAST WEEK

PRESS AND PARLIAMENT WERE ABUZZ WITH HIS SORDID STORY . RACHMAN LOOKED

THE PART OF AN IAN FLEMING VILLAIN . SHORT AND FAT, WITH GROTESQUELY

TINY HANDS AND FEET, HE HAD NO NECK, A BALD HEAD SHAPED LIKE A SOCCER

BALL, AND SUNKEN BLUE EYES ALWAYS HIDDEN BEHIND DARK GLASSES . HE

DRESSED FLASHILY, WORE ELEVATOR SHOES OF CROCODILE LEATHER . IT AMUSED

HIM TO WATCH NAKED LADY WRESTLERS, AND HE HAD A FETISH ABOUT HYGIENE,

INSISTING THAT ALL HIS SILVERWARE BE STERILIZED AND UNTOUCHED BY HUMAN

HANDS . MORE THAN MOST MEN, RACHMAN LOVED MONEY AND WOMEN . WHITE CHIEF

. IN 1946, WHEN HE WAS 26, POLISH-BORN RACHMAN HAD ARRIVED IN BRITAIN

VIRTUALLY PENNILESS AND POSSESSING A STATELESS PERSON'S PASSPORT . AT

FIRST, HE FOUND POSTWAR BRITAIN A BLEAK PLACE . HIS ENGLISH WAS POOR,

AND HE LABORED AS KITCHEN HELPER, INSURANCE AGENT AND BLACK MARKETEER .

HE MADE HIS BID FOR FORTUNE IN THE EARLY 1950S BY BORROWING $2,500 TO

BUY A LODGING HOUSE NEAR LONDON'S HARROW ROAD . THE HOUSE COST SO

LITTLE BECAUSE SEVEN OF ITS EIGHT ROOMS WERE OCCUPIED BY TENANTS

PROTECTED BY RENT CONTROL AND IMMUNE FROM EVICTION . RACHMAN RENTED THE

ONE EMPTY ROOM TO A PARTY OF EIGHT WEST INDIAN MUSICIANS WHO WERE

ENCOURAGED TO HOLD NIGHTLONG PARTIES AND RAISE HELL ; THEY DID, TO

SUCH GOOD EFFECT THAT THE SEVEN WHITE TENANTS MOVED OUT WITHIN THREE

MONTHS AND WERE REPLACED BY SWARMS OF WEST INDIANS PAYING VASTLY

INFLATED RENTS . EIGHTEEN MONTHS LATER, RACHMAN SOLD THE HOUSE FOR FIVE

TIMES WHAT HE HAD PAID FOR IT, AND MOVED ON TO FURTHER REAL ESTATE

TRIUMPHS IN THE RUNDOWN AREAS OF PADDINGTON, BAYSWATER AND NOTTING HILL

. IN HIS SINGLE-MINDED EFFORT TO GET LOWRENT TENANTS OUT OF HIS HOUSES

AND HIGHRENT TENANTS IN, RACHMAN HIRED MEN TO URINATE IN HALLWAYS,

SMASH FURNITURE, AND ONCE IN BAYSWATER TO REMOVE THE ROOF OF A HOUSE

AND ABANDON THE STUBBORN TENANTS TO THE MERCY OF WIND AND WEATHER . IN

THE UNDERWORLD HE GOT THE NAME OF " POLISH PETER, " AND WEST INDIANS,

WHO KNEW HIS POWER, CALLED HIM " WHITE CHIEF RACHMAN MAN . " BENT

BASEMENT . THE RENT ACT OF 1957 VIRTUALLY LIFTED ALL CONTROLS AND

ENABLED RACHMAN TO SHOEHORN TENANTS INTO HIS FLATS AT WHATEVER PRICES

THE TRAFFIC WOULD BEAR . HE ALSO SHOWED TALENT FOR " BENDING THE

BASEMENT, " THAT IS, CONVERTING CELLAR SPACE INTO CRIBS FOR PROSTITUTES

OR INTO NIGHTCLUBS THE 1959 STREET OFFENCES ACT, WHICH DROVE

PROSTITUTES OFF LONDON PAVEMENTS, BROUGHT HIM ANOTHER WINDFALL, FOR THE

GIRLS WOULD PAY MORE FOR ROOMS THAN EVEN THE DESPERATE WEST INDIANS .

IN ONE HOUSE, SEVEN PROSTITUTES WERE CHARGED $10 PER DAY, PAYABLE EVERY

DAY AT NOON, OR $25,000 ANNUALLY, FOR A HOUSE VALUED AT $4,200 .

THE SAGA OF POLISH

PETER     RACHMAN WAS NEVER ONCE FOUND GUILTY OF AN ILLEGAL ACT, AND

NEVER ONCE PAID A PERSONAL INCOME TAX . POLICE AND PUBLIC HEALTH

OFFICERS NEARLY LOST THEIR MINDS TRYING TO TRACE THE TRUE OWNERSHIP OF

HIS 400 TO 500 BUILDINGS . THEY WOULD DISCOVER THAT IN A SINGLE RACHMAN

HOUSE DIFFERENT OWNERS WERE LISTED FOR DIFFERENT FLOORS ; ONE COMPANY

WOULD HAVE A LEASE TO COLLECT RENTS, ANOTHER TO MAKE REPAIRS, AND A

THIRD WOULD SIMPLY BE HOLDING THE HOUSE " IN TRUST " FOR ONE OF

RACHMAN'S MYRIAD FIRMS . BY 1959, RACHMAN HAD ENOUGH MONEY TO START

DEALING IN BETTER-CLASS APARTMENTS, HOTELS AND OFFICE BUILDINGS . HE

MARRIED AUDREY O'DONNELL, A PRETTY LANCASHIRE GIRL WHO HAD SERVED AS AN

OFFICER IN HIS MULTIPLE CORPORATIONS, AND MOVED INTO A MOCK-GEORGIAN

MANSION JUST OFF HAMPSTEAD HEATH'S MILLIONAIRES' ROW . THE GARAGE WAS

LARGE ENOUGH TO HOUSE THEIR SIX CARS . NUMBERS FAME . ALWAYS ON THE

LOOKOUT FOR GIRLS FOR HIS PERSONAL USE, RACHMAN FREQUENTLY VISITED THE

SEVERAL NIGHTCLUBS HE OWNED, AND WOULD SIT IN A CORNER LIKE A SATANIC

KEWPIE, A CIGAR IN HIS MOUTH, DIAMONDS ON HIS PUDGY FINGERS, A BLONDE

JUVENILE OBEDIENTLY AT HIS SIDE, AND A BODYGUARD IN THE BACKGROUND .

CHRISTINE KEELER WAS ONE OF HIS MANY MISTRESSES, AND IN OCTOBER 1960,

HE SET UP MANDY RICE-DAVIES, CHRISTINE'S SOMETIME ROOMMATE, IN A WEST

CASINO ONE NIGHT LAST NOVEMBER, RACHMAN FELT ILL . HE WAS RUSHED TO

EDGWARE GENERAL HOSPITAL, AND PERHAPS DIED OF A HEART ATTACK . ON HIS

WRIST WAS A GOLD BRACELET WHOSE INSIDE, AS A HOSPITAL ATTENDANT

DESCRIBED IT, WAS COVERED WITH SERIES OF NUMBERS THAT COULD BE EITHER

SAFE COMBINATIONS OR ACCOUNT NUMBERS IN SWISS BANKS . WHATEVER RACHMAN

DID WITH HIS REPUTED FORTUNE, OF $25 MILLION, IT WAS NOT FOUND IN HIS

PERSONAL ESTATE, WHICH CAME TO ABOUT $20,000 . RACHMAN'S OWN FATE IS AS

MYSTERIOUS AS HIS MISSING MONEY . THE LONDON UNDERWORLD BUZZES WITH

RUMORS THAT THERE WAS A BODY SWITCH AT EDGWARE, AND RACHMAN HAS

REPORTEDLY BEEN SEEN EVERYWHERE FROM MANHATTAN TO PARIS . THE QUESTION

WAS RAISED IN PARLIAMENT, BUT LAST WEEK SCOTLAND YARD AND INVESTIGATING

NEWSMEN WERE SATISFIED THAT THE REAL RACHMAN WAS DEAD AND THAT HIS

CORPSE LIES BURIED IN AN UNMARKED GRAVE IN A HERTFORDSHIRE CEMETERY .

WEST GERMANY THE OLDEST GRAD THE TALL, GANGLING YOUTH WITH THE

KAISER WILHELM MUSTACHE WAS A MODEL OF SELF-DISCIPLINE AT THE

UNIVERSITY OF FREIBURG . LIMITED TO A SMALL MONTHLY ALLOWANCE OF $21,

HE WAS NEVER KNOWN TO SQUANDER OR BORROW A PFENNIG . AT NIGHT, NODDING

OVER HIS LAW BOOKS, HE WOULD TAKE OFF HIS SHOES AND SOCKS, IMMERSE HIS

FEET IN A TUB OF COLD WATER TO STAY AWAKE . HE NEVER FOUGHT A DUEL, BUT

HE WAS NO SQUARE . HE PLEDGED A FRATERNITY, ACQUIRED THE " BIERNAME "

(DRINKING NICKNAME) OF " TONI, " AND AT FROTHY FUNCTIONS WOULD BANG HIS

STEIN ON AN OAK TABLE IN UNISON WITH THE REST OF THEM . LATER, IN

COLOGNE, HE DAZZLED THE FRAULEINS AT THE LOCAL PUDELNASS (SOPPING WET)

TENNIS CLUB . AMONG THOSE WHO KNEW HIM, MANY WERE SURPRISED WHEN KONRAD

ADENAUER (CLASS OF 1897) GREW UP TO BE A POLITICIAN AND EVENTUALLY

CHANCELLOR OF WEST GERMANY . LAST WEEK ADENAUER'S COLLEGE DAYS BECAME A

TOPIC OF NATIONAL DISCUSSION . ADDRESSING A NOSTALGIC REUNION OF ALTE

HERREN (OLD GRADS), THE CHANCELLOR DEFENDED GERMANY'S TRADITION OF

FRATERNITIES, WHICH ARE WIDELY ACCUSED OF FOSTERING AUTHORITARIANISM .

THOUGH AT 87 ADENAUER HAS SEEN MOST IF NOT ALL OF HIS OLD FRATERNITY

CLASSMATES DIE, HE IS STILL A LOYAL MEMBER OF ARMINIA (MOTTO : TRUE

! FREE ! ) . SAID DER ALTE : " WHEN A STUDENT ENTERS THE

UNIVERSITY, HE OR SHE IS NEITHER A FINISHED MAN NOR A FINISHED WOMAN .

ONE IS NEVER COMPLETELY FINISHED IN LIFE . A BOY NEEDS A SPECIAL

ATMOSPHERE . IT IS LIKE A PLANT THAT GROWS UP, OR A YOUNG TREE . IT

DEPENDS ON HOW THE AIR IS, ON THE SURROUNDINGS HE IS IN, ON THE EARTH

THAT GIVES HIM NOURISHMENT . I BELIEVE A STUDENTENKORPORATION

(FRATERNITY) CAN GIVE A YOUNG STUDENT A GREAT DEAL . I LOOK BACK AT MY

STUDENT TIME AND CAN ONLY SAY THAT THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH I FOUND IN THE

FRATERNITIES HAS AFFECTED ME FOR MY WHOLE LIFE . THE STUDENT CAN ONLY

BE RAISED BY THE FELLOWSHIP OF HIS PEERS . " AS FOR THE BURGEONING

REVIVAL OF FRATERNITIES SINCE WORLD WAR II (40 PER CENT OF WEST GERMAN

STUDENTS NOW BELONG), DER ALTE MAINTAINED THAT " AFTER THE TERRIBLE

COLLAPSE AT THE END OF THE WAR, THE RISE OF SUCH A TRADITION IS OF VERY

VITAL AND GREAT SIGNIFICANCE FOR ALL THE GERMAN PEOPLE . "     AFTER

HIS SPEECH, ADENAUER TOOK TIME TO INSPECT THE SPECIAL OFFICES IN BONN'S

PARLIAMENT BUILDING THAT ARE BEING MADE READY FOR HIM TO OCCUPY AFTER

HIS OFTPOSTPONED BUT NOW FIRMLY PROMISED RETIREMENT AS CHANCELLOR THIS

FALL . WHEN HE STEPS DOWN, ADENAUER IS SUPPOSED TO CONFINE HIMSELF TO

BEING A PARLIAMENTARY DEPUTY, NATIONAL CHAIRMAN OF HIS CHRISTIAN

DEMOCRATIC UNION AND THE OLDEST SURVIVING MEMBER OF ARMINIA .

NAMED FOR

THE TEUTONIC HERO ARMINIUS, WHOSE FORCES ANNIHILATED THREE ROMAN

FRANCE L'AMOUR FOR LA PATRIE THE PEOPLE OF PARIS CELEBRATED

SUMMER IN THE TRADITIONAL WAY . YOUNG COUPLES WERE LACED TOGETHER UNDER

THE TREES OF THE BOIS DE BOULOGNE, LOCKED LIP-TO-LIP ON THE METRO

STAIRS, SNUGGLED FLANK-TO-FLANK ON THE SWIMMING BARGES MOORED ALONG THE

SEINE . TO THE GAULLISTS IN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY THERE WAS ONLY ONE

THING WRONG WITH THIS SURFEIT OF LOVE : IT IS NOT PRODUCING ENOUGH

BABIES . INTRODUCING NEW LEGISLATION DESIGNED TO CHANGE THAT SITUATION,

EX-PREMIER MICHEL DEBRE WARNED : " THERE IS A DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE

LINK BETWEEN THE WEIGHT OF OUR POPULATION AND OUR FUTURE IN EUROPE AND

THE WORLD . " NO EXPLOSION . DEBRE COULD HAVE APPEALED TO HISTORY .

WHEN NAPOLEON'S ARMIES SWEPT OVER THE CONTINENT 160 YEARS AGO, FRANCE

CONTAINED ONE-FIFTH OF EUROPE'S POPULATION . TODAY IT REPRESENTS

ONE-TWENTIETH, AND ONLY IMMIGRATION HAS KEPT FRANCE FROM LOSING

POPULATION . SINCE 1946, FRANCE'S ANNUAL BIRTH RATE HAS STABILIZED AT

BETWEEN 18 AND 19 PER 1,000 PEOPLE . THOUGH WELL BELOW THE U.S . RATE

OF 23.4, FRANCE IS NOW ACTUALLY DOING BETTER THAN MOST OF ITS NEIGHBORS

. IN WESTERN EUROPE GENERALLY, THE BIRTH RATE HAS SLOWLY BUT STEADILY

DECLINED OVER THE PAST DECADE, POSSIBLY BECAUSE OF POSTWAR UNEASINESS

ABOUT THE FUTURE, THE SHORTAGE OF NEW HOUSING THAT CONTINUES DESPITE

THE ECONOMIC BOOM, AND THE DECISION OF NEWLYWEDS TO SPACE THE ARRIVAL

OF CHILDREN . THE DECLINE IS EVEN MORE RAPID IN THE COMMUNIST

COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY POLAND AND YUGOSLAVIA, WHERE THE RATE HAS DROPPED

FROM 28 TO 22 PER 1,000 IN THE SAME PERIOD, PARTLY BECAUSE COMMUNIST

GOVERNMENTS SANCTION LEGAL ABORTIONS . THUS, IRONICALLY, WHILE ASIA,

AFRICA AND SOUTH AMERICAN STILL FEAR THE POPULATION EXPLOSION, EUROPE

FEARS THE OPPOSITE . NO DRINKING . FRANCE HAS LONG FOUGHT THE TREND BY

OFFERING BONUSES FOR LARGE FAMILIES AND BY SEVERELY OUTLAWING ABORTIONS

AS WELL AS FEMALE CONTRACEPTIVE DEVICES AND THE SPREAD OF BIRTH CONTROL

INFORMATION . TO ACHIEVE A NATIONAL AVERAGE OF AT LEAST THREE CHILDREN

PER FAMILY, DEBRE LAST WEEK PROPOSED 1) PRIORITY IN APARTMENTS FOR

YOUNG COUPLES WITH CHILDREN, 2) TAX EXEMPTIONS TO FAMILIES IN THE YEAR

THEY PRODUCE A FOURTH CHILD, 3) A MORE " RECEPTIVE GOVERNMENT ATTITUDE

TOWARD UNWED MOTHERS . " HE ALSO WANTS FRENCHMEN TO LAY OFF THE BOTTLE,

BECAUSE " EACH GENERATION WE LOSE A TOTAL OF 500,000 PERSONS DUE TO

OVERINDULGENCE . " OPPOSITION CAME FROM SOCIALIST AND COMMUNIST

DEPUTIES WHO ARGUED THAT IT WAS UNREALISTIC TO TALK OF INCREASING THE

POPULATION WHILE FRENCH HOUSING REMAINED IN ITS PRESENT WRETCHED STATE

. BUT DEBRE IS STRONGLY BACKED BY PRESIDENT CHARLES DE GAULLE, WHO

HOPES THAT FRANCE'S PRESENT POPULATION OF 47 MILLION WILL GROW TO 100

MILLION BY THE CENTURY'S END .

MAU . IN 1961, A GOVERNOR OF KENYA LABELED KENYATTA " A LEADER TO

DARKNESS AND DEATH . " ON A LONDON VISIT IN 1962, KENYATTA WAS PELTED

WITH ROTTEN EGGS BY WHITE EXTREMISTS BRANDISHING PLACARDS READING, "

HANG KENYATTA ! " YET LAST WEEK, AS HIS COUNTRY'S NEWLY ELECTED PRIME

MINISTER, KENYATTA WAS A HERO TO MOST OF KENYA'S REMAINING WHITE

FARMERS . AT NAKURU, CAPITAL OF THE FORMER WHITE HIGHLANDS, 400 FARMERS

CROWDED THE TOWN HALL TO HEAR HIM, DETERMINED TO BASE THEIR DECISION TO

LEAVE KENYA OR TO STAY ON WHAT HE HAD TO TELL THEM (IN THE PAST TWO

YEARS, 6,000 HAVE LEFT, BUT 60,000 REMAIN) . KENYATTA APPEALED TO THE

WHITES TO FORGIVE AND FORGET, TO JOIN HANDS WITH HIS THREE-MONTH-OLD

AFRICAN GOVERNMENT AND PROVE THAT DIFFERENT RACIAL GROUPS CAN LIVE

HARMONIOUSLY TOGETHER . " THERE IS NO SOCIETY OF ANGELS, BLACK, BROWN

OR WHITE, " SAID KENYATTA . " WE ARE HUMAN BEINGS AND AS SUCH WE ARE

BOUND TO MAKE MISTAKES . IF I HAVE DONE A MISTAKE TO YOU, IT IS FOR YOU

TO FORGIVE ME . IF YOU HAVE DONE A MISTAKE TO ME, IT IS FOR ME TO

FORGIVE YOU . " HE ASSURED THE WHITE SETTLERS THAT THEY WOULD BE

ALLOWED TO FARM THEIR LAND WITHOUT INTERFERENCE, THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT

WILL USE IDLE LAND, AND PROMISED MORE POLICE ACTION TO PREVENT THE

STEALING OF CATTLE . WHEN HE FINISHED, THE WHITE FARMERS ROARED

KENYATTA'S BATTLE CRY OF " HARAMBEE ! " , A SWAHILI EXPRESSION

USHERED THE DIPLOMATS INTO A DAZZLING GOLD-AND-WHITE MARBLE ROOM IN THE

SPIRIDONOVKA PALACE . IN BOTH CITIES, AND IN LONDON AS WELL, THE

EMISSARIES OF NATION AFTER NATION LINED UP TO SIGN THE NUCLEAR TEST BAN

TREATY . EVENTUALLY, BY STATE DEPARTMENT ESTIMATE, THERE WILL BE MORE

THAN 100 SIGNATORIES . KHRUSHCHEV CALLED IT " A REFERENDUM ON ALL

NONSIGNERS . CHIEF AMONG THEM IS, OF COURSE, RED CHINA . HEIGHTENING

THEIR BITTER IDEOLOGICAL QUARREL WITH MOSCOW, THE CHINESE CHARGED THAT

FOUR YEARS AGO NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV HAD WELSHED ON A PROMISE TO HELP THEM

MAKE ATOMIC BOMBS BECAUSE HE WANTED TO PRESENT " A GIFT " TO PRESIDENT

EISENHOWER ON THE EVE OF THE CAMP DAVID TALKS . IN A BITTER RADIO

ATTACK, THE CHINESE SAID THAT THE " REAL AIM OF THE SOVIET LEADERS " IN

NEGOTIATING THE TEST BAN " IS TO COMPROMISE WITH THE U.S . IN ORDER TO

MAINTAIN A MONOPOLY OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND LORD IT OVER THE SOCIALIST

CAMP . " PEKING ADDED THAT KHRUSHCHEV HAD COMMITTED AN ACT OF "

BETRAYAL " RESULTING IN " OPEN CAPITULATION BY THE SOVIET LEADERS TO

U.S . IMPERIALISM . " THE SLOW ONES . CHINA'S ANTITREATY STAND WAS

BACKED BY AVOWEDLY PRO-PEKING ALBANIA, NORTH KOREA AND NORTH VIET NAM .

SO FAR, THESE ARE THE ONLY COUNTRIES THAT HAVE FORMALLY ANNOUNCED THAT

THEY WILL NOT SIGN . BUT CHARY OF ANGERING THE CHINESE, OTHER ASIAN

NATIONS HAVE BEEN SLOW TO INDICATE THEIR APPROVAL OF THE PACT . THEY

INCLUDE NEPAL, WHICH LIES IN AN EXPOSED POSITION IN CHINA'S BORDER

CONFLICT WITH INDIA ; CEYLON AND CAMBODIA, BOTH LEFTWING " NEUTRALS "

; AND INDONESIA, WHICH IS HOPEFUL OF CHINESE SUPPORT IN ANY FUTURE

ACTION AGAINST THE SOON-TO-BE-BORN MALAYSIAN FEDERATION . TO MOSCOW'S

FIDEL CASTRO IS STILL ANGRY OVER KHRUSHCHEV'S WITHDRAWAL OF SOVIET

ROCKETS LAST FALL . TRYING TO MAKE THE SOVIET LEADER SWEAT, CASTRO IS

OBVIOUSLY ATTEMPTING TO BOOST HIS PRICE FOR SUPPORTING RUSSIA IN ITS

STRUGGLE WITH THE CHINESE . BUT THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT THAT CUBA WILL

ULTIMATELY SIGN THE TREATY, FOR CASTRO NEEDS RUSSIA TO BUY HIS

3,800,000-TON SUGAR CROP AND TO CONTINUE STEADY TRANSFUSION OF ECONOMIC

AID . THE LONELY ONES . THE SOLE NONSIGNER IN THE WESTERN CAMP IS

FRANCE . EVEN FRANCO SPAIN, THE ONLY WESTERN COUNTRY WHICH DOES NOT

HAVE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH MOSCOW, HAS SIGNED THE TREATY, LEAVING

FRANCE ISOLATED FROM ALL ITS CONTINENTAL NEIGHBORS . MOST GALLING TO

CHARLES DE GAULLE WAS WEST GERMANY'S DECISION TO SIGN THE PACT AFTER A

REASSURING PITCH IN BONN BY U.S . SECRETARY OF STATE DEAN RUSK . BONN'S

ACTION WAS DOUBLY UPSETTING TO FRANCE, FOR IT FOLLOWED AN ANNOUNCEMENT

THAT GERMANY AND THE U.S . WILL COOPERATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW

BATTLE TANK (TIME, AUG . 16) ; JUST THREE MONTHS AGO, PARIS WAS UNABLE

TO REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH THE GERMANS ON A SIMILAR PROJECT . BOTH BONN

DECISIONS RAISED THE QUESTION OF JUST HOW MUCH THE FRANCO-GERMAN

FRIENDSHIP TREATY IS WORTH, AND BROUGHT INTO THE OPEN THE FACT THAT

WEST GERMANY STILL LOOKS TO THE U.S . AND NOT TO FRANCE FOR LEADERSHIP

. STUBBORNLY FRANCE PREPARED FOR ANOTHER ATOMIC TEST IN THE SAHARA, BUT

DE GAULLE'S ASPIRATIONS TO FRENCH LEADERSHIP OF EUROPE WERE ACIDLY

DEMOLISHED BY PARIS' LE FIGARO . " IF KHRUSHCHEV REALLY BECOMES

DISTURBED BY THE CAMPAIGN CONDUCTED AGAINST HIM BY CHINA, " SAID THE

PAPER, " AND IF HE WANTS TO HAVE A CERTAINTY OF PEACE ON HIS WESTERN

FRONT, THEN HE WILL NOT COME TO SEEK AGREEMENT WITH FRANCE, WHICH IS

NEGLIGIBLE IN HIS EYES, EVEN WITH ATOMIC WEAPONS, BUT WITH THE U.S.,

WHOSE INFLUENCE AND POWER ARE ONE HUNDRED TIMES SUPERIOR . THIS WAS

WEST GERMANY IT IS STILL THERE TWO YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE

BERLIN WAS SEVERED BY THE WALL . ON ITS ANNIVERSARY LAST WEEK, MOST

WEST BERLINERS HEEDED OFFICIAL APPEALS TO REFRAIN FROM VIOLENT, FUTILE

DEMONSTRATIONS . INSTEAD, THEY OBSERVED THE DAY QUIETLY BY PLACING

WREATHS ON THE DOZENS OF CROSSES MARKING EACH SPOT WHERE A FLEEING EAST

GERMAN HAD BEEN SHOT TO DEATH BY COMMUNIST GUARDS . ONLY LATE IN THE

EVENING WAS THE CITY'S GRAVE CALM BROKEN BY A MOB OF SOME 2,000

HELL-RAISING WEST BERLINERS WHO SURGED INTO THE AREA AROUND CHECKPOINT

CHARLIE, HURLING ROCKS AND INSULTS ACROSS THE WALL INTO THE SOVIET

SECTOR . IF GERMANS HAVE LEARNED TO LIVE WITH THE BERLIN WALL AND THE

DEADLY, 830MILE BARRICADE THAT DIVIDES THE REST OF THEIR NATION, ON

NEITHER SIDE HAVE THEY FORGOTTEN OR FORGIVEN ITS EXISTENCE . THE MOST

ELOQUENT EVIDENCE OF EAST GERMANS' REFUSAL TO ACCEPT SOVIETIZATION IS

THAT 16,456 OF THEM HAVE RISKED THEIR LIVES AND FLED TO THE WEST SINCE

THE WALL WENT UP . AMONG THEM WERE 1,304 MEMBERS OF EAST GERMANY'S ARMY

AND POLICE FORCE, ENOUGH TO FORM 13 COMPANIES . AT LEAST 65 MORE EAST

GERMANS ARE KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN KILLED WHILE ATTEMPTING TO ESCAPE .

FACTS OF LIFE . DESPITE THIS SOMBER CHRONICLE OF FLIGHT AND DEATH, MANY

POLITICIANS AND PUNDITS OUTSIDE GERMANY STILL CLING TO THE NOTION BASED

IN PART ON DEEP-ROOTED FEAR OF RESURGENT GERMAN POWER THAT ITS PEOPLE

ARE GRADUALLY BECOMING RECONCILED TO THEIR COUNTRY'S PARTITION . IN

WEST GERMANY ITSELF, THIS VIEW IS ACCEPTED IN SOME QUARTERS, MOSTLY

BECAUSE IT IS A FACT OF PRESENT EUROPEAN LIFE THAT THE RUSSIANS CANNOT

BE MOVED OUT OF EAST GERMANY, EXCEPT BY WAR, A WEST GERMAN SURRENDER TO

COMMUNISM, OR SOME KIND OF SETTLEMENT FOR WHICH WEST GERMANY MIGHT HAVE

TO PAY A RUINOUS PRICE . AS A RESULT, MANY GERMANS ARE BEGINNING TO

PONDER MEASURES THAT FALL SHORT OF ACTUAL REUNIFICATION SUCH AS TRADE

PRESSURE DESIGNED TO PERSUADE WALTER ULBRICHT TO GIVE EAST GERMANS A

LITTLE MORE FREEDOM AND A SOMEWHAT BETTER LIFE . FRANZ THEDIECK, STATE

SECRETARY FOR ALL-GERMAN AFFAIRS, SAID RECENTLY : " OF COURSE WE WOULD

LIKE TO SEE GERMANY REUNITED, BUT IF THERE WERE CONDITIONS OF FREEDOM

IN EAST GERMANY THE EXISTENCE OF ONE SINGLE GERMAN STATE WOULD NOT BE

ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY . " EXISTENTIAL PHILOSOPHER KARL JASPERS CREATED A

FUROR BY SUGGESTING IN 1960 THAT HIS COUNTRYMEN MUST ACCEPT CHANGES IN

THE MAP OF GERMANY AS PART OF THEIR LIABILITY FOR HITLER . MANY GERMANS

NOW ACCEPT HIS THOUGHT : " THE ONLY THING THAT COUNTS IS FREEDOM .

COMPARED WITH THAT, REUNIFICATION IS A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE THE

THOUGHT IS LARGELY ACADEMIC, SINCE IT WOULD BE ALMOST AS DIFFICULT TO

LIBERALIZE THE ULBRICHT REGIME AS TO GET THE RUSSIANS OUT OF EAST

GERMANY . THE JASPERS LINE THUS MAY TEMPER BUT DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE

BASIC URGE FOR REUNIFICATION IN A COUNTRY WHICH ACHIEVED NATIONAL UNITY

LATER THAN OTHER EUROPEAN NATIONS AND IS FIERCELY INSISTENT ON ITS

ETHNIC IDENTITY . HENCE BONN'S OPPOSITION TO ANY EAST-WEST AGREEMENT

THAT WOULD FORMALLY OR PSYCHOLOGICALLY SEAL THE STATUS QUO . SAYS A

WESTERN AMBASSADOR IN BONN : " THE ISSUE OF GERMAN UNITY STILL HAS

MORE EXPLOSIVE POTENTIAL THAN ANY OTHER ISSUE ON THE POLITICAL SCENE IN

GERMANY TODAY . WE'D BE FOOLS TO UNDERESTIMATE IT . " SHIFT TO RIGHT .

FAR FROM SYMBOLICALLY AND PHYSICALLY SEALING GERMANY'S DIVISION, THE

WALL HAS BECOME A CONSTANT, INESCAPABLE REMINDER TO WEST GERMANY'S 57

MILLION CITIZENS THAT 17 MILLION OF THEIR COMPATRIOTS LIVE IN PRIVATION

AND TERROR . OLDER GERMANS, INCLUDING DISTINGUISHED SOCIOLOGIST HELMUT

SCHELSKY, HAVE WARNED REPEATEDLY THAT A COMPLACENT YOUNGER GENERATION

WILL IN TIME COME TO REGARD THEIR COMPATRIOTS " OVER THERE " AS

FOREIGNERS . HOWEVER, GERMAN STUDENTS ON THE WHOLE SEEM TO AGREE WITH

CHRISTA ROLL, A 23-YEAR-OLD MUNICH STUDENT, WHO ARGUES THAT IDEALISTIC

YOUNGSTERS HAVE BEEN DEEPLY AFFECTED BY THE WALL . SINCE IT WENT UP,

SHE SAYS, " THE INTELLECTUAL CENTER OF GRAVITY HAS SHIFTED TO THE RIGHT

. BEFORE THAT, A LOT OF LIBERALS WOULD STILL PUT IN A GOOD WORD FOR

EAST GERMANY NOW AND THEN . BUT THE WALL CHANGED THEM, FOR IT WAS

EXACTLY THE KIND OF UGLY SUPPRESSION THAT EVERY PROGRESSIVE IS

SUPPOSEDLY FIGHTING AGAINST . " MOST GERMANS EVEN THOSE WHO ACKNOWLEDGE

THAT REUNIFICATION CANNOT BECOME REALITY IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE

AGREE THAT IT IS A MORAL IMPERATIVE . RECENT OPINION POLLS SHOW THAT 54

PER CENT OF WEST GERMANY'S CITIZENS CONSIDER THEIR COUNTRY'S DIVISION "

AN UNBEARABLE SITUATION . " ANOTHER SURVEY, TAKEN LAST YEAR, INDICATED

THAT 40 PER CENT CONSIDER REUNIFICATION THE NATION'S MOST URGENT

PROBLEM ; ONLY 17 PER CENT GAVE FIRST PRIORITY TO THE PRESERVATION OF

PEACE . EVIDENCE OF THEIR CONTINUING CONCERN FOR THEIR KIN IS THE RISE

IN WEST GERMANS' SHIPMENTS OF FOOD AND CLOTHING TO COMMUNIST GERMANY :

FROM 35 MILLION IN 1950, THE NUMBER OF PACKAGES CROSSING THE BORDER HAS

RISEN TO MORE THAN 52 MILLION A YEAR . A WHOLE NEW LITERATURE IN WEST

GERMANY CONCERNS ITSELF WITH THE ALIENATION OF EAST AND WEST, " THE

DREADED DREADFUL STRANGENESS, " AS UWE JOHNSON WROTE IN SPECULATIONS

ABOUT JAKOB, IN WHICH FRIENDS AND RELATIVES DIVIDED BY THE BORDER

GRADUALLY CEASE TO BE INDIVIDUALS IN EACH OTHER'S EYES, INSTEAD BECOME

POLITICAL SYMBOLS . EMOTIONALLY, AT LEAST, A UNITED NATION REMAINS THE

ASPIRATION OF A VAST MAJORITY OF WEST GERMANS . THE U.S . WOULD ONLY

PAVE THE WAY FOR A NEW AND DANGEROUS WAVE OF GERMAN NATIONALISM BY

IGNORING IT .

SUPERIOR TO THEIR DIALECTS OR NOT ? DOES THE RELIGION PREACHED BY THE

MISSIONARIES SURPASS FETISHISM OR NOT ? IS NOT BELONGING TO A NATION

OF CIVILIZED EXPRESSION AND WORLD PROJECTION BETTER THAN NARROW

REGIONALISM WITHOUT MEANS FOR DEFENSE OR PROGRESS ? " REASONABLE

QUESTIONS, TO BE SURE, BUT THEY SIMPLY CAME TOO LATE IN THE DAY AS DID

COOPERATION, IF THEY FIND IT USEFUL . " OTHERWISE, PORTUGAL WOULD

EVER CLOSER TO COMPLETE ONE-MAN RULE . LAST WEEK VENERABLE, AILING

EX-PREMIER FERHAT ABBAS, 63, QUIT HIS POST AS SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY

AND HANDED OUT A 15-PAGE CRITIQUE OF THE GOVERNMENT . HE WAS CHIEFLY

UPSET BECAUSE BEN BELLA KEEPS IGNORING THE ASSEMBLY, EVEN READ THE

COUNTRY'S NEW, STRONGLY CENTRALIZED CONSTITUTION TO A MEETING OF HIS

OWN FOLLOWERS AT AN ALGIERS MOVIE THEATER BEFORE SUBMITTING IT TO THE

DEPUTIES . ASKED ABBAS : " WHY SHOULD WE AGREE TO A CONSTITUTION THAT

HAS BEEN PROSTITUTED IN A CINEMA ? " ABBAS CONCEDED THAT BEN BELLA'S

REGIME IS NOT GOING COMMUNIST BUT WARNED THAT " WE DO SEEM TO BE

HEADING TOWARD A FASCIST DICTATORSHIP " . THOUGH BEN BELLA REMARKS

ACIDLY THAT " REVOLUTIONS ARE NOT HADE WITHOUT PRISONS, " BEN BELLISM

IS NOT FASCISM . CRITIC ABBAS WAS BLASTED AS A " BOURGEOIS SPOKESMAN

FOR PRIVILEGE " BY GOVERNMENT-RUN NEWSPAPERS AND DRUMMED OUT OF THE

NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, WHICH HE ONCE HEADED . BUT HE WAS PERMITTED

TO RETIRE QUIETLY TO HIS VILLA IN KOUBA, OUTSIDE ALGIERS, THEREBY

JOINING THE RANKS OF BEN BELLA'S OTHER MUFFLED BUT UNHARMED OPPONENTS,

SUCH AS MOHAMMED BOUDIAF, WHO IS UNDER HOUSE ARREST, AND EX-PREMIER

BENYOUSSEF BENKHEDDA, WHO HAS QUIT POLITICS TO RESUME HIS CAREER AS A

DRUGGIST .

LIECHTENSTEIN 2-12 THE HAPPY HAVE-NOT AT LAST COUNT, THERE WERE 72

PRINCES AND PRINCESSES OF LIECHTENSTEIN, WHICH IS ELEVEN MORE

HIGHNESSES THAN THERE ARE SQUARE MILES IN THE MINUSCULE PRINCIPALITY .

LUCKILY FOR THE POSTAL SYSTEM, ONLY A DOZEN VON UND ZU LIECHTENSTEINS

ACTUALLY LIVE IN LIECHTENSTEIN . INDEED, IT WAS NOT UNTIL 1937 THAT A

HEREDITARY RULER ACTUALLY MADE HIS HOME IN THE DRAFTY, 13TH CENTURY

FAMILY FORTRESS, WHOSE BATTLEMENTS RISE STARKLY ABOVE THE CAPITAL OF

VADUZ (PRONOUNCED VAHDOOTZ) . THERE LAST WEEK, AMID EULOGIES AND

THUNDEROUS RENDITIONS OF HEIL LIECHTENSTEIN, FRANZ JOSEF II MARIA ALOYS

ALFRED KARL JOHANNES HEINRICH MICHAEL GEORG IGNATIUS BENEDIKTUS

GERHARDUS MAJELLA, ITS TWELFTH REIGNING PRINCE, OBSERVED HIS 57TH

BIRTHDAY AND THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS ACCESSION TO THE THRONE . FOR

FEAR OF OVERCROWDING ITS POCKET PARADISE, LIECHTENSTEIN (POP . 18,000)

HAS GRANTED CITIZENSHIP TO ONLY A DOZEN FOREIGNERS SINCE 1950, AND

WORRIES MIGHTILY OVER ITS RISING BIRTH RATE . AN UNSULLIED BLEND OF

LUSH MEADOWLAND AND SOARING ALPINE PEAKS, THE NATION NESTLES SO

UNOBTRUSIVELY BETWEEN AUSTRIA AND SWITZERLAND (SINCE 1924 IT HAS SHARED

CURRENCY, CUSTOMS SERVICES AND FOREIGN SERVICE WITH THE SWISS) THAT

VACATIONERS DRIVING THROUGH ARE OFTEN UNAWARE THAT THEY ARE EVEN IN

FRANZ JOSEF'S FIEF . THIS BOTHERS LIECHTENSTEIN'S GOVERNMENT NOT AT

ALL, FOR, AS PRIME MINISTER ALEXANDER FRICK ONCE OBSERVED, THE SIGHT OF

IDLE TOURISTS COULD PROVE UNSETTLING TO THE COUNTRY'S HARD-WORKING

PEASANTS . SALAMI FOR RUBBERNECKS . EVEN TO SHUTTLE SUMMER TRAFFIC

THROUGH THE COUNTRY, LIECHTENSTEIN GRUDGINGLY HAS TO DOUBLE ITS POLICE

FORCE, WHICH CONSISTS NORMALLY OF 18 MEN AND A DOG NAMED REX . THE

WELL-NAMED QUICK TOURIST OFFICE CONCENTRATES ITS ENERGIES ON SELLING

VISITORS SWISS WATCHES, BELGIAN FRANCS AND LIECHTENSTEIN CUCKOO CLOCKS,

WHICH ARE MADE IN WEST GERMANY . SINCE THE COUNTRY'S MEDIEVAL CASTLES

BEAR SIGNS SAYING " NO CASTLE VISITING, " INSISTENT RUBBERNECKS USUALLY

GET TO SEE THE SALAMI SKIN FACTORY OR ELSE ONE OF TWO PLANTS WHERE

STRIKINGLY HEALTHY LIECHTENSTEINERS TURN OUT FALSE TEETH AND ARTIFICIAL

LIMBS FOR WORLD MARKETS . THOUGH IT BOASTS ONE OF THE WORLD'S HIGHEST

LIVING STANDARDS, GERMAN-SPEAKING LIECHTENSTEIN IS IN EVERY HAPPY SENSE

A HAVE-NOT NATION : IT HAS NO UNEMPLOYMENT, SLUMS, COMMUNISTS, CRIME,

TV OR RADIO STATION, AIRPORTS, DIVORCES OR BILLBOARDS . NEUTRAL IN BOTH

WORLD WARS, IT HAS HAD NO SOLDIERS SINCE 1939, WHEN THE ONLY REMAINING

WARRIOR DIED IN BED . ITS MAXIMUM INCOME TAX RATE IS 10 PER CENT ;

CORPORATE TAXES ARE SO LIBERAL THAT MORE THAN 2,000 FOREIGN FIRMS HAVE

REGISTERED HEADQUARTERS IN VADUZ . WHILE IT IS A CONSTITUTIONAL

DEMOCRACY, LIECHTENSTEIN VIRTUALLY DISPENSES WITH POLITICS . THERE ARE

TWO PARTIES, KNOWN AS THE REDS AND THE BLACKS, BUT THEY ARE EQUALLY

CONSERVATIVE AND ANTI-COMMUNIST AND EVEN HAVE THE SAME MOTTO : FAITH

IN GOD, PRINCE AND FATHERLAND . PRIVATE LEONARDO . LIECHTENSTEIN ALSO

HAS CONSIDERABLE FAITH IN ITS WINE, A STURDY ROSE THAT THE GOVERNMENT

REFUSES TO EXPORT FOR FEAR OF RUNNING DRY . AN EVEN MORE JEALOUSLY

GUARDED NATIONAL TREASURE IS FRANZ JOSEF'S FAMILY ART COLLECTION (TIME,

DEC . 12, 1960), WHICH CONSISTS OF 1,500 PAINTINGS VALUED AT $150

MILLION . IT INCLUDES THE ONLY LEONARDO DA VINCI IN PRIVATE OWNERSHIP,

A LUSH PORTRAIT OF A FLORENTINE MAIDEN CALLED THE GINEVRA DEI BENCI, AS

WELL AS 27 RUBENS PAINTINGS THAT ARE VALUED AT $11 MILLION, AND

PAINTINGS BY VAN DYCK, BRUEGHEL, REMBRANDT AND BOTTICELLI . THE PUBLIC

IS ALLOWED TO SEE ONLY 75 OF FRANZ JOSEF'S LESSER PICTURES, WHICH ARE

SANDWICHED INTO A MODEST BUILDING IN VADUZ ALONG WITH THE TOURIST

OFFICE AND THE NATIONAL POSTAGE-STAMP MUSEUM . THE CLOSEST THE

LIECHTENSTEIN FAMILY COMES TO SHARING ITS GREATEST PAINTINGS WITH THE

WORLD IS ALLOWING THEM TO APPEAR OCCASIONALLY ON ONE OF THE NATION'S

FAMED POSTAGE STAMPS . DESPITE POSTWAR LOSSES OF VAST HOLDINGS IN

COMMUNIST CZECHOSLOVAKIA, FRANZ JOSEF II IS RANKED AMONG EUROPE'S TEN

RICHEST MEN . A GRAND-NEPHEW OF AUSTRIAN ARCHDUKE FRANZ FERDINAND,

WHOSE ASSASSINATION AT SARAJEVO IGNITED WORLD WAR I, THE ALERT,

EASYGOING PRINCE IS ALSO RATED LIECHTENSTEIN'S MOST POPULAR MONARCH

SINCE JOHANNES THE GOOD, WHO TOOK THE THRONE IN 1858, REIGNED 71

YEARS, AND SPENT AN IMPRESSIVE $18 MILLION OF HIS PERSONAL FORTUNE TO

BUILD SCHOOLS AND ROADS IN LIECHTENSTEIN . THOUGH NO ONE EXPECTED FRANZ

JOSEPH TO SPEND AS MUCH, LOYAL LEICHTENSTEINERS WHO CROWDED INTO THE

PALACE LAST WEEK PRAYED LUSTILY THAT THE PRINCE AND HIS BEAUTIFUL,

41-YEAR-OLD WIFE, PRINCESS GINA, MIGHT REIGN AS LONG AS JOHANNES . "

WHEN THE PERSONALITY CULT GOES, " MURMURED ONE DEVOTED BYSTANDER, "

LIECHTENSTEIN GOES TOO . " LONGER

THAN ANY OTHER EUROPEAN MONARCH SAVE FRANCE'S LOUIS XIV, WHO BEAT HIM

BY A YEAR .

INDIA THUNDER ON LEFT & RIGHT ON THE EVE OF THE 16TH ANNIVERSARY

OF INDIAN INDEPENDENCE, 2,000 DEMONSTRATORS MARCHED OUTSIDE PARLIAMENT

IN DELHI, WAVING BANNERS AND CHANTING : " LEAVE THE THRONE, JAWAHARLAL

. " INSIDE THE HORSESHOE-SHAPED CHAMBER, PRIME MINISTER JAWAHARLAL

NEHRU FACED THE FIRST NO-CONFIDENCE MOTION IN HIS 16 YEARS IN POWER .

THE CENSURE MOTION WAS SPONSORED BY NEHRU'S MOST OUTSPOKEN POLITICAL

FOE, STOOPED, ACERBIC J . B . KRIPALANI, A POLITICAL INDEPENDENT WHO

WAS RETURNED TO PARLIAMENT ONLY TWO MONTHS AGO IN A SURPRISING

BY-ELECTION VICTORY, AFTER HAVING BEEN SWAMPED BY NOW DISCREDITED

EX-DEFENSE MINISTER KRISHNA MENON IN LAST YEAR'S GENERAL ELECTION .

KRIPALANI PROPOSED TO CENSURE THE GOVERNMENT AMONG OTHER THINGS, OVER

OFFICIAL CORRUPTION, SPIRALING FOOD PRICES AND PROHIBITIVELY HIGH

TAXATION . THOUGH KRIPALANI IS PRO-WESTERN, THE CENSURE PROPOSAL BECAME

AN UMBRELLA FOR ALL KINDS OF OTHER NEHRU CRITICS, INCLUDING LEFTISTS

ANGERED BY NEHRU'S FEW TENTATIVE STEPS AWAY FROM NONALIGNMENT . ONE

MAJOR LEFTIST TARGET WAS INDIA'S AGREEMENT TO PERMIT VOICE OF AMERICA

BROADCASTS FOR THREE HOURS DAILY OVER A TRANSMITTER TO BE BUILT BY THE

U.S . IN CALCUTTA, AND NEHRU IS NOW TRYING TO BACK OUT OF IT . ANOTHER

TARGET : THE JOINT AIR DEFENSE EXERCISES THAT THE INDIAN AIR FORCE

WILL SOON HOLD WITH THE U.S . AND BRITISH AIR COMMANDS . IN AN EFFORT

TO SILENCE HIS LEFTIST CRITICS, NEHRU HAS WON EXTENSIVE PROMISES FROM

RUSSIA AND ITS SATELLITES FOR MISSILES, FIGHTERS, AND SMALL ARMS . TOP

GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS EXPECT LITTLE IN SUBSTANCE FROM SOVIET AID

PROMISES, BUT INSIST THAT THE SYMBOLISM OF SUCH AID IS NECESSARY TO

MAINTAIN INDIA'S IMAGE OF NONALIGNMENT . WITH NEHRU'S CONGRESS PARTY

HOLDING A MASSIVE 229-SEAT PLURALITY IN PARLIAMENT, THERE IS NO CHANCE

THAT THE CENSURE MOTION WILL BE CARRIED . BUT NEHRU IS PLAINLY WORRIED

OVER THE RISING OPPOSITION ON BOTH THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT AND OVER THE

BY-ELECTION TREND AWAY FROM THE PARTY IN WHAT WERE ONCE CONSIDERED

IMPREGNABLE CONGRESS CONSTITUENCIES . HE HAS PROMISED TO SHAKE UP HIS

GOVERNMENT AND TO DEMAND THE RESIGNATION OF SOME CABINET MINISTERS SO

THAT THEY CAN WORK FULL TIME ON ORGANIZATIONAL DUTIES TO REVITALIZE THE

PARTY . NEHRU'S PLAN IS SCORNED BY C . RAJAGOPALACHARI, 84, LEADER OF

INDIA'S SMALL DYNAMIC, FREE-ENTERPRISING SWANTANTRA PARTY . "

THEATRICALS DO NOT CURE DISEASES, " SAYS C . R . " THE CONGRESS PARTY

IS SICK, AND I DO NOT WANT SICK PERSONS IN CHARGE OF THE GOVERNMENT . "

SOUTH VIET NAM SUICIDE SERIES IT WAS THE MOST MACABRE WEEK IN

SOUTH VIET NAM'S THREE-MONTH-OLD RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL CRISIS . IN

SAIGON, AN 18-YEAR-OLD GIRL TRIED UNSUCCESSFULLY TO CUT OFF HER LEFT

HAND " AS A HUMBLE OFFERING TO BUDDHA WHILE OUR RELIGION IS IN DANGER .

/ OUTSIDE THE COASTAL CITY OF HUE, A 17-YEAR-OLD NOVICE BUDDHIST MONK

WRAPPED HIMSELF IN A KEROSENE-SOAKED, SIX-COLOR BUDDHIST FLAG, THEN

STRUCK A MATCH . IN THE VILLAGE OF NINHHOA, 200 MILES NORTH OF SAIGON,

A YOUNG BUDDHIST NUN SAT DOWN IN A CATHOLIC SCHOOL PLAYGROUND AND SET

HERSELF ON FIRE . LESS THAN 24 HOURS LATER, BACK IN HUE, A 71-YEAR-OLD

MONK ANNOUNCED OVER THE TUDAM PAGODA LOUDSPEAKER THAT HE WAS GOING TO

KILL HIMSELF, THEN BURNED HIMSELF TO DEATH IN THE PAGODA'S COURTYARD .

THE QUARREL SPREADS . THE

THREE RITUALISTIC SUICIDES BROUGHT TO FIVE THE NUMBER OF BUDDHISTS WHO

HAVE TURNED THEMSELVES INTO HUMAN TORCHES IN FURTHER PROTEST AGAINST

THE REGIME OF SOUTH VIET NAM'S ROMAN CATHOLIC PRESIDENT NGO DINH DIEM .

THE GOVERNMENT REACTED BY PLACING THE BUDDHIST STRONGHOLDS OF HUE AND

NHATRANG UNDER VIRTUAL MARTIAL LAW . ALTHOUGH WORRIED THAT THE BURNINGS

MIGHT GET OUT OF HAND, BUDDHIST LEADERS DEFENDED THE SUICIDES AS "

NOBLE SACRIFICES, " WERE ROUNDING UP SECULAR AND MILITARY SUPPORT .

LEAFLETS CONTAINING WESTERN PRESS ACCOUNTS OF THE CONTROVERSY WERE

BEING DISTRIBUTED TO ARMY UNITS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY . SOLDIERS AND

PEASANTS BEGAN WEARING SAFFRON PATCHES THE SAME COLOR AS A MONK'S ROBES

TO INDICATE THEIR SUPPORT OF THE BUDDHISTS . IN ONE DIVISION MESS,

CATHOLIC AND BUDDHIST OFFICERS BEGAN EATING APART, AND AT A MILITARY

TRAINING SCHOOL, BUDDHIST CADETS DEMANDED A CHAPEL SIMILAR TO THE

CATHOLIC CHAPEL . BUDDHIST LEADERS SAID THEY WOULD NOT AGREE TO ANY

CONCILIATION UNTIL THE GOVERNMENT MADE SEVERAL CONCESSIONS, AND

ACCEPTED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE 13 BUDDHISTS' BEING SHOT DOWN AT A

RELIGIOUS DEMONSTRATION IN HUE LAST MAY . BUT DIEM IS STILL HOPEFUL

THAT THEY WILL AGREE TO SOME DISCUSSION AND MEDIATION . IMPLIED REBUKE

. THE PRESIDENT'S APPARENT READINESS TO MEET WITH THE BUDDHISTS IS

BITTERLY OPPOSED BY HIS SISTER-IN-LAW, MME . NGO DINH NHU, WHO HAS

CONSISTENTLY URGED THAT THE BUDDHIST OPPOSITION BE CRUSHED . " IF THE

PRESIDENT KEEPS BOWING TO THE BUDDHISTS, " SHE SAID, " THEY WILL KEEP

RIGHT ON TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS WEAKNESS TO MAKE NEW, IMPOSSIBLE

DEMANDS . THEY ARE UTTERLY HYPOCRITICAL . " WITH WHAT SOUNDED LIKE A

REBUKE TO MME . NHU, DIEM COUNTERED : " IT IS ONLY BECAUSE SOME HAVE

CONTRIBUTED, EITHER CONSCIOUSLY OR UNCONSCIOUSLY, TO RAISING DOUBTS

ABOUT THIS GOVERNMENT'S POLICY THAT THE SOLUTION TO THE BUDDHIST AFFAIR

HAS BEEN RETARDED . THE POLICY OF UTMOST CONCILIATION IS IRREVERSIBLE .

/ IN WASHINGTON, WHERE HENRY CABOT LODGE WAS GETTING HIS FINAL

BRIEFINGS BEFORE LEAVING TO TAKE OVER AS NEW U.S . AMBASSADOR IN

SAIGON, SECRETARY OF STATE DEAN RUSK DECLARED HIMSELF " DEEPLY

DISTRESSED " OVER THE CRISIS AND THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECT IT WAS HAVING

ON THE WAR AGAINST THE COMMUNIST VIET CONG . SAID RUSK : " WE HOPE THE

GOVERNMENT OUT THERE WILL TAKE A STRONG LEAD TO BRING ABOUT A GREATER

THE FAITH

THAT LIGHTS THE FIRES THE READINESS OF SOUTH VIET NAM'S BUDDHIST MONKS

AND NUNS TO BURN THEMSELVES TO DEATH AS A MEANS OF PROTEST AGAINST THE

GOVERNMENT BOTH MOVES AND REPELS THE WEST . ON THE SURFACE, IT SEEMS AN

ODD PHENOMENON IN A RELIGION GENERALLY REGARDED AS PASSIVE, GENTLE AND

FULL OF REVERENCE FOR LIFE . THE PARADOX IS CAUSED BY THE FACT THAT

BUDDHISM, THOUGH DETACHED AND OTHERWORLDLY, CAN AT TIMES CONVULSE

ITSELF INTO ACTION, AND THAT ITS VIEW OF LIFE AS TRANSITIONAL CAN LEAD

TO AN ALMOST INDIFFERENT EMBRACE OF DEATH .SELF-IMMOLATION IS NOT

MERELY A SIT-IN CARRIED TO ORIENTAL EXTREMES . ALTHOUGH IT HAS NOT

OCCURRED OFTEN AND APPARENTLY NEVER BEFORE IN VIET NAM THE PRACTICE IS

DEEPLY LINKED TO THE BASIC NATURE OF BUDDHISM, THE WORLD'S FOURTH

LARGEST RELIGION . NIRVANA & DHARMA . BUDDHISM CONSISTS OF THREE

SPIRITUAL COMPONENTS, TWO TRADITIONS, AND A MULTIPLICITY OF SECTS . THE

FIRST OF THE THREE COMPONENTS, COMMON TO ALL BUDDHISTS, IS THE

LEGENDARY LIFE OF A HANDSOME INDIAN PRINCE NAMED GAUTAMA, WHO, ABOUT

600 YEARS BEFORE CHRIST, ABANDONED HIS LUXURIOUS EXISTENCE AFTER SEEING

FOUR FACTS OF LIFE FOR THE FIRST TIME : A SICK MAN, AN OLD MAN, A DEAD

MAN AND A HOLY MAN . HE FLED TO THE FOREST TO SEEK ENLIGHTENMENT, TRIED

AND ABANDONED THE WAYS OF THE HERMIT AND THE ASCETIC, AND, AFTER

MEDITATING UNDER A SACRED BODHI TREE FOR 49 DAYS, AT LAST ACHIEVED

BUDDHAHOOD ENLIGHTENMENT, OR NIRVANA . HE SPENT THE REST OF HIS LIFE

WALKING THROUGH INDIA WITH HIS DISCIPLES, TEACHING UNTIL HE DIED AT 80,

LEAVING A FINAL ADMONITION : " WORK OUT YOUR SALVATION WITH DILIGENCE

. " GAUTAMA'S TEACHING, THE SECOND CHIEF COMPONENT OF BUDDHISM, IS

SUMMED UP IN THE FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS : 1) MAN SUFFERS ALL HIS LIFE, AND

GOES ON SUFFERING FROM ONE LIFE TO THE NEXT ; 2) THE ORIGIN OF MAN'S

SUFFERING IS CRAVING FOR PLEASURE, FOR POSSESSIONS, FOR CESSATION OF

PAIN ; 3) THE CURE FOR CRAVING IS THE PRACTICE OF NONATTACHMENT TO

EVERYTHING EVEN TO THE SELF ; 4) THE WAY TO NONATTACHMENT IS THE

EIGHTFOLD PATH RIGHT VIEWS, RIGHT INTENTIONS, RIGHT SPEECH, RIGHT

CONDUCT, RIGHT LIVELIHOOD, RIGHT EFFORT, RIGHT MINDFULNESS, RIGHT

MEDITATION . THE BUDDHA SAID NOTHING ABOUT GOD ; NO DIVINE JUDGMENT,

BUT AN INEXORABLE LAW OF CAUSE AND EFFECT CALLED DHARMA DETERMINES

MAN'S WEAL OR WOE . THIRD ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF BUDDHISM IS THE VAST

BODY OF MONKS AND NUNS CALLED THE SANGHA . IN ADDITION TO CELIBACY AND

VEGETARIAN NONVIOLENCE, MONKS PRACTICE POVERTY ; TRADITIONALLY THE

ONLY POSSESSIONS PERMITTED ARE ROBES, A BEGGING BOWL FOR FOOD, A

NEEDLE, PRAYER BEADS, A RAZOR (TO SHAVE THE HEAD ONCE A FORTNIGHT), AND

A FILTER TO REMOVE BUGS FROM THE DRINKING WATER SO AS NOT TO KILL THEM

. GREATER & LESSER VEHICLES . THE TWO GREAT BUDDHIST TRADITIONS ARE

HINAYANA AND MAHAYANA . HINAYANA, THE SO-CALLED LESSER VEHICLE, IS

GENERALLY MORE AUSTERE AND UNCOMPROMISING ; IT HOLDS THAT ONLY MONKS

AND NUNS HAVE HOPE OF REACHING NIRVANA . MAHAYANA, THE GREATER VEHICLE,

OFFERS HOPE OF ENLIGHTENMENT TO LAYMEN AS WELL, AND STRESSES THE

COMPASSIONATE CONCERN OF THE BUDDHA FOR HUMANITY . THE HIGHEST MAHAYANA

IDEAL IS THE BODHISATTVA, OR ENLIGHTENED ONE, WHO SACRIFICES HIMSELF

FOR OTHERS, AND MAHAYANA MYTHOLOGY CONTAINS NUMEROUS EXAMPLES OF

SACRIFICES AS AN ACT OF LOVE AS WELL AS A MEANS OF LIBERATION . ZEN

BUDDHISM, ONE OF THE SUBDIVISIONS OF MAHAYANA, IMPORTED BY THE JAPANESE

FROM CHINA, EMPHASIZES A COMBINATION OF PROLONGED MEDITATION AND SHOCK

TO ACHIEVE SATORI, OR ENLIGHTENMENT .

VIET NAM'S

BUDDHISM, LIKE CHINA'S AND JAPAN'S, IS PREDOMINANTLY MAHAYANA, AND THE

SUICIDE MONKS AND NUNS KNEW THE NUMEROUS LEGENDS OF BODHISATTVAS'

PHYSICAL SACRIFICES, SUCH AS THAT OF THE HOLY MAN WHO GAVE HIS BODY TO

A FAMISHED TIGRESS TO KEEP HER FROM EATING HER CUBS . SOME MAHAYANA

MONKS STILL AID THEIR LIBERATION FROM THE BODY BY BURNING THE FINGERS

OFF THEIR LEFT HANDS, AND IN THE 6TH CENTURY BEFORE GASOLINE MONKS WHO

DECIDED TO IMMOLATE THEMSELVES COMPLETELY WOULD EAT WAXY AND FATTY

FOODS FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS SO THEY WOULD BURN BETTER . THEORETICALLY

BUDDHISM DOES NOT PERMIT SUICIDE, AND THE WORD IS CAREFULLY AVOIDED IN

FAVOR OF " SACRIFICE . " ONE OF GAUTAMA'S TESTAMENTS, THE LOTUS SUTRA,

AS INTERPRETED BY MONKS IN SAIGON, CALLS FOR ALL BUDDHISTS TO SACRIFICE

THEMSELVES IF THEIR RELIGION IS IN DANGER . ONE EARLY BUDDHIST MARTYR,

IT IS SAID, TOOK HIS LIFE BY FIRST PUNCHING HIS BODY FULL OF HOLES AND

SEALING THEM WITH OIL, THEN SETTING FIRE TO HIMSELF . FEASTS & MAGIC .

THE GRASS-ROOTS MAHAYANA BUDDHISM IN THE VIET NAM VILLAGES IS A LONG

WAY FROM SUCH GRIM PRACTICES . IT USUALLY TAKES THE FORM OF THE

EASYGOING AMIDISM, IN WHICH A PARADISE CALLED " PURE LAND " AWAITS THE

INTENSE FAITHFUL WHO REPEATS A SIMPLE PRAYER . IT IS STRONGLY

INFLUENCED BY THE MAGICAL PRACTICES OF CORRUPTED TAOISM, IMPORTED FROM

CHINA AROUND THE 7TH CENTURY, AND BY CONFUCIANISM, WHICH STRESSES

ETHICAL BEHAVIOR . CONFUCIUS EMPHASIZED FAMILY OBLIGATIONS, EVIDENT

STILL IN VIET NAM'S ANCESTOR WORSHIP AND CULT OF THE DEAD . THE 15TH

DAY OF THE SEVENTH MONTH IS SET ASIDE ANNUALLY FOR THE DEPARTED ; THE

SHADES SWOOP DOWN UPON THE LIVING, WHO DO THEIR BEST TO PLACATE THEM

WITH A SUMPTUOUS FEAST . DRESSED IN THEIR BEST BLACK SILK AND CARRYING

BURNING JOSS STICKS, THE WOMEN RECITE INVITATIONS TO THEIR DEAD

ANCESTORS TO PARTAKE OF ROAST PIG'S HEAD AND STICKS OF SUGAR CANE,

PEANUTS AND WHITE RICE . AS OFFERINGS TO LESS TRENCHER-MINDED SPIRITS,

THEY BURN PAPER IMITATIONS OF CURRENCY AND CLOTHES . CRUSADER & YOGI .

IN MANY WESTERN EYES, BUDDHISM IS SOCIALLY USELESS . IT HAS ONLY A

LIMITED TRADITION OF GOOD WORKS ; THE CHIEF DUTY OF MONKS AND NUNS IS

CONTEMPLATION . IN THE LOTUS AND THE ROBOT, ARTHUR KOESTLER SAYS OF

ORIENTAL MYSTICISM IN GENERAL : " THE MESIANIC ARROGANCE OF THE

CHRISTIAN CRUSADER IS MATCHED BY THE YOGI'S ARROGANT ATTITUDE OF

DETACHMENT TOWARDS HUMAN SUFFERING . " ACTUALLY, BUDDHISTS ARE QUITE

CAPABLE OF THE CRUSADING SPIRIT . IN CEYLON DURING THE 2ND CENTURY

B.C., A KING LED HIS ARMY AGAINST INDIAN INVADERS WITH A RELIC OF

BUDDHA IN HIS SPEAR . IN VIET NAM AND ELSEWHERE, BUDDHISTS OFTEN TOOK

AN ACTIVE PART IN FIGHTING AGAINST COLONIAL POWERS . DURING THE KOREAN

WAR, AT LEAST SOME BUDDHISTS WERE PREACHING THAT " TO WIPE OUT THE

AMERICAN IMPERIALIST DEMONS IS NOT ONLY BLAMELESS BUT MERITORIOUS . "

IGNORING THE CHINESE COMMUNISTS' CRUEL PERSECUTION OF BUDDHISM IN

TIBET, SOME BUDDHISTS REASON (AS ONE SCHOLAR PUTS IT) THAT WHEN THE

MARXISTS' MATERIAL NEEDS ARE SATISFIED, THEY WILL " NEED SOMETHING

SPIRITUAL ABOVE AND BEYOND, " AND THAT BUDDHISM WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPLY

IT . IT IS THIS SORT OF SELF-DELUSION EXISTING ALONGSIDE BUDDHISM'S

NOBILITY OF SPIRIT THAT MAKES THE EIGHTFOLD PATH SO FULL OF PITFALLS .

IN THE BACKGROUND, GUNFIRE MINGLED WITH THE CONFUSED SCREAMS OF

BUDDHIST MONKS AND NUNS AND THE CLANGING ALARM OF THE HUGE BRASS GONG

THAT HANGS IN THE BELL TOWER OF SAIGON'S LARGEST PAGODA . SUDDENLY THE

PHONE CONNECTION FROM THE TEMPLE WENT DEAD . IT WAS 12 : 20 A.M .

USING THEIR RIFLE BUTTS AS CLUBS, SQUADS OF TOUGH, RIOTTRAINED "

SPECIAL FORCES " SMASHED INTO THE PAGODA, BATTERING A PATH THROUGH A

SMALL GUARD OF YOUNG BUDDHIST MONKS . THE TROOPERS HAD A LIST, AND EACH

MONK ON THE LIST WAS CONSIDERED TO BE A " COMMUNIST IN DISGUISE . " ON

THE TEMPLE'S SECOND FLOOR, ONE MONK TRIED TO RESIST AND WAS THROWN

BODILY FROM A BALCONY TO THE COURT-YARD 20 FT . BELOW . OTHER MONKS AND

NUNS WERE ROUTED FROM BEHIND A FLIMSY BARRICADE OF WOODEN BENCHES AND

FORCED OUTSIDE BY TEAR GAS AND GUNSHOTS . SACKING THE PAGODA'S MAIN

ALTAR, THE RAIDERS CARTED AWAY THE CHARRED HEART OF BUDDHIST MARTYR

HIMSELF TO DEATH IN PROTEST AGAINST THE DIEM GOVERNMENT'S ANTIBUDDHIST

DRIVE . BUT THE BUDDHISTS MANAGED TO SPIRIT OUT OF THE BUILDING THE

RECEPTACLE HOLDING QUANG DUC'S ASHES . " THE ASHES ARE HOLY, " SAID ONE

MONK . " WE WOULD GIVE 15 LIVES TO DEFEND THEM . " TWO OTHER MONKS

ESCAPED OVER THE BACK WALL OF XA LOI (PRONOUNCED SAH LOY) INTO THE

GROUNDS OF THE ADJOINING U.S . AID MISSION, WHERE THEY WERE GIVEN

TEMPORARY SANCTUARY . TO THE DIEM GOVERNMENT, THE CRACKDOWN OBVIOUSLY

SEEMED NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE REGIME AND ENFORCE THE LAW OF THE LAND

AGAINST BUDDHIST DEFIANCE . BUT IT WAS BRUTAL, NONETHELESS, AND IT

AROUSED A STRONG NEW WAVE OF SYMPATHY FOR THE BUDDHISTS . IT ALSO PUT

U.S . POLICY IN SOUTH VIET NAM, WHICH INVOLVES THE LIVES AND SAFETY OF

14,000 U.S . TROOPS, INTO AN AGONIZING DILEMMA . WHILE OFTEN UNHAPPY

WITH DIEM, THE U.S . HAS PROCEEDED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT IT WAS SAFER

TO STICK WITH HIM THAN RISK THE CHAOS THAT MIGHT SURROUND A SWITCH TO A

NEW, UNKNOWN AND UNPREDICTABLE REGIME . BUT BY HIS MOVE AGAINST THE

BUDDHIST MONKS, WHO HAVE THE GROWING SUPPORT OF THE COUNTRY'S VAST

BUDDHIST MAJORITY, ROMAN CATHOLIC DIEM MAY FINALLY HAVE SHATTERED HIS

OWN POLITICAL USEFULNESS . HE ALSO OPENED UP THE POSSIBILITIES OF

COUPS, COUNTER-COUPS, AND EVEN CIVIL WAR FROM ALL OF WHICH ONLY THE

COMMUNIST VIET CONG COULD BENEFIT . BOOLA, BOOLA . UNTIL LAST WEEK,

PRODDED BY THE U.S., DIEM HAD DISPLAYED AN APPARENT WILLINGNESS TO

CONCILIATE THE BUDDHISTS . FEELING BETRAYED BY DIEM'S CRACKDOWN, ONE

RANKING U.S . EMBASSY OFFICER SAID : " ALL THE TIME THEY'VE BEEN

PREACHING CONCILIATION TO US, THEY'VE EVIDENTLY BEEN PLANNING JUST THE

OPPOSITE . " THE BUDDHIST CRISIS HAD BEGUN AS A RELIGIOUS ONE, BUT

GRADUALLY TURNED INTO A MAJOR POLITICAL CONFLICT . THE BUDDHISTS ARE

FAR FROM PASSIVE MARTYRS . THEIR RELIGIOUS AND SOCIAL DEMANDS A FAIRLY

MODEST PACKAGE DEMANDING FULL EQUALITY WITH THE COUNTRY'S ROMAN

CATHOLICS HAD NEVER SOUNDED CRUCIAL, ESPECIALLY SINCE EVEN DIEM'S WORST

ENEMIES COULD NOT POINT TO ANY REAL ANTI-BUDDHIST DISCRIMINATION OR

PERSECUTION . BUT WHEN GOVERNMENT TROOPS STUPIDLY KILLED 13 BUDDHISTS

IN A DEMONSTRATION IN HUE (PRONOUNCED WHEY) FOUR MONTHS AGO, THE

BUDDHISTS MADE THE CLEARLY POLITICAL DEMAND THAT THE GOVERNMENT ACCEPT

/ RESPONSIBILITY " FOR THE INCIDENT . SINCE THEN, THE BUDDHISTS HAVE

DEVELOPED INTO A SERIOUS OPPOSITION MOVEMENT . PAGODAS, SPORTING

PROTEST SIGNS IN VIETNAMESE AND ENGLISH, BECAME COMMAND POSTS WHERE

DUPLICATING MACHINES GROUND OUT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MESSAGES, AND

THE SOUND OF TYPEWRITERS AND TELEPHONES BLENDED WITH THE BOOM OF TEMPLE

GONGS . APPEALS FOR AID WERE BROADCAST TO PRESIDENT KENNEDY, POPE PAUL

VI, AND U.N . SECRETARY-GENERAL U THANT . AT A GRISLY, WELL-ORGANIZED

PRESS CONFERENCE IN SAIGON, BUDDHIST LEADERS INTRODUCED A TINY,

WITHERED BUDDHIST NUN AS A CANDIDATE FOR SELF-IMMOLATION IN PROTEST

AGAINST THE DIEM GOVERNMENT . WHEN ONE BUDDHIST SPOKESMAN WHO HAD

STUDIED AT YALE WANTED TO PASS OUT THE LATEST COMMUNIQUES FROM THE

PAGODA, HE WOULD STROLL UP TO A YALE-EDUCATED U.S . NEWSMAN AND SAY :

/ BOOLA, BOOLA . /

IN THE EARLY PHASES OF THE QUARREL, DIEM

PROBABLY COULD AND SHOULD HAVE CONCILIATED THE BUDDHISTS . BUT HE

VACILLATED . HIS BROTHER AND SISTER-IN-LAW, NGO DINH NHU AND MME . NHU,

INSISTED THAT UNLESS THE BUDDHISTS WERE CRUSHED, THERE WOULD BE A COUP

THREATENING THE VERY EXISTENCE OF THE FAMILY'S RULE . MME . NHU'S FIERY

PHILIPPICS LENT IMPETUS TO THE BUDDHIST MOVEMENT JUST AS IT APPEARED TO

BE FLAGGING . BY LAST WEEK, AFTER THREE BUDDHIST SUICIDES SPURRED NEW

PROTEST DEMONSTRATIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, IT WAS CLEARLY TOO LATE

FOR CONCILIATION . EVEN IF DIEM HAD WANTED IT, THE BUDDHIST LEADERS

THEMSELVES NO LONGER WANTED IT ; THEY WERE PLAINLY DETERMINED TO PRESS

THEIR ADVANTAGE . AND SO THE GOVERNMENT EVIDENTLY YIELDED TO NHU'S

GET-TOUGH POLICY . ROPE TRICK . THE CRACKDOWN IN SAIGON WAS DUPLICATED

ALL OVER SOUTH VIET NAM, AND MORE THAN 1,000 PEOPLE WERE IMPRISONED .

IN THE BUDDHIST STRONGHOLD OF HUE, THE APPROACH OF GOVERNMENT TROOPS

WAS SIGNALED BY THE BEATING OF TEMPLE DRUMS AND THE CLASHING OF CYMBALS

CALLING FOR HELP . BEATING POTS AND PANS TO ROUSE THEIR NEIGHBORS, THE

ANGRY POPULACE POURED FROM HOMES AND RACED TO DEFEND THE CITY'S TEMPLES

. AT TU DAM PAGODA, MONKS TRIED TO TURN THE COFFIN OF A PRIEST WHO HAD

BURNED HIMSELF ALIVE IN THE BUDDHIST SUICIDE PROTEST WAVE . BUT

GOVERNMENT SOLDIERS, FIRING M1 RIFLES AS THEY ADVANCED, OVERRAN THE

TEMPLE, SNATCHED THE SMOLDERING COFFIN AWAY, AND SMASHED A STATUE OF

GAUTAMA BUDDHA . FROM THE TEMPLE'S TREASURY THEY TOOK AN ESTIMATED

$30,000 AND LEFT THE PAGODA A GUTTED RUIN . NEAR HUE'S DIEU DE PAGODA,

THE GOVERNMENT FORCES MET THEIR FIRST DETERMINED RESISTANCE . AS TROOPS

TRIED TO STRETCH A BARBED-WIRE BARRICADE ACROSS THE BRIDGE LEADING TO

THE TEMPLE, A MOB TORE IT DOWN WITH BARE HANDS . WITH FISTS, ROCKS AND

SHARPENED STICKS, THE CROWD FOUGHT THE HEAVILY ARMED TROOPS FOR THE

BRIDGE . TEAR-GAS GRENADES THROWN BY THE SOLDIERS WERE CAUGHT AND

THROWN RIGHT BACK AT THEM . WHEN TROOPS TRIED TO CLEAR A WAY THROUGH

THE BRIDGE DEFENDERS WITH THEIR RIFLE BUTTS, THE CROWD TORE THE WEAPONS

FROM THEIR HANDS AND JABBED THE SOLDIERS IN THE GROIN . AFTER A

FIVE-HOUR PITCHED BATTLE, THE GOVERNMENT FINALLY WON CONTROL OF THE

BRIDGE AT DAYBREAK BY DRIVING ARMORED CARS THROUGH THE SCREAMING,

SPITTING, SWEARING MOB . THE DEFENSE OF THE BRIDGE AND THE TEMPLE COST

THE TOWNSPEOPLE AN ESTIMATED 30 DEAD AND 200 WOUNDED . TEN TRUCKLOADS

OF BRIDGE DEFENDERS WERE CARTED AWAY TO JAIL, MANY STREAMING BLOOD, AND

AN ESTIMATED 500 PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED THROUGHOUT THE CITY, INCLUDING 17

OF THE 47 HUE UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS WHO HAD RESIGNED EARLIER IN THE

WEEK IN PROTEST AGAINST THE FIRING OF THE SCHOOL'S RECTOR, A CATHOLIC

PRIEST AND AN OPPONENT OF DIEM'S BROTHER, ARCHBISHOP NGO DINH THUC .

THOUGH A 24-HOUR CURFEW WAS CLAMPED ON HUE, THE CITY'S RESIDENTS WERE

STILL DEFIANT . ONE BUDDHIST MONK FLED THROUGH THE STREETS HOTLY

PURSUED BY THREE GOVERNMENT TROOPERS . THE PRIEST RACED DOWN AN ALLEY

AT WHOSE ENTRANCE SAT AN AGED VIETNAMESE WOMAN . AS THE SOLDIERS TURNED

INTO THE ALLEY, THE WOMAN PULLED TIGHTLY ON A ROPE STRETCHED ACROSS THE

STREET, BRINGING ALL THREE SOLDIERS TUMBLING DOWN . THEN SHE SCUTTLED

AWAY TO SAFETY . ARTICLE 44 . AT 6 A.M., RADIO SAIGON CRACKLED TO LIFE

AND PRESIDENT DIEM CAME ON THE AIR . " UNDER ARTICLE 44 OF THE

CONSTITUTION, " HE SAID, " I DECLARE A STATE OF SIEGE THROUGHOUT THE

NATIONAL TERRITORY . I CONFER UPON THE ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC OF VIET NAM

THE RESPONSIBILITY TO RESTORE SECURITY AND PUBLIC ORDER SO THAT THE

STATE MAY BE PROTECTED, COMMUNISM DEFEATED, FREEDOM SECURED, AND

DEMOCRACY ACHIEVED . " UNDER THE MARTIAL LAW PROCLAMATION, THE ARMY WAS

GIVEN BLANKET SEARCH-AND-ARREST POWERS AND EMPOWERED TO FORBID ALL

PUBLIC GATHERINGS, RESTRICT PRESS FREEDOM, AND PROHIBIT THE CIRCULATION

OF ALL " PRINTED MATERIAL AND OTHER DOCUMENTS HARMFUL TO PUBLIC ORDER

AND SECURITY . " IN SAIGON THE ARMY IMPOSED A TIGHT 9 P.M.-TO-5 A.M .

CURFEW . CARRYING AUTOMATIC WEAPONS AND RIFLES WITH FIXED BAYONETS,

TROOPS IN FULL CAMOUFLAGE BATTLE DRESS GUARDED EVERY MAJOR BRIDGE AND

INTERSECTION . TIGHT CENSORSHIP WAS CLAMPED ON ALL OUTGOING NEWS, AND

REPORTERS WERE FORCED TO GIVE THEIR STORIES TO TRAVELERS FLYING TO

NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES OR TO FLY OUT THEMSELVES WITH THEIR COPY .

TELEPHONE SERVICE IN THE HOMES AND OFFICES OF ALL U.S . MILITARY AND

EMBASSY PERSONNEL WAS CUT OFF .

THE POLITICAL

REPERCUSSIONS BEGAN AT ONCE . PROTESTING THE GOVERNMENT'S ACTION,

FOREIGN MINISTER VU VAN MAU QUIT HIS POST, SHAVED HIS HEAD AND

ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD GO TO INDIA TO BECOME A CONTEMPLATIVE BUDDHIST

MONK . SOUTH VIET NAM'S AMBASSADOR TO WASHINGTON, TRAN VAN CHUONG, WHO

IS MME . NHU'S FATHER, ALSO QUIT, WITH A SHARP DENUNCIATION OF HIS

DAUGHTER'S POLICIES AND OF THE DIEM GOVERNMENT FOR " COPYING THE

TACTICS OF TOTALITARIAN REGIMES . " AS LONG AS DIEM STAYS IN POWER, HE

ADDED, THERE IS " NOT ONE CHANCE OF WINNING THE WAR AGAINST THE

COMMUNISTS .

IN SAIGON MORE THAN 500

UNIVERSITY OF SAIGON MEDICAL STUDENTS BOYCOTTED CLASSES AND HELD

TURBULENT ANTI-GOVERNMENT MEETINGS . WHEN A PROFESSOR TRIED TO RIP DOWN

A PRO-BUDDHIST POSTER, HE WAS STONED BY STUDENTS . THROUGHOUT THE CITY,

MARTIAL LAW POSTERS WERE SURREPTITIOUSLY DEFACED OR TORN AWAY .

STUDENTS JEERED AT SOLDIERS PATROLLING THE STREETS : " WHY DON'T YOU

GO BACK TO FIGHTING THE VIET CONG ? " THE GOVERNMENT RETALIATED

AGAINST STUDENT UNREST BY CLOSING ALL SAIGON'S SCHOOLS . THE UGLY

AMERICAN . THE CRACKDOWN IN SOUTH VIET NAM CAUSED CONSTERNATION IN

WASHINGTON . IN A BLUNT CONDEMNATION THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAID THAT

SAIGON'S STRONG-ARM TACTICS REPRESENTED " A DIRECT VIOLATION BY THE

VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT OF ASSURANCES THAT IT WAS PURSUING A POLICY OF

RECONCILIATION TOWARD THE BUDDHISTS . THE U.S . DEPLORES REPRESSIVE

ACTIONS OF THIS NATURE . " THE MOVE AGAINST THE BUDDHISTS WAS OBVIOUSLY

TIMED TO BE OVER AND DONE WITH BEFORE U.S . AMBASSADOR HENRY CABOT

LODGE ARRIVED IN SAIGON . WHEN IT HAPPENED, LODGE WAS IN JAPAN . ON THE

WAY OUT FROM SAN FRANCISCO BY COMMERCIAL JET, HE HAD FOUND HIMSELF

ACROSS THE AISLE FROM NOVELIST EUGENE BURDICK, CO-AUTHOR OF THE UGLY

AMERICAN, AND THAT SELF-APPOINTED EXPERT ON U.S . ERRORS IN THE FAR

EAST OFFERED THE AMBASSADOR A HALF-HOUR BRIEFING, TO WHICH LODGE

LISTENED DIPLOMATICALLY . THE GIST : DON'T RELY ON EMBASSY OFFICERS,

CONSULT SEASONED NEWSMEN, BEWARE OF COMMUNICATIONS BLOCKS IN THE

EMBASSY, GET FIGHTER COVER FOR THOSE COMBAT HELICOPTERS . ON ORDERS

FROM PRESIDENT KENNEDY, LODGE CUT SHORT HIS STAY IN JAPAN, AND BY

HASTILY COMMANDEERED U.S . AIR FORCE DC-6 PROCEEDED AT ONCE TO SAIGON,

WHERE HE WAS MET BY A VIETNAMESE PROTOCOL OFFICER, EMBASSY OFFICIALS

AND GENERAL PAUL HARKINS, COMMANDER OF THE U.S . TROOPS IN SOUTH VIET

NAM . AS IF TO DRAMATIZE U.S . DISAPPROVAL OF THE GOVERNMENT ACTION,

LODGE WENT TO THE U.S . AID MISSION BUILDING TO TALK TO THE TWO MONKS

WHO HAD BEEN GIVEN SANCTUARY . IGNORING DEMANDS THAT THE MONKS BE

TURNED OVER TO VIETNAMESE AUTHORITIES, LODGE ORDERED THE U.S . STAFF TO

GET SOME VEGETABLES FOR THE VEGETARIAN PRIESTS . ANTI, ANTI, ANTI .

WHAT TO DO NEXT WAS A QUESTION THICKLY CLOUDED FOR BOTH LODGE AND

WASHINGTON BY CONFUSION OVER PRECISELY WHO WAS IN CONTROL OF THE

SITUATION IN SOUTH VIET NAM . DIEM STILL SEEMED IN COMPLETE CHARGE AND

IN A CABLE TO THE NEW YORK HERALD TRIBUNE'S MARGUERITE HIGGINS HE

DECLARED, " I TRUST IN THE ARMY AND IN FACT I MAINTAIN CONTROL OVER THE

SITUATION . " BUT IT LOOKED INCREASINGLY LIKELY THAT THE KEY FIGURE

BEHIND THE GOVERNMENT'S MOVE HAD BEEN BROTHER NHU, HEAD OF THE

10,000-STRONG SPECIAL FORCES AND SECRET POLICE . FOR WEEKS THERE HAD

BEEN HINTS THAT HE MIGHT TRY A COUP OF HIS OWN SUPPOSEDLY TO FORESTALL

THE ANTI-DIEM COUP THAT HE KEPT PREDICTING UNLESS THE BUDDHISTS WERE PUT

DOWN . ANY CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT POLICY, HE HAD WARNED, WOULD BE "

ANTI-BUDDHIST, ANTI-AMERICAN, ANTI-WEAKNESS . /

THE CRACKDOWN IT WAS NHU'S

SPECIAL FORCES THAT SACKED THE PAGODAS ; REGULAR ARMY TROOPS WERE ONLY

CALLED IN AFTER THE JOB WAS DONE TO HELP KEEP ORDER . THEORETICALLY,

UNDER THE MARTIAL LAW PROCLAMATION, IT IS NOW THE ARMY THAT RUNS THE

COUNTRY, AND, AGAIN THEORETICALLY, DIEM PLACED TOP AUTHORITY IN MAJOR

GENERAL TRAN VAN DON, 46, A HIGHLY RESPECTED, ONETIME CORPS COMMANDER

WHO HAS HAD GREAT MILITARY SUCCESS AGAINST THE VIET CONG . BUT DON MAY

MERELY BE A FIGUREHEAD HOSTILE TO THE GOVERNMENT, HE WAS PULLED OUT OF

HIS FIELD COMMAND LAST DECEMBER AND KICKED UPSTAIRS TO A STAFF JOB,

WHERE HE WOULD HAVE NO TROOPS AT HIS DISPOSAL IN CASE THE THOUGHT OF A

COUP EVER CROSSED HIS MIND . DIEM AND NHU EVIDENTLY INTENDED TO VEST

REAL MILITARY POWER IN ANOTHER, VERY DIFFERENT OFFICER, WHOSE LOYALTY

THE NGO FAMILY CAN COUNT ON, COLONEL LE QUANT TUNG, COMMANDER UNDER NHU

OF THE SPECIAL FORCES . A DEVOUT CATHOLIC, TUNG COMES FROM CENTRAL VIET

NAM, BIRTHPLACE OF THE NGO FAMILY, APPARENTLY HAS NO POLITICAL

AMBITIONS, AND WAS ONCE A TOP OFFICIAL IN NHU'S SECRET ORGANIZATION,

THE CAN LAO PARTY . AS LONG AS A MONTH AGO, LARGE UNITS OF SPECIAL

FORCES WERE MOVED INTO SAIGON UNDER COLONEL TUNG'S COMMAND . THE BIG

QUESTION IS WHETHER TUNG CAN KEEP CONTROL AND WHETHER THE REGULAR ARMY

WILL GO ALONG OR WILL TURN AGAINST THE REGIME . THE COURSE OF EVENTS .

AFTER NINE YEARS OF ABSOLUTE POWER, THE NGO FAMILY HAD TAKEN A

CONSIDERABLE RISK IN LETTING SO MUCH AUTHORITY SLIP FROM ITS HANDS

UNDER THE MARTIAL LAW PROCLAMATION . TAKING OVER THE FUNCTIONING OF ALL

GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES, THE ARMY FOR THE FIRST TIME HAS A VIABLE POWER

STRUCTURE OF ITS OWN . IT MAY WELL STAY LOYAL AS LONG AS DIEM REMAINS

IN THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE, BUT NHU IS VASTLY UNPOPULAR WITH MOST OF

THE MILITARY COMMANDERS EXCEPT TUNG . THE ARMY IMMEDIATELY TRIED TO

DISSOCIATE ITSELF FROM THE BUDDHIST CRACKDOWN . ALL OFFICIAL BULLETINS

FROM THE ARMY-CONTROLLED GOVERNMENT INFORMATION CENTER POINTEDLY

MENTIONED THAT NHU'S SPECIAL FORCES, AND NOT THE ARMY, HAD WRECKED THE

PAGODAS . BUT HAVING DISCOVERED THAT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR POWER NOW

EXISTS OUTSIDE THE NGO FAMILY, VARIOUS MILITARY FACTIONS MAY WELL BEGIN

TO JOCKEY FOR SOLE AUTHORITY . AT WEEK'S END, ACCORDING TO ONE REPORT,

THIS FEAR WAS REALIZED AT THE SMALL TOWN OF MY THO, JUST SOUTH OF

SAIGON, WHERE BUDDHIST AND CATHOLIC TROOPS TURNED ON EACH OTHER . IN

THE FIELD, ACTION AGAINST THE VIET CONG HAS COME TO A VIRTUAL

STANDSTILL . " THIS WRECKS THE ARMY'S EFFORTS AGAINST THE REDS, " SAID

A SENIOR U.S . INTELLIGENCE OFFICER . " THEY'RE TOO BUSY ENFORCING

CURFEWS TO FIGHT . HOW THE REDS MUST BE LOVING THIS . " MORE THAN EVER,

DIEM'S GOVERNMENT OR ANY OTHER IN SOUTH VIET NAM DEPENDS ON U.S .

BACKING . YET EVEN IF WASHINGTON SHOULD OFFICIALLY DECIDE THAT DIEM HAS

BECOME A LIABILITY IN THE FIGHT AGAINST THE VIET CONG, THE U.S . WILL

NOT SUPPORT A CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT WHILE THE POWERS IN SAIGON ARE STILL

SETTLING ACCOUNTS AMONG THEMSELVES . SAID ONE WASHINGTON OFFICIAL : "

WHEN THE RUMBLING OF OPPOSITION STARTS WITHIN A REGIME OF THIS SORT,

YOU CAN'T  TELL WHERE EVENTS ARE GOING TO TAKE IT . /

ASIAN NATION WAS QUIETLY GOING FROM BAD TO DISASTROUS . BURMA'S

BUSINESS IS VIRTUALLY AT A STANDSTILL, CREDIT IS NONEXISTENT, FOREIGN

INVESTMENT HAS VANISHED ALL BECAUSE DICTATOR NE WIN INSISTS ON INSTANT,

TOTAL SOCIALISM . BURMA HAS 1,370 MILES OF MOUNTAINOUS BORDER WITH RED

IN SUCH PROXIMITY TO COMMUNISM IS LIKE WALKING A TIGHTROPE IN A TYPHOON

HOSTILE TOWARD THE U.S., FRIENDLY TOWARD CHINA (WITHOUT, HOWEVER,

ENDORSING PEKING'S ATTACK AGAINST INDIA), FRIENDLIER TOWARD MOSCOW AND,

OF COURSE, ACCEPTING AID FROM ALL THREE . BUT DOMESTICALLY, THE TYPHOON

IS CAUSING HAVOC . NATIONALIZATION . ENERGETIC DICTATOR NE WIN, WHO IS

BANKS . BRITAIN'S PRESTIGIOUS LLOYD'S BANK WAS RENAMED PEOPLE'S BANK NO

FALLEN 40 PER CENT IN THREE MONTHS AND URBAN UNEMPLOYMENT HAS SOARED .

THE FEW REMAINING PRIVATE COMPANIES ARE CLAMORING FOR NATIONALIZATION,

HOPING TO GET A BETTER BREAK ON RAW MATERIAL ALLOCATIONS AND SOME

PROTECTION AGAINST STRIKES . BECAUSE THERE ARE TOO FEW TRAINED

ADMINISTRATORS TO RUN ANY MORE ENTERPRISES, NE WIN LAST WEEK WAS FORCED

TO REFUSE ALL FUTURE NATIONALIZATION PETITIONS . ALTHOUGH IN THE PAST

THE GOVERNMENT ENCOURAGED WORKERS TO STRIKE AGAINST PRIVATE EMPLOYERS

IN STATE-RUN BUSINESSES, STRIKES ARE CONSIDERED UNPATRIOTIC NE WIN LAST

WEEK URGED LABOR TO MODERATE ITS WAGE DEMANDS, IN A BELATED ATTEMPT TO

PACIFY BUSINESSMEN . INSURRECTION . WHILE CRIPPLING THE ECONOMY, NE WIN

HAS BEEN STRIVING FOR A MEASURE OF NATIONAL UNITY . HIS FAIRLY

COMPETENT ARMY OF 50,000 MEN CONTROLS THE MAIN CITIES AND ABOUT 50 PER

CENT OF THE TEXAS-SIZED NATION . ABOUT 35 PER CENT OF THE AREA IS NO

MAN'S LAND, AND THE REMAINING 15 PER CENT IS DIVIDED AMONG A VARIETY OF

INSURGENTS, RANGING FROM TRIBAL GROUPS, SUCH AS THE SHANS, KARENS AND

KACHINS, TO TWO MAJOR BANDS OF COMMUNIST INSURGENTS, 1) THE TROTSKYITE

RED FLAG MOVEMENT, AND 2) THE LARGER WHITE FLAG COMMUNISTS, WHO ARE

FRAGMENTED INTO STALINIST AND REVISIONIST WINGS . STILL ANOTHER

INSURGENT OUTFIT IS COMPOSED OF SEVERAL HUNDRED CHINESE NATIONALIST

SOLDIERS WHO FLED THEIR HOMELAND YEARS AGO AND HAVE SINCE OPERATED AS

BANDITS .

IN VAIN, PREVIOUS BURMESE GOVERNMENTS

HAVE OFFERED AMNESTIES TO THE REBELS . NE WIN WENT FARTHER : HE

PROMISED A SAFE-CONDUCT TO REBEL LEADERS FOR DISCUSSIONS IN RANGOON .

RED FLAG LEADER THAKIN SOE ACCEPTED . HE WAS PICKED UP BY A RIVER

GUNBOAT, TAKEN TO A GOVERNMENT AIRFIELD AND FLOWN TO RANGOON, WHERE HE

PROMPTLY DEMANDED 1) A NATIONWIDE CEASE-FIRE, 2) WITHDRAWAL OF BURMESE

TROOPS FROM VITAL RED FLAG AREAS, AND 3) A MEETING OF ALL POLITICAL

FACTIONS LEGAL AND ILLEGAL TO FORM A NEW GOVERNMENT . TAKEN ABACK BY

THESE DEMANDS, NE WIN DENOUNCED THAKIN SOE AS " INSINCERE " AND GAVE

HIM SEVEN DAYS' IMMUNITY TO GET BACK TO THE SAFETY OF HIS JUNGLE

INDIA THE CASE OF NEHRU'S DOG IN INDIA, CRIED A

SOCIALIST POLITICIAN LAST WEEK, 270 MILLION PEOPLE EXIST ON 4 #$ A DAY,

WHILE IT TAKES 63 #$ DAILY TO FEED JAWAHARLAL NEHRU'S DOG . NOT SO,

RETORTED NEHRU : DAILY SUBSISTENCE FOR 70 PER CENT OF THE POPULATION

IS ALL OF 20 #$ . (HE DID NOT DENY HIS CANINE FOOD COSTS.) THE

ACCUSATION, AND THE PRIME MINISTER'S REPLY, WERE FAIR SAMPLES OF THE

ACRIMONIOUS PERSONAL ATTACK ON NEHRU

LAST WEEK DURING THE FIRST CENSURE MOTION AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT IN

INDIA'S 16 YEARS OF INDEPENDENCE . WITH A 229-SEAT PLURALITY, NEHRU'S

CONGRESS PARTY WAS IN NO DANGER . NEVERTHELESS, THE DEBATE, WHICH

FOLLOWED THREE SHATTERING BY-ELECTION DEFEATS FOR THE GOVERNMENT,

VENTED INDIANS' WIDE AND RISING DISSATISFACTION WITH THE CONGRESS PARTY

POLICIES THAT LED TO THE NATION'S HUMILIATING DEFEATS BY THE CHINESE

LAST OCTOBER . THE ATTACK ON THE GOVERNMENT WAS LED BY J . B .

DOMESTIC

POLICY, " DECLARED KRIPALANI . IT " HAS FAILED IN ITS FOREIGN POLICY,

15 YEARS . " THE GOVERNMENT'S LONGTIME POLICY OF " NONALIGNMENT, "

KRIPALANI ARGUED, NO LONGER FITS " NATIONAL NEEDS . " SAID HE : " YOU

CANNOT COEXIST WITH SOMEONE WHO DOES NOT BELIEVE IN COEXISTENCE . WE

ARE AT WAR WITH CHINA . " THE GOVERNMENT'S CASE WAS NOT NOTABLY HELPED

BY KRISHNA MENON, WHO, IN HIS FIRST MAJOR SPEECH IN PARLIAMENT SINCE HE

WAS SACKED AS DEFENSE MINISTER LAST WINTER, MADE THE CURIOUSLY

UNGUARDED

ADMISSION THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S NONALIGNMENT POLICY WAS BASED,

NOT ON PRINCIPLE, BUT MERELY ON " OUR DESIRE TO KEEP OUR SKINS WHOLE

AND ENTIRE . " THE COMMUNISTS, WHO REFUSED TO ASSOCIATE THEMSELVES WITH

THE NO-CONFIDENCE MOTION BUT MADE THE MOST OF IT ANYWAY, BITTERLY

CONDEMNED THE AIRTRAINING EXERCISES THAT ARE TO BE HELD JOINTLY WITH

REBUTTAL WAS A RAMBLING, SCHOOLMASTERLY HOMILY ON INDIA'S " VISION OF

THE FUTURE " AND THE NEED FOR HARD WORK ; WHILE HE SPOKE, AT LEAST TWO

MEMBERS OF HIS PARTY SLUMBERED IN THEIR SEATS . THE CENSURE MOTION WAS

DEFEATED 346-61, WITH THE COMMUNISTS ABSTAINING . THE HEAT OF THE

ATTACK ON THE ONCE-SACROSANCT NEHRU DISMAYED MANY CONGRESS PARTY

OFFICIALS, AND LED TO THE RESIGNATION OF SIX CABINET MINISTERS, WHO

ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WOULD CONCENTRATE ON REJUVENATING THE PARTY . THE

DEPARTING MINISTERS WERE THE STRONGEST MEN ON NEHRU'S TEAM, ALTHOUGH

SOME WERE IN POLITICAL TROUBLE . AMONG THEM WERE TWO STRONG

PRO-WESTERNERS, FOOD MINISTER PATIL AND FINANCE MINISTER MORARJI DESAI,

WIDELY CRITICIZED FOR FOOD SHORTAGES AND HIGH PRICES, AS WELL AS HOME

COMMUNISTS A FAN OF HENRY FORD'S FROM HIS

OWN CRIMEAN

ESTATE WITH ITS NOW-FAMED BADMINTON COURT AND GLASS-ENCLOSED SWIMMING

POOL, NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV LAST WEEK TRAVELED TO MARSHAL TITO'S WONDERLAND

IN YUGOSLAVIA . FROM A STATE DINNER AT BELGRADE'S WHITE PALACE,

KHRUSHCHEV WENT ON AN ADRIATIC CRUISE ABOARD TITO'S YACHT GALEB

(SEAGULL), SPENT THREE DAYS AT TITO'S ISLAND RETREAT OF BRIONI, THEN TO

TITO'S 400-YEAR-OLD CASTLE IN THE DINARIC ALPS, NEXT TO TITO'S SUMMER

RESIDENCE AT BRDA AND, FINALLY, TO TITO'S CROATIAN HUNTING LODGE AT

BELJE . TO THE CHINESE, WHO HAVE LONG COMPLAINED THAT KHRUSHCHEV HAS

GONE OVER TO THE ENEMY CAMP BOTH IDEOLOGICALLY AND IN HIS PERSONAL

TASTES, ALL THIS MUST HAVE SEEMED INFURIATING PARTICULARLY SINCE HOST

TITO IS THEIR IDEOLOGICAL ARCHENEMY, THE " REVISIONIST " WHO FIRST

BROKE WITH STALIN AND ESTABLISHED A MORE OR LESS INDEPENDENT BRAND OF

MARXISM . AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS QUARREL WITH PEKING, AND WITH A CERTAIN

UNREST AMONG THE SOVIET SATELLITES, KHRUSHCHEV WAS CLEARLY DRAWING

CLOSER TO TITO, EVEN HINTED THAT YUGOSLAVIA MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO

PARTICIPATE IN COMECON, THE CREAKY EASTERN COMMON MARKET . TITO IN TURN

SEEMED DETERMINED TO SUGGEST THAT, EVEN IF MOSCOW ACCEPTS HIM

WHOLEHEARTEDLY AS A COMRADE, HE RETAIN HIS INDEPENDENCE ; IN DOING SO

HE PRESUMABLY HAD AN EYE ON WASHINGTON, WHERE CONGRESS THIS WEEK

CONSIDERS WHETHER TO RESTORE THE PREVIOUSLY CANCELED

MOST-FAVORED-NATION

RATING FOR YUGOSLAV EXPORTS TO THE U.S . CRACKED A YUGOSLAV OFFICIAL :

/ WE DIDN'T SIGN A TREATY WITH KHRUSHCHEV AS YOU AMERICANS DID . WE

DIDN'T EVEN PLAY BADMINTON WITH HIM . " MAMA'S CHILDREN . THE TWO

LEADERS DID JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE, AS THEY RANGED THE COUNTRY FROM

QUAKE-SHATTERED SKOPLJE TO WILD MONTENEGRO, WHERE AFTER A PICNIC THE

MOUNTAINFOLK BROKE INTO THE KOLO, A FIERY, FOOTSTAMPING CIRCLE DANCE .

KHRUSHCHEV AND HIS STOLID WIFE NINA, AND TITO AND HIS STATUESQUE SPOUSE

JOVANKA, BROKE INTO THE RING, LOCKING ARMS AND SWIRLING AROUND WITH THE

PRETTY GIRLS AND PEASANTS . THE MOST INSTRUCTIVE PART OF THE VISIT CAME

AT THE RAKOVICA AUTO PLANT OUTSIDE BELGRADE . IN A DISCUSSION WITH THE

WORKERS, KHRUSHCHEV SEEMED FASCINATED BY THE YUGOSLAV FACTORY SYSTEM OF

DECENTRALIZED, LOCALLY ADMINISTERED SOCIALISM THROUGH WORKERS' COUNCILS

ELECTED BY THE EMPLOYEES AND EMPOWERED TO FIRE OR REVERSE THE DECISIONS

OF THE PLANT MANAGER . THE SYSTEM HAS LONG BEEN DENOUNCED BY RED

CHINESE IDEOLOGUES, AND BY RUSSIA SINCE YUGOSLAVIA WAS KICKED OUT OF

THE COMINTERN IN 1948 . EVEN KHRUSHCHEV ONCE SNEERED, " THE WORKERS'

COUNCILS ARE ONLY GOOD WHEN THEY ARE PROPPED UP BY AMERICAN GRAIN AND

MEAT . " REVERSING HIMSELF, KHRUSHCHEV CALLED THE COUNCILS A /

PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT " AND SAID RUSSIA WAS FACING THE QUESTION OF "

WHETHER OR NOT CONDITIONS ARE RIPE FOR THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF

MANAGEMENT . UNLESS THERE IS A FORCE OF PUBLIC OPINION OUR MANAGERS

TEND TO BECOME AUTOCRATS . OF COURSE, YOUR SYSTEM MAY NOT BE TOTALLY IN

LINE WITH THE LENINIST PRINCIPLE OF UNIFIED LEADERSHIP . DON'T YOU EVER

HAVE TROUBLE BETWEEN WORKERS AND DIRECTORS ? " ASSURED THAT

DISAGREEMENTS WERE ALWAYS WORKED OUT, KHRUSHCHEV SHOOK HIS HEAD

SKEPTICALLY AND SAID, " YOU'RE A LITTLE BOASTFUL BUT, OF COURSE, MAMA

ALWAYS SAYS HER CHILDREN ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL . YOU'VE GOT YOUR

SHORTCOMINGS BUT THEN SO DO WE . " PLASTER BUST . WARMING UP,

KHRUSHCHEV DEMANDED : " WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEM NOW ? IT

IS TO BEAT CAPITALISM . THE ONE WHO CREATES THE MOST THROUGH MASS

PRODUCTION WILL WIN . HENRY FORD HAS SHOWN US HOW TO DO IT . " HE

ADDED, " AFTER THE REVOLUTION, WE SENT A DELEGATION TO HENRY FORD AND

ASKED HIM TO HELP US BUILD A FACTORY THAT WOULD PRODUCE 30,000 CARS A

YEAR . FORD TOLD US THAT A FACTORY MAKING ONLY 30,000 WOULD NOT WORK .

THE CAR WOULD BE TOO EXPENSIVE . HE SAID WE SHOULD COME BACK WHEN WE

WERE READY TO PRODUCE 120,000 A YEAR . " TO ILLUSTRATE THE LESSONS OF

PRODUCTIVITY, KHRUSHCHEV EVEN RAMBLED OFF INTO BIBLICAL HISTORY,

INACCURATELY RECALLING THAT CHRIST HAD FED 40,000 PERSONS WITH A SINGLE

LOAF OF BREAD . WITH HIS USUAL HEAVY-FOOTED HUMOR HE ADDED, " BUT NO

ONE KNOWS IF ALL GOT ENOUGH TO EAT . IF THEY HAD, THEY WOULD NOT HAVE

LEFT PALESTINE . " AS FOR THE CHINESE : " THEY SAY THAT THEIR COUNTRY

HAS TO RELY ON ITS OWN RESOURCES . IT IS TRUE AND IT IS NOT TRUE . IF

YOU LOCK YOURSELF WITHIN YOUR OWN FRONTIERS, YOU LOSE YOUR ECONOMIC

POTENTIAL . THEY SAY THEY ARE GOING TO RELY ON THEIR OWN RESOURCES, AND

THEN THEY WRITE TO US FOR CREDITS . " THE ENTRANCED WORKERS AT RAKOVICA

RESPONDED TO ALL THIS BY HANDING KHRUSHCHEV A PRESENT HE MUST HAVE LONG

WANTED AND NEEDED : A PLASTER BUST OF LENIN . PRESUMABLY NONE OF HENRY

STALINSVILLE ON THE STYX PRIVATE VASILY TERKIN WAS THE ETERNAL SAD

SACHA, AND HIS FICTIONAL MILITARY EXPLOITS POKED SLY FUN AT SOVIET

OFFICERDOM THROUGHOUT WORLD WAR II . RUSSIANS COMPLAINED MIGHTILY WHEN

HIS CREATOR, POET ALEKSANDR TRIFONOVICH TVARDOVSKY, FAILED TO BRING HIM

HOME FROM THE WARS . LAST WEEK, TO THEIR DELIGHT, VASILY WAS BACK WITH

A DIFFERENCE . THE SOLDIER'S RETURN WAS CHRONICLED IN A SUBTLE, STYLISH

NEW POEM BY TVARDOVSKY THAT WAS SPREAD ACROSS TWO PAGES OF IZVESTIA

UNDER A WARMLY APPROVING INTRODUCTION BY EDITOR ALEKSEI ADZHUBEI,

KHRUSHCHEV'S SON-IN-LAW . IN STALIN'S DAY, FOR ALL HIS BUFFOONERY,

TERKIN ULTIMATELY HAD TO SYMBOLIZE " THE IDEAL SOVIET SOLDIER " ; IN

HIS LATEST ADVENTURE, HE IS A COCKILY IRREVERENT FIGURE WHO GETS KILLED

IN BATTLE AND GOES TO A " NETHER WORLD " THAT TURNS OUT TO BE A SORT OF

STALINSVILLE ON THE STYX . HELL, TERKIN FINDS, IS LIKE THE MOSCOW

SUBWAY, " ONLY LOWER . " IT IS RUN BY A PAMPERED ARMY OF BUREAUCRATS,

WHO SPEND THEIR DAYS PLAYING DOMINOES AND YELLING AT THE INMATES TO

KEEP OUT OF THEIR WAY . A MODEL OF COMMUNIST PLANNING, THE NETHER WORLD

HAS MENUS BUT NO FOOD, STEAM BATHS WITHOUT STEAM, HOTELS WITHOUT BEDS .

THERE IS EVEN A MAGAZINE EDITOR WHO " SWEATS ALL OVER " AS HE " PUTS IN

QUOTES AND TAKES THEM OUT AGAIN AND READS EACH PAGE FROM TOP TO BOTTOM

AND FROM BOTTOM TO TOP . " SAYS ONE BIG BROTHERLY GHOST : " YOU DON'T

HAVE TO TALK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO THINK AT ALL . " TERKIN FINALLY MANAGES

TO ESCAPE AND WAKES UP IN A HOSPITAL ON EARTH, WHERE DOCTORS

CONFIDENTLY PREDICT THAT HE WILL LIVE TO BE 100 . THE MORAL OF TERKIN'S

TRIP, TVARDOVSKY SUGGESTS, IS THAT ALL RUSSIANS SHARE THE BLAME FOR

STALIN BECAUSE THEY RESIGNED THEMSELVES TO HIS EXCESSES INSTEAD OF

RESISTING THEM . HOWEVER, THE POET ALSO URGES RUSSIANS TO STOP HARPING

ON STALINISM, WHICH HAS BEEN KHRUSHCHEV'S LINE OF LATE . TERKIN'S

RESURRECTION WAS A SIGN THAT KHRUSHCHEV HAD DECIDED TO SOFTEN A

CAMPAIGN AGAINST CONTROVERSIAL WRITING THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE

DECEMBER . IN FACT, EDITOR ADZHUBEI NOTED

REASSURINGLY, NIKITA LIKED THE POEM AND LAUGHED LOUDLY WHEN IT WAS READ

UNDERGROUND . LAST MONTH POLICE DESCENDED ON THE ARTIST'S SWANK HOME IN

THE JOHANNESBURG SUBURB OF RIVONIA, ARRESTED GOLDREICH, HIS WIFE HAZEL,

FOUR OTHER WHITE MEN, AND A DOZEN NONWHITES .

LIKE GOLDREICH, THE OTHER

ARRESTED WHITES WERE ALSO PROMINENT IN SOUTH AFRICA'S INTELLECTUAL

COMMUNITY : LAWYER ROBERT HEPPLE ; DR . HILLIARD FESTENSTEIN, A NOTED

MEDICAL RESEARCHER ; ENGINEER DENNIS GOLDBERG ; ARCHITECT LIONEL

BERNSTEIN . AMONG THE NONWHITES SEIZED WAS WALTER SISULU, ONE-TIME

SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE BANNED AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS AND ONE OF

THE COUNTRY'S MOST WANTED MEN . GOLDREICH WAS JAILED UNDER A RECENT LAW

BY WHICH POLICE CAN HOLD A SUSPECT FOR 90 DAYS WITHOUT CHARGE . (WHEN

THE 90-DAY TERM COMES TO AN END, SOME PRISONERS ARE BEING DUTIFULLY

RELEASED, ALLOWED TO WALK 100 YARDS, THEN REARRESTED FOR ANOTHER

THREE-MONTH STRETCH.) A MONTH AFTER HIS ARREST, GOLDREICH APPARENTLY

GOT HOLD OF CELLBLOCK KEYS, POSSIBLY WITH INSIDE HELP, AND FREED THREE

FELLOW PRISONERS TWO ANTI-APARTHEID ASIANS, AND A JEWISH LAWYER, HAROLD

WOLPE, LONGTIME DEFENDER OF IMPRISONED LEFTISTS.

DARK MUTTERINGS . THE

CASE CALLED ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT AMONG SOUTH AFRICAN WHITES WHO

OPPOSE VERWOERD'S APARTHEID, PERHAPS THE MOST ZEALOUS ARE JEWS . THE

BULK OF SOUTH AFRICA'S 116,000 JEWS TACITLY CONDONE APARTHEID, THE

JEWISH BOARD OF DEPUTIES HAS ALWAYS BEEN CAREFUL NOT TO ATTACK IT, AND

SOME OF THE WEALTHIEST JEWS CONTRIBUTE TO VERWOERD'S NATIONAL PARTY .

BUT TO THOUSANDS OF OTHERS, ESPECIALLY THE YOUNGER, UNIVERSITY-EDUCATED

GROUP, APARTHEID SMELLS TOO MUCH LIKE NAZISM . IN THE 1961 GENERAL

ELECTION, JEWS VOTED MASSIVELY AGAINST THE NATIONAL PARTY, AND THE LONE

ANTI-APARTHEID CRUSADER IN THE 160-MEMBER ASSEMBLY TODAY IS THE PERT,

IRRESPRESSIBLE JEWISH WIFE OF A JOHANNESBURG PHYSICIAN, MRS . HELEN

SUZMAN . DESPITE SUCH OPPOSITION AND VERWOERD'S OWN PRO-NAZI PAST, JEWS

HAVE SO FAR BEEN UNMOLESTED BY THE REGIME . THE GOLDREICH ESCAPE,

HOWEVER, TOUCHED OFF OMINOUS RUMBLINGS . LAST WEEK WHEN CRIMINAL

INVESTIGATION CHIEF REINIER J . VAN DEN BERGH MENTIONED THE RIVONIA

RAID IN A SPEECH, A VOICE FROM THE AUDIENCE CRIED : " JEWS ! " VAN

DEN BERGH ALLOWED THAT FOES OF APARTHEID MIGHT BE " INSTRUMENTS OF JEWS

ANOTHER FUGITIVE

COLORED PHYSICIAN KENNETH ABRAHAMS, WHO HAD ESCAPED SABOTAGE CHARGES BY

SLIPPING ACROSS THE BORDER TO BECHUANALAND, FOUND HIMSELF BACK IN SOUTH

AFRICA UNDER ARREST . ABRAHAMS' LAWYERS CHARGED LAST WEEK THAT HE HAD

BEEN KIDNAPED BY SOUTH AFRICAN POLICE ON BRITISH-ADMINISTERED SOIL .

NORWAY END OF AN

INSTITUTION INTERRUPTED ONLY BY THE NAZI OCCUPATION, NORWAY'S LABOR

PARTY HAD BEEN IN POWER FOR 28 YEARS, LONGER THAN ANY OTHER DEMOCRATIC

PARTY IN EUROPE . LAST WEEK IT WAS OUT . AT THE ROOT OF ITS DOWNFALL

WAS A LONG-DEVELOPING SCHISM BETWEEN THE PARTY'S MODERATE, PRO-WEST

MAJORITY AND ITS FAR-LEFT FRINGE, WHICH DEMANDS NORWAY'S WITHDRAWAL

FROM NATO.TWO YEARS AGO, SOME LEFTIST LABORITES BOLTED, FORMED A

SPLINTER " SOCIALIST PEOPLE'S PARTY, " AND MANAGED TO WIN TWO

PARLIAMENTARY SEATS ON THE 1961 ELECTION . PARTLY AS A RESULT OF THE

DEFECTION, PREMIER EINAR GERHARDSEN'S GOVERNMENT LOST ITS MAJORITY IN

THE STORTING (PARLIAMENT), FOUND ITSELF DEADLOCKED, 74 SEATS TO 74

SEATS, WITH THE OPPOSITION COALITION . THE BALANCE OF POWER WAS HELD BY

TWO SPLINTER LEFTISTS . RELUCTANTLY, GERHARDSEN ACCEPTED THEIR SUPPORT

TO STAY IN OFFICE . WHAT BROKE UP THE UNEASY COALITION AND BROUGHT ON

NORWAY'S FIRST GOVERNMENT CRISIS IN A GENERATION WAS A TRAGIC SCANDAL

IN THE STATE-RUN COAL MINES . IN RECENT YEARS, FOUR DISASTROUS

EXPLOSIONS AND SEVERAL LESSER ACCIDENTS HAVE PLAGUED THE MINES, AT A

COST OF 74 LIVES . SEVERAL WEEKS AGO, AN INVESTIGATING COMMISSION

CHARGED OFFICIAL NEGLIGENCE . LAST WEEK, AFTER FOUR DAYS OF ANGRY

DEBATE, THE TWO SPLINTER SOCIALISTS JOINED WITH THE OPPOSITION IN A

NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT . ONE OF THE LEFTISTS, FINN

GUSTAVSEN, EXPLAINED THAT THE S.P.P . TOPPLED GERHARDSEN BECAUSE " HE

HAS NO LONGER ANY CONTACT WITH THE WORKING CLASS . " THERE WAS SPITE

INVOLVED, TOO ; GERHARDSEN RECENTLY APPOINTED THAT OLD COMMUNIST

TARGET, EX-U.N . SECRETARY-GENERAL TRYGVE LIE, A STAUNCH LABORITE, TO

THE POST OF MINISTER OF INDUSTRY . AS THE UNCHALLENGED LEADER OF HIS

PARTY FOR TWO DECADES, GERHARDSEN, 66, HAD BECOME A NATIONAL

INSTITUTION, WAS SO SCRUPULOUS THAT HE INSISTED ON BUYING HIS OWN

POSTAGE STAMPS FOR PERSONAL LETTERS . HE RAN A PART-FREE, LARGELY

CONTROLLED ECONOMY, WAS STAUNCHLY PRO-WEST AND LED NORWAY INTO NATO .

HIS SUCCESSOR WAS EXPECTED TO BE BLOND, HUSKY CONSERVATIVE FLOOR LEADER

JOHN LYNG, 58, ATTORNEY AND BRILLIANT PROSECUTOR OF NORWAY'S NAZI WAR

CRIMINALS . CONSERVATIVE LYNG'S FOUR-PARTY COALITION CONSISTS CHIEFLY

OF FARMERS, MERCHANTS AND INDUSTRIALISTS, WHOSE ECONOMIC VIEWS ARE LESS

STATIST THAN THE LABORITES' ; BUT LYNG WILL HARDLY TRY TO ALTER

NORWAY'S DEEPLY INGRAINED WELFARE SOCIETY AND CERTAINLY NOT ITS NATO

POLICIES . WITH THE TWO MAVERICK LEFTISTS STILL HOLDING THE BALANCE OF

POWER, HE KNOWS THAT HE WILL BE LUCKY TO SURVIVE UNTIL THE NEXT

ELECTION IN 1965 .

GREAT BRITAIN BOBBIES IN TROUBLE WHEN CONSTABULARY

DUTY'S TO BE DONE, THE POLICEMAN'S LOT IS NOT A HAPPY ONE . THE PIRATES

OF PENZANCE TO THE U.S . TOURIST DRIVING ON THE RIGHT BUT WRONG SIDE OF

THE ROAD, OR HOPELESSLY DEMANDING A DRINK AT MIDNIGHT, THE LONDON

POLICE SEEM PARAGONS OF PATIENCE . WHETHER BREAKING UP A RACE RIOT OR

GINGERLY PLUCKING ANTI-NUCLEAR SQUATTERS FROM THE PAVEMENT, THE BRAWNY,

PINK-CHEEKED BOBBY ALMOST NEVER RESORTS TO THE PANICKY BRUTALITY OF THE

FRENCH FLIC OR THE OFFICIOUS ZEAL OF THE GERMAN POLIZIST . BRITAIN'S

POLICE, ARMED ONLY WITH A NIGHT STICK, STILL BELIEVE IN POUNDING A BEAT

. ITS STREETS AND PARKS AFTER DARK ARE AMONG THE WORLD'S SAFEST ; AND

WHILE AN ENGLISH HOUSEHOLDER IS AWAY ON VACATION, LIKELY AS NOT THE

BOBBIES WILL KEEP AN EYE ON HIS FRONT DOOR . BUT IN RECENT YEARS, AND

PARTICULARLY SINCE THE PROFUMO-KEELER-WARD SCANDALS, BRITONS HAVE COME

TO SUSPECT THAT THEIR POLICE ARE NOT ONLY MARKEDLY LESS PROFICIENT AT

KEEPING THE QUEEN'S PEACE THAN OF OLD, BUT MAY ALSO HAVE BECOME LESS

SCRUPULOUS IN UPHOLDING THE TRADITIONALLY HIGH STANDARDS OF BRITISH

JUSTICE . SMARTER CROOKS . WHEN IT COMES TO SOLVING CRIME, IT IS STILL

ELEMENTARY TO CALL IN SCOTLAND YARD . LAST WEEK, LED BY SUCH WISE OLD

BLUEBOTTLES AS COMMANDER GEORGE HATHERILL, 65, THE YARD'S DEAN OF

SLEUTHS, WHO SPEAKS EIGHT LANGUAGES AND HAS SOLVED 17 MURDERS, YARD MEN

INVESTIGATING THE GREAT BUCKINGHAMSHIRE TRAIN ROBBERY SUCCEEDED IN

ROUNDING UP NINE SUSPECTS, RECOVERED $761,367 OF THE $7,000,000 LOOT .

ALSO ON HAND WERE ERNEST MILLEN, BOSS OF THE FLYING SQUAD, ALIAS THE

HEAVY MOB, WHOSE 100-ODD SLEUTHS KNOW MORE ABOUT THE UNDERWORLD THAN

DANTE ; AND THE TERRIBLE TWINS, TOP DETECTIVES TOM BUTLER AND PETER

VIBART, WHO HAVE CRACKED MANY A BIG CASE TOGETHER . YET SO FAR AT

LEAST, THE GANG'S RINGLEADERS WERE STILL AT LARGE . EVEN WITHOUT SUCH

HUMILIATIONS AT THE HANDS OF MASTER CROOKS, THE LOT OF BRITAIN'S 76,530

POLICEMEN IS AN INCREASINGLY UNHAPPY ONE . THE NATION'S POLICE FORCES

ARE CRITICALLY UNDERMANNED (AUTHORIZED STRENGTH : 82,313), SADLY

UNDERPAID (SERGEANT'S PAY AVERAGES $3,000 A YEAR) AND, IN MANY CRITICS'

EYES, UNDEREDUCATED . IN RECENT YEARS, POLICE RECRUITS HAVE INCLUDED

NOT A SINGLE UNIVERSITY GRADUATE ; ONLY ABOUT 10 PER CALL NEW BOBBIES

HAVE THE EQUIVALENT OF A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA . BRITISH CRIMINALS, BY

CONTRAST, ARE BECOMING MORE IMAGINATIVE AND TECHNICALLY PROFICIENT

EVERY YEAR . AS FOR SCOTLAND YARD, EVEN ITS STAUNCHEST ADMIRERS ADMIT

THAT THE LEGEND TENDS TO OVERSHADOW PERFORMANCE . OF A RECORD NUMBER OF

CRIMES REPORTED IN LONDON LAST YEAR, FEWER THAN 25 PER CENT WERE SOLVED

; POLICE HAVE RECOVERED NONE OF THE 700,000 STOLEN IN FOUR MAJOR

ROBBERIES FROM ONE BANK DURING THE PAST THREE YEARS .

IN THE WOODSHED . AS FOR THE PROFUMO

CASE, THOUGH AN OFFICIAL INQUIRY INTO ITS SECURITY ASPECTS IS NEARLY

COMPLETE, THE GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN LITTLE ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL LESSEN

WHAT THE ECONOMIST RECENTLY CALLED " THE ALREADY CUMBROUS WEIGHT OF

SUSPICION THAT THERE IS SOMETHING NASTY IN THE WOODSHED . " LAST WEEK

THE LABOR PARTY'S " SHADOW " FOREIGN SECRETARY, PATRICK GORDON WALKER,

CALLED FOR A ROYAL COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE THE ROLES PLAYED

THROUGHOUT BY THE GOVERNMENT, JUDICIARY AND POLICE . AMONG OTHER HINTS

OF NASTINESS IN THE WOODSHED, OR THE POLICE STATION, BRITONS WERE

PERTURBED BY RECENT CHARGES THAT SCOTLAND YARD HAD BROWBEATEN A

CONVICTED PROSTITUTE INTO TESTIFYING AGAINST WARD (SHE LATER RECANTED),

AND BY SPECULATION THAT POLICE DELIBERATELY FAILED TO PRODUCE A DEFENSE

WITNESS AT THE TRIAL OF " LUCKY " GORDON, THE JAMAICAN SINGER WHO WAS

IMPRISONED ON CHARGES OF BEATING CHRISTINE KEELER, AND LATER

MYSTERIOUSLY FREED . SINCE THERE IS NO WATERTIGHT SEPARATION OF

EXECUTIVE, JUDICIAL AND LEGISLATIVE POWERS IN BRITAIN'S UNWRITTEN

CONSTITUTION, THE DISQUIETING IMPLICATION TO MANY BRITONS WAS THAT, IN

ITS EMBARRASSMENT OVER THE PROFUMO SCANDAL, THE GOVERNMENT HAD EXERTED

EXTRAORDINARY PRESSURE TO PUT WARD BEHIND BARS . IF SUCH SUSPICIONS ARE

UNFAIR, THERE WAS LITTLE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY WOULD EVER BE FULLY

INVESTIGATED, LET ALONE REFUTED . DANGER TO DEMOCRACY .E MANY OTHER

LEGACIES OF 19TH CENTURY BRITAIN, THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM SEEMS

ALMOST TO HAVE BEEN DESIGNED NOT TO WORK . TO SOME EXTENT, IT WAS . SIR

ROBERT PEEL, WHO IN 1829 ORGANIZED THE FIRST MODERN FORCE (AND GAVE THE

BOBBIES HIS NAME), ADMITTED TO GRAVE MISGIVINGS THAT IT MIGHT BE USED

AS AN INSTRUMENT OF TYRANNY . UNLIKE A SOLDIER OR CIVIL SERVANT, THE

BRITISH POLICEMAN IS NOT A " SERVANT OF THE CROWN " BUT HAS THE

AMBIGUOUS LEGAL STATUS OF A UNIFORMED CIVILIAN WHO IS MERELY PAID TO DO

WHAT EVERY CITIZEN SHOULD DO ON HIS OWN . EVEN TO THIS DAY, MANY

BRITONS BELIEVE THAT A STRONG, UNIFIED POLICE FORCE COULD LEAD TO A

POLICE STATE . AS A RESULT, THEY HAVE 158 SEPARATE LOCAL FORCES WHOSE

CHIEF CONSTABLES ARE ACCOUNTABLE ONLY TO THEMSELVES . WHEN A ROYAL

COMMISSION IN 1962 RECOMMENDED CONTINUATION OF THIS SYSTEM, COMMISSION

MEMBER A . L . GOODHART AN EMINENT U.S . JURIST WHO WAS THEN MASTER OF

OXFORD'S UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OBJECTED THAT A SINGLE, CENTRALLY

CONTROLLED POLICE NETWORK WOULD BE INFINITELY MORE EFFICIENT, AND MORE

DEMOCRATIC, THAN THE " EMPTY VELVET GLOVE " WITH WHICH BRITAIN IS NOW

TRYING TO DEFEAT ORGANIZED CRIME . " THE DANGER IN A DEMOCRACY, " SAID

HE, " DOES NOT LIE IN A CENTRAL POLICE THAT IS TOO STRONG BUT IN LOCAL

POLICE FORCES THAT ARE TOO WEAK . " IN DAY-TO-DAY POLICE WORK, THE LACK

OF LIAISON BETWEEN FORCES MORE THAN 50 PER CENT HAVE FEWER THAN 350 MEN

INEVITABLY HELPS THE CRIMINAL . ANOTHER BOON TO CAREFUL CROOKS : A LAW

BY WHICH POLICE ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO FILE FINGERPRINTS OF CONVICTED

CRIMINALS, NOT OF SUSPECTS . BUCKINGHAMSHIRE'S CHIEF CONSTABLE,

BRIGADIER JOHN CHENY CHENEY (ETON, SANDHURST, INDIA), DID NOT EVEN

ENLIST SCOTLAND YARD'S HELP IN THE TRAIN ROBBERY UNTIL NEARLY A DAY

LATER . WHAT WORRIES MANY EXPERTS IS THAT SUCH BUILT-IN INEFFICIENCY

CAN ONLY COST BRITAIN'S BOBBIES WHAT REMAINS OF THEIR OLD PRESTIGE . AS

IT IS, THEY ARE FIGHTING THE GREATEST CRIME WAVE IN THE NATION'S

HISTORY WITH INSUFFICIENT MANPOWER AND INADEQUATE COORDINATION, AMID

DEEPENING PUBLIC DISTRUST THAT SUGGESTS THEIR LOT WILL BE UNHAPPIER YET

CABINET MEMBER WHO EARNS $5,600 A YEAR MORE THAN THE PRIME MINISTER,

SOUTH VIET NAM COPING WITH CAPRICORN IN BUSINESS, COUNT THE

COSTS BEFORE YOU ACT . THE MOON NOW IN CAPRICORN SUGGESTS KEEPING

PRACTICAL VALUES IN MIND . TOMORROW IS RATHER TOO ENERGETIC FOR

COMFORT, BUT THAT MAY BE BECAUSE EVERYBODY IS ON THE MOVE . A LATE

AUGUST HOROSCOPE SYNDICATED HOROSCOPES, MANY OF THEM FROM ABROAD, ARE

POPULAR FEATURES IN MANY SOUTH VIETNAMESE NEWSPAPERS, BUT LAST WEEK THE

GOVERNMENT BANNED THEM, PRESUMABLY ON THE THEORY THAT

SOME STAR-MINDED DISSIDENT MIGHT BE MOVED TO TRY A COUP ON AN

ASTROLOGICALLY AUSPICIOUS DAY . IN SOUTH VIET NAM EVERYBODY WAS INDEED

ON THE MOVE, BUT WHERE THEY WERE MOVING WAS NO CLEARER THAN THE ZODIAC

. THE U.S . WAS INCREASINGLY UNHAPPY WITH PRESIDENT NGO DINH DIEM

(CAPRICORN), AND AFTER WHAT THE U.S . OFFICIALLY CALLED HIS " BRUTAL "

CRACKDOWN ON THE BUDDHISTS, WASHINGTON OBVIOUSLY COULD NOT STRING ALONG

WITH HIM AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED . SO THE U.S . MADE NOISES DESIGNED

TO ENCOURAGE OPPOSITION TO DIEM . BUT SOUTH VIET NAM BEING WHAT IT IS,

POTENTIAL REBELS DID NOT WANT TO MOVE WITHOUT VIRTUALLY A WRITTEN

CONTRACT FOR U.S . SUPPORT . MEANWHILE THE U.S . TRIED TO PLACE THE

ODIUM OF THE CRACKDOWN ON DIEM'S BROTHER, NGO DINH NHU (LIBRA), AND

NEW AMBASSADOR HENRY CABOT LODGE (CANCER) MANAGED TO SUGGEST, WITHOUT

SAYING ANYTHING PUBLICLY, THAT HE DID NOT LIKE WHAT WAS GOING ON . THE

SIEGE . A WEEK AFTER THE GOVERNMENT'S CRACKDOWN, SAIGON LOOKED LIKE A

CITY UNDER SIEGE . HEAVILY ARMED SPECIAL FORCES UNITS GUARDED ALL KEY

INSTALLATIONS . MOBILE " ANTI-SUICIDE ? ' SQUADS

PATROLLED THE STREETS, READY TO DOUSE ANY FURTHER BUDDHIST ATTEMPTS AT

SELF-IMMOLATION . AND ANTI-AIRCRAFT BATTERY WAS ROLLED INTO POSITION

OUTSIDE SAIGON'S PRESIDENTIAL PALACE ; SINCE THE COMMUNIST VIET CONG

HAVE NO PLANES, THE GOVERNMENT EVIDENTLY FEARED AN ATTACK FROM ITS OWN

FORCE . HAVING JAILED MOST BUDDHIST LEADERS, THE REGIME MOVED TO

SILENCE OTHER VOCAL OPPOSITION SAIGON'S SEETHING STUDENT POPULATION .

IN THE CITY'S CROWDED MARKETPLACE AND NEAR SAIGON UNIVERSITY,

RIFLE-TOTING COMBAT POLICE IN CAMOUFLAGE UNIFORMS ARRESTED ALL YOUTHS

OF HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE AGE IN SIGHT AND

MME . NHU DOES NOT REVEAL THE DAY OR MONTH

OF HER BIRTH, BUT THERE IS SPECULATION THAT SHE MAY BE ARIES ( " VERY

IMPORTANT TO

WIN THE TEST OF WILLS " ) OR LEO ( " IF

CROSSED, ROARS LIKE A LION, LACKS UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS IN THE MINDS

OF OTHERS " ) . HAULED THEM OFF TO DETENTION

CAMPS ON THE OUTSKIRTS . THROUGHOUT THE CITY, BLUE-UNIFORMED MEMBERS OF

NHU'S REPUBLICAN YOUTH ORGANIZATION MADE DOOR-TO-DOOR CALLS, WARNING

AGAINST PUBLIC CRITICISM OF THE GOVERNMENT ON PAIN OF ARREST . SCHOOLS

WERE CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE, AND SCHEDULED ELECTIONS FOR THE

NORMALLY RUBBER-STAMP, 123-MEMBER NATIONAL ASSEMBLY WERE POSTPONED .

OVER RADIO SAIGON, THICH TINH KHIET, 80, HEAD OF THE GENERAL BUDDHIST

ASSOCIATION, PLEDGED HIS LOYALTY TO THE GOVERNMENT, BUT A NEWSPAPER

PICTURE CLEARED BY INATTENTIVE CENSORS SHOWED THE AGED MONK WITH A

BLACK EYE AND BRUISES ALL OVER HIS FACE . THE GOVERNMENT EXPLAINED THAT

HE HAD FALLEN DOWN . IN OTHER RESPECTS, CENSORSHIP WAS STRINGENT . IN

OUTGOING CABLES FROM NEWSMEN, THE WORD CATHOLIC WAS BLUE-PENCILED ;

AFTER PASSING THE CENSORS, ONE STORY REFERRED TO " ROMAN PRESIDENT NGO

DINH DIEM . " THE GENERALS . AT WEEK'S END MARTIAL LAW WAS GRADUALLY

EASED, AND SOME BUDDHISTS AND STUDENTS WERE FREED . THERE WAS LITTLE

DOUBT THAT NHU WAS IN LARGE MEASURE RESPONSIBLE FOR RUNNING THINGS, BUT

THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS SUPPLANTING HIS BROTHER ; AS FAR AS

COULD BE DETECTED, THE TWO WERE WORKING IN HARMONY . DIRECTLY UNDER

NHU, TWO OFFICERS SEEMED TO BE IN COMMAND : BESPECTACLED, POCKMARKED

COLONEL LE QUANG TUNG, IN CHARGE OF THE SPECIAL FORCES, AND BRIGADIER

GENERAL TON THAT DINH, COMMANDER OF THE III ARMY

CORPS AND MILITARY GOVERNOR OF SAIGON, A DAPPER GRADUATE OF THE U.S .

COMMAND AND GENERAL STAFF SCHOOL AT FORT LEAVENWORTH, WHO WEARS A RED

BERET, CARRIES A SWAGGER STICK, AND LIKES TO BE ACCOMPANIED ON MILITARY

OPERATIONS BY HIS OWN PHOTOGRAPHER . OF SOUTH VIET NAM'S 17 GENERALS,

DINH IS ONE OF TWO WHO ACTUALLY HAVE TROOPS AT THEIR DISPOSAL ; THE

OTHER, BRIGADIER GENERAL NGUYEN KHANH, IS LOCATED IN A FIGHTING AREA

HUNDREDS OF MILES NORTH OF SAIGON . MOST OF THE OTHER GENERALS HAVE

BEEN DEPRIVED OF REAL POWER BY DIEM AND NHU, AND HAVE

BEEN BROUGHT TO SAIGON WHERE THEY CAN BE WATCHED . AT A TIME WHEN THE

ARMY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER IN THE SOUTH VIET NAM SITUATION, THESE

OFFICERS ARE CAREFULLY SCRUTINIZED IN WASHINGTON . AMONG THEM : MAJOR

GENERAL TRAN VAN DON, CHIEF OF THE GENERAL STAFF AND TECHNICALLY IN

CHARGE OF ADMINISTERING THE COUNTRY UNDER MARTIAL LAW . ACTUALLY HE

COMMANDS ONLY A BODYGUARD OF 50 TROOPS, AND AT THE MOMENT IS CONSIDERED

A FIGUREHEAD . BRIGADIER GENERAL TRAN TU OAI, AN ARTICULATE OFFICER

WHOM NHU SIDETRACKED INTO THE POST OF DIRECTOR OF THE MALARIA

ERADICATION PROGRAM . " I'M THE ONLY GENERAL IN THE ARMY, " SAID TRAN,

/ WHO IS ARMED WITH A SPRAY GUN . " HE IS NOW CHIEF OF PSYCHOLOGICAL

WARFARE . MAJOR GENERAL DUONG VAN MINH, A TOUGH, HUSKY TYPE WHOSE MOUTH

IS FILLED WITH GOLD-CAPPED BROKEN TEETH AND WHO IS REGARDED AS ONE OF

THE BEST OFFICERS IN SOUTH VIET NAM . HE IS KNOWN AS " BIG " MINH, TO

DISTINGUISH HIM FROM BRIGADIER GENERAL TRAN VAN MINH, OR " LITTLE "

MINH, NO KIN . HE HAS NO COMMAND AT PRESENT, BUT

SERVES AS DIEM'S " MILITARY ASSISTANT . " BRIGADIER GENERAL PHAM XUAN

CHIEN, ONETIME DIRECTOR OF SECURITY SERVICES, WHO WAS SACKED BY NHU

WHEN HIS AMBITIONS BEGAN TO GET OUT OF HAND . HE NOW HAS THE VIRTUALLY

MEANINGLESS JOB OF ASSISTANT CHIEF OF STAFF . DETERMINED TO DISSOCIATE

ITSELF FROM DIEM'S ANTI-BUDDHIST POLICIES AND TO KEEP THE ARMY ON ITS

SIDE THE U.S . FORMALLY ABSOLVED SOUTH VIET NAM'S MILITARY LEADERS OF

RESPONSIBILITY IN NHU'S SACKING OF THE BUDDHIST TEMPLES . IN AN

UNUSUALLY SHARP STATEMENT, WASHINGTON SAID THAT THE GENERALS WERE " NOT

AWARE OF THE PLANS TO ATTACK THE PAGODAS, MUCH LESS THE BRUTAL MANNER

IN WHICH THEY WERE CARRIED OUT . " SAIGON BITTERLY DENIED THE

WASHINGTON STATEMENT PRODUCED A DOCUMENT SIGNED BY ARMY LEADERS TO THE

EFFECT THAT THEY HAD ASKED THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE THE ACTION

IT DID . " TOP U.S . INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS COUNTERED THAT ARMY

LEADERS HAD BEEN COERCED INTO SIGNING THE DOCUMENT . THE ALTERNATIVE .

IN A COUNTRY WHERE INTRIGUE AND DOUBLE-DEALING ARE ENDEMIC, THE ARMY

OFFICERS ARE FAR FROM UNITED . BUT ONE TOP VIETNAMESE OFFICIAL SECRETLY

IN CONTACT WITH ARMY DISSIDENTS MAINTAINS THAT A COUP CAN AND WILL BE

STAGED, THAT BOTH THE MARINES AND THE AIR FORCE WOULD JOIN IN ANY

UPRISING, AND THAT THERE ARE ENOUGH DISAFFECTED ARMY UNITS IN SAIGON

ITSELF TO NEUTRALIZE TUNG'S SPECIAL FORCES . AT WEEK'S END THERE WERE

MUFFLED REPORTS THAT, MEETING IN TWOS AND THREES, OFFICERS HAD AGREED

ON A LEADER WHO WOULD BE WILLING TO KEEP DIEM AS TITULAR HEAD OF STATE

IF NHU, HIS WIFE, AND BROTHER THUC, ARCHBISHOP OF HUE, WERE ELIMINATED

. NO MATTER HOW REAL THE OPPOSITION TO DIEM, THE DISSIDENTS ARE

OBVIOUSLY AFRAID THAT THE U.S . MIGHT NOT FULLY BACK THEM IN A COUP .

AS A FIRST SIGN OF U.S . SUPPORT, THEY WANT WASHINGTON TO ANNOUNCE

CESSATION OF AID TO THE DIEM REGIME . THIS THE U.S . IS NOT PREPARED TO

DO BECAUSE IT WOULD ONLY SLASH WHATEVER INFLUENCE THE U.S . HAS IN

SOUTH VIET NAM . BESIDES, THE U.S . BELIEVES THAT THE DIEM REGIME CAN

KEEP GOING FOR PERHAPS A YEAR EVEN WITHOUT U.S . AID . IF THE

OPPOSITION SEEMS TO BELIEVE THAT THE U.S . CANNOT BE COUNTED ON, THE

U.S . RECIPROCATES THE FEELING . AS OF LAST WEEK, AT LEAST ONE MAJOR

POLICYMAKER IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT FELT THAT THE SOLUTION WAS NOT TO

TRY TO FORCE OUT DIEM BUT TO FORCE HIM INTO MORE ACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR

POSSIBLY CURBING BROTHER NHU AND TAKING OTHER MEASURES TO REDEEM

HIMSELF WITH THE BUDDHISTS . CRITICS OF THIS POLICY POINT OUT THAT "

CONTROLLING " DIEM HAS BEEN A U.S . AIM FOR YEARS, AND THAT NO ONE HAS

YET MANAGED TO DO IT SUCCESSFULLY ; THEY ALSO BELIEVE THAT DIEM WILL

NEVER REALLY BREAK WITH NHU OR ANY OTHER MEMBER OF HIS FAMILY . IN

THEIR VIEW, DIEM IS NOW HOPELESSLY DISCREDITED, AND THEY URGE A

DIFFERENT CIVILIAN RULER POSSIBLY VICE PRESIDENT NGUYEN NGOE THO, WHO

HAS OPENLY DISAGREED WITH DIEM BACKED BY SOME EFFICIENT OFFICERS . JUST

HOW THIS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED IS ANOTHER QUESTION . THE WAR . AS IF THE

SITUATION IN SAIGON WERE NOT COMPLICATED ENOUGH, FRANCE'S CHARLES DE

GAULLE CHOSE TO ENTER IT WITH AN ORACULAR STATEMENT THAT FRANCE

SYMPATHIZED WITH " THE TRIBULATIONS OF THE VIETNAMESE PEOPLE, " AND

PLEDGED " CORDIAL COOPERATION " WITH " ALL VIET NAM " IN ROOTING OUT "

FOREIGN INFLUENCE . " HE CONVENIENTLY OVERLOOKED THE FACT THAT, HAD IT

NOT BEEN FOR FRANCE'S OWN DISASTROUS DEFEAT IN ITS NINE-YEAR VIETNAMESE

WAR, THE COUNTRY WOULD NOT BE IN ITS PRESENT MESS . APART FROM

DELIBERATELY ANTAGONIZING THE U.S . AT A MOMENT WHEN IT WAS CAUGHT IN

AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT SITUATION, DE GAULLE SOUNDED AS IF HE WERE

TRYING TO ENCOURAGE A UNITED VIET NAM, WITH NORTH AND SOUTH TOGETHER

AGAIN BUT NEUTRALIZED . THE IDEA SEEMED TO BE SUPPORTED BY NONE OTHER

THAN NORTH VIET NAM'S HO CHI MINH, WHO LAST WEEK GLOWINGLY PREDICTED

DIEM'S FALL, BUT HINTED THAT HE MIGHT BE FOLLOWED BY A NEUTRALIZED,

LAOS-TYPE GOVERNMENT . BY CONTRAST, CHINA'S MAO TSE-TUNG, WHO ALSO

COMMENTED ON THE SOUTH VIET NAM SITUATION, SEEMED TO OPPOSE

NEUTRALIZATION, AND PREDICTED THAT DIEM WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY JUST

ANOTHER " U.S . LACKEY . " IN SAIGON, AMBASSADOR LODGE, THOUGH PLAINLY

PLAYING FOR TIME, TOOK HOLD FIRMLY . IN TALKS WITH BOTH DIEM AND NHU

(THE LATTER DESCRIBED AS " HOSTILE " BY INSIDERS), LODGE EXPRESSED THE

U.S.'S SHARP DISAPPROVAL OF THEIR REPRESSIVE POLICIES . POINTEDLY HE

REJECTED THE GOVERNMENT'S DEMAND THAT THE U.S . TURN OVER TWO BUDDHIST

MONKS WHO WERE GIVEN SANCTUARY IN THE U.S . AID MISSION BUILDING .

LODGE'S DETERMINATION NOT TO BE BUFFALOED IMPRESSED TOP EMBASSY AIDES .

/ I'M RUNNING THINGS HERE, AND I INTEND TO RUN THEM WITH A FIRM HAND, "

HE TOLD STAFFERS . " IF WASHINGTON WANTS A WEASEL FOR THIS JOB, IT CAN

FIND SOMEONE ELSE . " LODGE'S FIRST TASK IS TO SEE THAT THE POLITICAL

MANEUVERING DOES NOT AFFECT THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR AGAINST THE

COMMUNIST

VIET CONG . AT LEAST ONE TROOP UNIT HAS BEEN MOVED FROM A FIGHTING ZONE

INTO THE CAPITAL, AND OFFENSIVE MILITARY MISSIONS HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT

DIMINISHED . BUT SO FAR, THE WAR AGAINST THE REDS HASN'T BEEN

RADICALLY HURT BY EVENTS IN SAIGON .

EUROPE THIS WAS THE SUMMER THAT WAS " SUMMER'S LEASE HATH

ALL TOO SHORT A DATE, " SIGHED SHAKESPEARE IN THE 18TH SONNET, BUT AS

FAR AS MOST OF WESTERN EUROPE IS CONCERNED, THE SOONER THE LEASE RUNS

OUT THE BETTER . AFTER ONE OF THE WORST WINTERS IN MEMORY, THIS SUMMER

HAS PROVED A THING OF WIND AND WETNESS, OF A COOL JULY AND AUGUST

SNOWS, OF RECORD RAINS AND BLIGHTED HARVESTS, OF BURGEONING PRICES AND

OTHER IRRITANTS . IF SUCH CRISES OF DAILY LIVING WERE MINOR COMPARED

FLOURISHING EUROPEANS . .BRITAIN . PLAINLY, THE SEASIDE WAS FIT ONLY

FOR THE FISH, AND HOTELKEEPERS REPORTED THAT BOOKINGS WERE OFF 15Q6 .

FOR THE HARDY SOULS WHO WENT, GETTING THERE WAS NO FUN EITHER, SINCE

BRITAIN HAS ONLY 250 MILES OF SUPERHIGHWAYS (COMPARED WITH GERMANY'S

1,870) . SINCE A SWEEPING MOTORWAYS PLAN WAS ADOPTED SEVEN YEARS AGO,

THE BRITISH HAVE BEEN BUILDING ROADS AT MODEL T RATES, AND PLANNERS

PALE AT THE THOUGHT THAT BY 1980 THE CURRENT CAR POPULATION OF

6,000,000 WILL HAVE TREBLED . MOTORISTS GROW PLAE AT A MORE IMMEDIATE

PROSPECT : " TRANSPORT MINISTER ERNEST MARPLES' PLAN TO IMPOSE

PARKING-METER CHARGES OF 35 #$ AN HOUR IN PARTS OF LONDON . PERHAPS

MOST SYMBOLIC OF BRITAIN'S SUMMERTIME COMPLAINTS WAS THE STUTTERING

PROGRESS ON THE RENOVATION OF NO . 10 DOWNING STREET, RESIDENCE OF

BRITISH PRIME MINISTERS SINCE 1735 . A PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSION

PRONOUNCED THE PLACE A " HORROR " IN 1958, PACKED HAROLD MACMILLAN OFF

TO NEARBY ADMIRALTY HOUSE BEFORE THE FLOOR GAVE WAY BENEATH HIM,

ESTIMATED THAT IT WOULD TAKE TWO YEARS AND $1,100,000 TO REPAIR THE

BUILDING . BUT NO END IS IN SIGHT AFTER FIVE YEARS AND $8,500,000 .

DEPARTMENT, A VACATIONER DIED OF EXPOSURE WHEN HE FOOLHARDILY WENT

OF INFLATION . THE LATEST PRICE INCREASES AFFECTED BREAD AND POSTAGE

STAMPS ; SINCE CHARLES DE GAULLE CAME TO POWER IN 1958, THE PRICES OF

250 ESSENTIAL ARTICLES HAVE CLIMBED 25 PER CENT , EXCLUDING RENTS,

WHICH HAVE SOARED 82 PER CENT . PARIS NEWSPAPERS SPOKE OF A " GRAVE

CRISIS, " BUT THE GOVERNMENT PUT OFF A SCHEDULED DISCUSSION OF THE

ECONOMIC SITUATION UNTIL MIDMONTH, WHEN AT LEAST THE WEATHER MAY BE

BETTER . .GERMANY . DESPITE THE ABUNDANCE OF FOUR-LANE, CEMENT-PAVED

AUTOBAHNEN, WHICH ARE BEGINNING TO CRUMBLE AT THE EDGES, 10 MILLION

CARS OWNED BY PROSPERING WEST GERMANS AND COUNTLESS TOURIST AUTOS

CLOGGED THE ROADS IN WHAT DER SPIEGEL CALLED " THE LONGEST TRAFFIC JAM

IN THE HISTORY OF THE OCCIDENT . " ONE TIE-UP STRETCHED 20 MILES,

INVOLVED 4,100 CARS . SOME MOTORISTS HAVE BEEN SEEN DRAWING WATER FROM

NEARBY BROOKS AND WASHING THEIR CARS WHILE WAITING FOR TRAFFIC TO GET

MOVING . WHAT SADDENS SOME GERMANS EVEN MORE THAN THE TRAFFIC IS THE

NEWS THAT MORE THAN 200 OF THE ANCIENT DWELLINGS IN HEIDELBERG'S

ALTSTADT THE " OLD TOWN " WHERE GENERATIONS OF HEIDELBERG STUDENTS

LOVED TO STROLL ARE NEAR COLLAPSE FROM NEGLECT AND FUNGUS ROT . LOATH

TO DESTROY THE ALTSTADT (AND ALONG WITH IT A LUCRATIVE TOURIST TRADE),

HEIDELBERGERS ARE EQUALLY RELUCTANT TO TRY TO RAISE THE $50 MILLION

NEEDED TO RESTORE THE BUILDINGS . .ITALY . SUMMER SKIES WERE SUNNY IN

ITALY, BUT THAT CREATED ITS OWN PROBLEMS . TOURISTS FLEEING FROM THE

FROZEN NORTH CREATED COLOSSAL TRAFFIC JAMS AT THE BRENNER PASS AND

THREE-HOUR TIE-UPS ALONG OTHER ROADS . ITALIANS WHO FLOCKED TO

SARDINIA'S MUCH-BALLYHOOED COSTA ESMERALDA, WHERE THE AGA KHAN IS

BUILDING A RESORT, FOUND THEMSELVES QUARTERED IN HALF-FINISHED HOTELS

WITH NEITHER LIGHTS NOR HOT WATER . AND THE ANNUAL CRUSH OF GERMAN

TOURISTS NEVER QUITE MATERIALIZED . OFFENDED BY A RASH OF ITALIAN-MADE

IRON CURTAIN A COLD WAR FAIRY TALE THE GENTLY, WOODED HILLS

FRAMING THE EAST GERMAN VILLAGE OF MUPPERG ARE IDEAL FOR A SUNDAY

STROLL BUT DISFIGURED BY A FEARSOME SCAR THE 500-YD.-WIDE DEATH STRIP

SEALING OFF EAST FROM WEST . GUARDED BY GREPOS (COMMUNIST BORDER

POLICE) WITH ORDERS TO SHOOT ANYTHING THAT MOVES, THE NO MAN'S LAND IS

SOWN WITH MINES AND FOOT TRAPS, EVERY ONE TIGHTLY LACED WITH THREE ROWS

OF BARBED WIRE . TO BLOND LITTLE PETER EICHHORN, 2F YEARS OLD AND

TODDLING THROUGH THE WOODS BESIDE HIS TWELVE-YEAR-OLD BROTHER, THE COLD

WAR DID NOT EXIST . HE WAS AWARE ONLY OF THE GRASS TICKLING HIS LEGS,

THE FUN-CRUNCH OF DRY LEAVES, THE SCENT OF PINE NEEDLES, THE ZIGZAG

FLIGHT OF A BUTTERFLY . SUDDENLY, DURING AN UNGUARDED MOMENT, PETER

DASHED OFF, BENT ON EXPLORATION AND DISCOVERY . BY THE TIME HIS BROTHER

NOTICED AND BEGAN SEARCHING FOR HIM, THE TINY TOT WAS BEYOND RECALL,

HAPPILY LOST IN THE THICKETS AND FOREST LEADING TO THE DEATH STRIP .

THREE HOURS LATER, ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE EAST-WEST BARRIER, A WEST

GERMAN COUPLE ENJOYING AN AFTERNOON WALK CAME UPON A LITTLE BOY CURLED

UP IN THE GRASS SOUND ASLEEP . HIS FACE WAS DIRTSMUDGED, HE HAD LOST

ONE SHOE, THERE WAS A SCRATCH ON HIS CHEEK BUT OTHERWISE HE SEEMED ALL

RIGHT . THE YOUNGEST EAST GERMAN REFUGEE EVIDENTLY HAD CROSSED THE IRON

CURTAIN WITH THE EASE OF BR'ER RABBIT SKIPPING THROUGH THE BRIAR PATCH,

SOMEHOW MISSING THE MINES AND THE GAZE OF THE GREPOS . WHEN HE WOKE UP,

HE COULD ONLY SAY : " ICH HEISSE PETER (MY NAME IS PETER) . " THAT

NIGHT THE BOY'S FRANTIC FATHER, A SMALL FARMER, TELEPHONED ACROSS THE

BORDER FROM MUPPERG, ASKING IF ANYONE HAD SEEN HIS LOST SON, AND WAS

TOLD THAT THE BOY WOULD BE RETURNED SOON . TAKEN TO AN ORPHANAGE IN

COBURG, THE RUNAWAY HAD A PARTY THROWN IN HIS HONOR, WAS SHOWERED WITH

LOLLIPOPS, BANANAS, TOYS AND CLOTHING RARE LUXURIES FOR AN EAST ZONE

CHILD . TWO DAYS LATER, BUNDLED INTO THE INTERZONAL TRAIN AND STUFFED

WITH GOODIES, PETER WAS RETURNED, PAST EMBARRASSED GREPOS TO HIS

PARENTS AND A COMMUNIST WORLD HE DOESN'T YET UNDERSTAND .

NEW ANTHOLOGY, POEMS FROM BLACK AFRICA (INDIANA UNIVERSITY PRESS ;

ARE SELF-CONSCIOUSLY PRIMITIVE, AND A FEW OF THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING ONES

SOUTH AFRICA BLOCKADE IN THE AIR TWENTY MINUTES FROM NIAMEY,

NIGER, APPROACHING FOR A NIGHT LANDING, THE PILOT OF THE CHARTERED

SOUTH AFRICAN CONSTELLATION RECEIVED AN UNSETTLING MESSAGE FROM THE

CONTROL TOWER : TURN AWAY OR HAVE THE PLANE SEIZED ON THE GROUND .

WITH HIS FUEL TANKS ALMOST EMPTY, THE PILOT HAD TO SET DOWN ANYWAY, AND

THE CONNIE, ITS CREW AND 79 PASSENGERS MOST OF THEM WHITE SOUTH

AFRICANS RETURNING FROM EUROPEAN HOLIDAY WERE SURROUNDED BY BLACK

GUARDS ARMED WITH RUSTY RIFLES . NOT UNTIL 24 HOURS LATER WAS THE

FLIGHT ALLOWED TO RESUME, AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES WARNED THAT IN THE

FUTURE INTRUDING SOUTH AFRICAN PLANES WOULD BE CONFISCATED . AT LAST

MAY'S AFRICAN " SUMMIT CONFERENCE " IN ADDIS ABABA, SOUTH AFRICA'S

NEIGHBORS CALLED FOR AN ECONOMIC BOYCOTT, TO INCLUDE THE BANNING OF

SOUTH AFRICAN AIRCRAFT FROM AIRPORTS AND AIRSPACE . BY LAST WEEK AN

AIR CURTAIN

HAD CLOSED AFRICAN SKIES TO SOUTH AFRICAN AIRWAYS, WHOSE PROUD SYMBOL

IS A WINGED SPRINGBOK, FORCING ITS PLANES INTO A TORTUOUS DETOUR .

UNTIL LAST MONTH, S.A.A.'S BOEING 707 JETS OPERATED TWO EFFICIENT

ROUTES BETWEEN JOHANNESBURG AND EUROPE ONE ALONG AFRICA'S EAST FRINGE,

VIA NAIROBI, KENYA ; THE OTHER ALMOST DUE NORTH VIA BRAZZAVILLE, IN

THE ONCE-FRENCH CONGO . TROUBLE BEGAN WHEN, IMPLEMENTING THE ADDIS

ABABA AGREEMENT, EGYPT, ALGERIA, ETHIOPIA AND SUDAN BARRED SOUTH

AFRICAN AIRCRAFT FROM OVERFLYING THEIR TERRITORIES . S.A.A . REROUTED

ALL ITS FLIGHTS OVER LIBYA . BUT THEN LIBYA ALSO JOINED THE AIR

BLOCKADE . FORTNIGHT AGO S.A.A . INAUGURATED A CAREFULLY PREPARED,

OUT-OF-THE-WAY ALTERNATE ROUTE AROUND WEST AFRICA'S BULGE, VIA

BRAZZAVILLE (WHICH SO FAR HAS NOT JOINED THE BAN), LUANDA, CAPITAL OF

PORTUGUESE ANGOLA, AND LAS PALMAS IN THE SPANISH CANARY ISLANDS (SEE

MAP) . THE " APARTHEID ROUTE " TAKES ABOUT 900 MILES AND TWO HOURS

LONGER TO EUROPE, COSTS AN ESTIMATED $3,000 MORE TO OPERATE EACH WAY,

SO THAT S.A.A . MAY WELL BE HARD PRESSED TO PRESERVE ITS SHARE OF THE

LUCRATIVE EUROPEAN MARKET AS WELL AS LAST YEAR'S HANDSOME $1,500,000

PROFIT . AS USUAL, SOUTH AFRICA'S WHITE REGIME TOOK ITS LATEST

HUMILIATION IN STOLID STRIDE . FOLLOWING AN AGREEMENT QUIETLY SIGNED

LAST MAY WITH PORTUGAL, ITS LIKEMINDED ALLY, SOUTH AFRICA IS PUTTING UP

$5,300,000 TO HELP CONSTRUCT A JET AIRPORT ON THE CAPE VERDE ISLAND OF

SAL AS AN ADDITIONAL REFUELING STOP . SOUTH AFRICAN MINISTER OF

TRANSPORT BEN SCHOEMAN ASSURED EVERYONE THAT THE ISLAND-HOPPING DETOUR

IS EVERY BIT AS SAFE AS THE OLD ROUTES . " WE ARE FLYING AND WILL KEEP

FLYING, " HE VOWED . THE AIRLINE HAS ALREADY LAUNCHED AN ADVERTISING

CAMPAIGN EXTOLLING THE SCENIC CHARMS OF SUCH OFFBEAT PLACES AS LUANDA

AND LAS PALMAS, AND A CAPE TOWN COLUMNIST ELOQUENTLY EXTOLLED THE USES

OF ADVERSITY . " BOYCOTTS HAVE TURNED US INTO SMARTER SALESMEN, " THE

PUNDIT WROTE . " ARMS EMBARGOES HAVE FORCED US TO MAKE OUR OWN WEAPONS,

SELF-GOVERNMENT

TO BORNEO AND SARAWAK . IN A WRANGLE OVER DETAILS WITH THE BRITISH,

INDONESIA FAILED TO SEND OBSERVERS TO THE U.N . MISSION, THUS GIVING

SUKARNO AN EXCUSE TO QUESTION THE U.N . FINDINGS LATER . BUT FACED WITH

BRITISH DETERMINATION TO DEFEND MALAYSIA BY FORCE, IF NECESSARY,

SUKARNO SAID : " IF THE BORNEO PEOPLES AGREE TO JOIN MALAYSIA, WE WILL

DRAW ATTENTION FROM DOMESTIC DIFFICULTIES . IN INDONESIAN BORNEO,

WHICH ADJOINS SARAWAK, SUKARNO HAS SET UP GUERRILLA CAMPS ALONG 200

MILES OF BORDER, AND IS TRAINING 1,000 RED-LINING CHINESE FROM SARAWAK,

FOLLOWING THE GUIDELINES OF INDONESIAN DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL ABDUL

BOOK ON THE SUBJECT . BANDS OF HIS GUERRILLAS PUSHED ACROSS THE BORDER

TO RAID DYAK VILLAGES CLASHED WITH PATROLS OF BRITISH-LED GURKHAS AND

SARAWAK POLICE . IN A FIRE FIGHT TEN MILES INSIDE SARAWAK, THE

INDONESIANS KILLED A BRITISH LIEUTENANT AND WOUNDED SEVERAL GURKHAS

BEFORE BEING ROUTED WITH HEAVY LOSSES . MEANWHILE, BRITISH OFFICERS ARE

STUDYING NASUTION'S BOOK FOR CLUES TO STOP FURTHER INDONESIAN

INCURSIONS . SO FAR, INDONESIAN TERRORIST ATTACKS HAVE ONLY SERVED TO

CREATE A SURGE OF PRO-MALAYSIA FEELING IN BORNEO AND SARAWAK . ALMOST

NIGHTLY, THE INDONESIAN EMBASSY IN NORTH BORNEO IS PLASTERED WITH

SLOGANS READING " TUNKU YES, SUKARNO NO . " ALTHOUGH HIS PEOPLE STOPPED

AMEN ! FOR GENERATIONS

THE WHITE WOMEN'S BURDEN IN STEAMY SOUTHEAST ASIA HAS BEEN SHOULDERED

BY AMAHS, THE SOFTFOOTED, TOUGH-FIBERED MAIDSERVANTS WHO WERE RECRUITED

FROM THE CHINESE MAINLAND . WHILE THE AMAH (LITERALLY, " LITTLE MOTHER

/ ) COOKED, CLEANED AND LOOKED AFTER THE CHILDREN, THE COLONEL'S LADY

OR PLANTER'S WIFE SPENT HER MORNINGS AT TENNIS, HER AFTERNOONS AT

BRIDGE, AND APPEARED FRESHLY STARCHED ON THE VERANDA AT SUNDOWN TO

GREET HER RETURNING HUSBAND WITH COLD STINGERS, HOT CURRY AND ETERNAL

COMPLAINT ABOUT THE HARDSHIPS OF LIFE IN THE TROPICS . IN MALAYA AND

SINGAPORE TODAY, A MEM-SAHIB IS MORE APT TO SPEND HER DAY SCREAMING AT

THE AMAH, DOING THE HOUSEWORK HERSELF, OR ELSE TRYING TO POACH THE

PERFECT GEM WHO WORKS FOR THE ARBUTHNOTS . FOR THE OLD-STYLE AMAHS,

WHOSE WHITE TUNICS, BLACK SILK PAJAMA TROUSERS AND SMOOTHLY BRAIDED

HAIR MADE THEM LOOK LIKE PIGTAILED PENGUINS, BELONG TO A DYING RACE .

SMASHED WEDGWOOD . MOST NEW NATIONS OF SOUTHEAST ASIA HAVE ENOUGH

TROUBLE ALREADY WITH CHINESE MINORITIES AND ARE DEAD-SET AGAINST

BRINGING IN MORE REFUGEES FROM THE MAINLAND . HASTENING THEIR

EXTINCTION IS THE FACT THAT MANY OF THE FINER AMAHS ARE CANTONESE WOMEN

WHO TRADITIONALLY BELONG TO KONGSIS, OR SISTERHOODS, THAT PLEDGE THEM

TO SPINSTERHOOD . AMAHS FROM HAINAN, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE USUALLY

MARRIED . THEIR HUSBANDS USED TO BE ADMIRABLE CRICHTONS OF COLONIAL

SOCIETY, AND THEIR DAUGHTERS IN TIME USED TO FOLLOW MOTHER'S FOOTSTEPS

ACROSS THE GLEAMING FLOORS .

THOUGH WELL-TRAINED AMAHS NOWADAYS EARN UP TO $70 A MONTH A HIGH WAGE

FOR MALAYA THEIR DAUGHTERS MOSTLY PREFER OFFICE AND FACTORY JOBS THAT

GIVE THEM GREATER FREEDOM WITH NO OVERTONES OF COLONIALISM . THEIR

PLACES ARE BEING TAKEN BY A NEW GENERATION OF FLIBBERTIGIBBETS WHOSE

MINDS ARE APT TO BE MORE ON MEN THAN HELPING THE " MEM . " MOSTLY

MALAYAN OR INDIAN GIRLS, WITH A SPRINKLING OF UNTRAINED CHINESE, THEY

ARE PRETTIER AND MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN THEIR FOREBEARS AND, SAY THEIR

MEMS, OFTEN DOWNRIGHT INSOLENT . FOR THEIR PART, THE MAIDS COMPLAIN

BITTERLY THAT THE RAPIDLY EXPANDING MALAYAN MIDDLE CLASS IS EVEN MORE

TYRANNICAL THAN THE BOSSIEST BRITONS . IF FLEDGLING AMAHS HAVE A TALENT

FOR SMASHING THE WEDGWOOD, THE WIVES OF BRITISH SOLDIERS AND

TECHNICIANS, COMING FROM A LAND WHERE SERVANTS HAVE VANISHED FROM ALL

BUT THE STATELIEST HOMES, TEND TO BE EVEN CLUMSIER AT HANDLING THE HELP

. WAILED ONE SUB-LIEUTENANT'S WIFE WHO RECENTLY HIRED HER FIRST MAID :

/ I DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO TREAT HER AS A SERVANT OR A SISTER . " FRINGE

BENEFITS . THE AMAHS' ANSWER IS THAT THEY SHOULD BE TREATED AS CIVIL

SERVANTS . IN MALAYA AN ARMY OF 1,000 AMAHS DONNED SUNDAY-BEST SARONGS,

CHEONGSAMS AND SARIS, PILED INTO A FLEET OF BUSSES AND DROVE INTO KUALA

LUMPUR, THE CAPITAL, WHERE THEY MINCED PRETTILY THROUGH THE WINDING

STREETS WAVING PLACARDS INSCRIBED : WE WANT JUSTICE AND WE ARE NOT

ANIMALS . THE DEMONSTRATION, WHICH LEFT BLIMPS SNORTING AND OLDSTYLE

AMAHS SNEERING, CLIMAXED A COMPLICATED DISPUTE IN WHICH THE AMAHS'

UNION IS CHALLENGING A BRITISH WAR OFFICE DECISION TO ABANDON ITS

PRACTICE OF HIRING AND FIRING ALL THE AMAHS EMPLOYED BY MILITARY

PERSONNEL . SOME 3,000 UNIONIZED AMAHS HAVE ALREADY FORCED THE BRITISH

TO BOOST THEIR PAY AND CUT THEIR WORK TIME FROM 70 TO 48 HOURS WEEKLY .

BY REMAINING GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, THEY HOPE ALSO TO WIN FULL CIVIL

SERVICE STATUS, WITH ITS RICH WELFARE BENEFITS . IN ITS ZEAL, THE UNION

EVEN CABLED LONDON, " RESPECTFULLY " REQUESTING QUEEN ELIZABETH TO

INTERVENE IN THE DISPUTE . AFTER UNSUCCESSFUL TALKS WITH THE MILITARY

AND BRITISH HIGH COMMISSIONER SIR GEOFROY TORY, THE AROUSED AMAHS LAST

WEEK DIRELY THREATENED A WALKOUT . FOR MANY OF THEIR MEMS, NO HELP AT

COMMUNISTS ADVICE FROM THE HOST WINDING UP HIS 15-DAY STATE VISIT

TO YUGOSLAVIA LAST WEEK, NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV FOUND HIMSELF PLAYING AN

UNUSUAL ROLE THAT OF LISTENER . EVIDENTLY HE HOPED TO OFFSET THE

RUSSIAN SPLIT WITH RED CHINA BY GETTING CLOSER TO TITO, WITH WHOM

RELATIONS EVER SINCE 1955 HAVE ALTERNATED BETWEEN FAIRLY WARM AND

FAIRLY CHILLY . KHRUSHCHEV NOT ONLY SWALLOWED TITO'S DETERMINATION TO

MAINTAIN HIS STATUS AS A COMMUNIST " INDEPENDENT, " BUT IN A FOUR-DAY

DELIBERATE CONFERENCE LEAKS, TITO TOLD KHRUSHCHEV THAT RUSSIA MUST PLAY

UP TO THE EMERGING AFRO-ASIAN NATIONS TO HALT INCREASING CHINESE

PENETRATION . ADDED TITO : AS LONG AS CHINA IS NOT A MEMBER OF THE U.N

. (BOTH RUSSIA AND YUGOSLAVIA FAVOR PEKING'S ADMISSION, BUT WITH WANING

ENTHUSIASM), MOSCOW COULD MAKE HEADWAY BY SUPPORTING THE AFRO-ASIAN

DRIVE FOR MEMBERSHIP IN THE U.N . SECURITY AND ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL

COUNCILS . TITO ALSO SAID THAT RUSSIA IS BEING TOO DOCTRINAIRE IN

WRITING OFF AFRO-ASIAN COUNTRIES SUCH AS SYRIA, ALGERIA, EGYPT AND

IRAQ, WHICH HAVE OUTLAWED LOCAL COMMUNIST PARTIES . SINCE MOST OF THE

EMERGING STATES ARE ADOPTING ONE-PARTY SOCIALIST GOVERNMENTS ANYWAY,

SAID TITO, THE SOVIETS SHOULD BACK THEM FOR THE TIME BEING, WORRY ABOUT

PUSHING COMMUNISM LATER . TITO AND KHRUSHCHEV AGREED TO HOLD AN

ANTI-CHINESE COMMUNIST SUMMIT CONFERENCE SOON, BOTH TO CONSOLIDATE

RUSSIA'S POSITION IN THE CONFLICT WITH CHINA AND TO STATE FORMALLY THAT

CHINESE WARMONGERING IS FAR MORE HARMFUL TO WORLD COMMUNISM THAN

YUGOSLAVIA'S " REVISIONISM . " BUT TITO AND HIS GUEST SEEMED TO SHY

AWAY FROM MUCH CLOSER RELATIONS . TITO IGNORED KHRUSHCHEV'S APPARENT

DESIRE TO ADDRESS THE YUGOSLAV PARLIAMENT, AND RUSSIA COLD-SHOULDERED

YUGOSLAVIA'S REQUEST FOR MASSIVE ECONOMIC AID, GRANTED BELGRADE ONLY

OBSERVER STATUS IN COMECON, THE SATELLITES' MORE OR LESS COMMON MARKET

. " DIFFERENCES STILL EXIST BETWEEN US ON PARTY MATTERS, " SAID ONE

YUGOSLAV OFFICIAL . " IF WE PRESS FOR CLOSER CONTACTS, AN OPEN QUARREL

MIGHT DEVELOP . " ON TO CUBA . AT A JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE WITH TITO,

KHRUSHCHEV ANNOUNCED THAT HE IS NOT COMING TO THE U.N . GENERAL

ASSEMBLY IN NEW YORK THIS MONTH BUT IS GOING TO CUBA INSTEAD, ALSO

HINTED THAT HE MIGHT BE AVAILABLE FOR A VISIT TO EGYPT . THEN HE GAVE

THE PRESS A SAMPLE OF HIS FAMOUS EARTHINESS . WHEN A QUESTIONER SOUGHT

TO BRING OUT DISCORD BETWEEN RUSSIA AND YUGOSLAVIA BY ASKING HIM TO

COMPARE LIVING STANDARDS IN THE TWO COUNTRIES (HIGHER IN YUGOSLAVIA),

KHRUSHCHEV GOT ANGRY . " WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO SNIFF A SMELL FROM THE

RECTUM ? " HE SAID . " THIS IS NOT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PART OF THE

BODY . " ANYWAY, KHRUSHCHEV ADDED BLISSFULLY, SOVIET RELATIONS WITH

HIS RED REGIME . TINY ALLIES . NOT TOO LONG AGO, RED CHINA HAD FRIENDS

GALORE . MANY OF THE UNDERDEVELOPED NATIONS OF ASIA, AND COLONIAL

PEOPLES EVERYWHERE, LISTENED ADMIRINGLY TO MAO'S BOASTFUL PLANS OF A

SWIFT TRANSITION FROM POVERTY TO PLENTY . THE LEFT WING IN WESTERN

EUROPE AND THE U.S., DISENCHANTED WITH STALIN'S TERROR, SAW MAO AS A

NEW AND NOBLER ARCHITECT OF A PEOPLES' SOCIALISM . IN THE UNITED

NATIONS, IT SEEMED ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE RAMBUNCTIOUS AFRO-ASIAN

VOTES OVERCAME U.S . RESISTANCE TO THE IDEA OF TAKING CHINA'S SEAT AWAY

FROM THE NATIONALISTS ON FORMOSA AND GIVING IT TO THE COMMUNIST REGIME

. BUT MAO FINDS LITTLE SYMPATHY ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD TODAY . HE HAS

EMBROILED HIS HARD-PRESSED COUNTRY IN SIMULTANEOUS FEUDS WITH THE U.S.,

THE SOVIET UNION AND INDIA, THE THREE MOST POPULOUS NATIONS IN THE

WORLD AFTER HIS OWN . IN FACT, HE HAS PLUNGED CHINA INTO AN ISOLATION

SO COMPLETE THAT HE CAN COUNT AS CERTAIN ALLIES ONLY TINY NORTH KOREA

IN ASIA AND EVEN TINIER ALBANIA IN EUROPE .

IT SEEMS LIKE SHEER

LUNACY FOR MAO TO CHALLENGE THE TWO GREATEST POWERS ON EARTH AT A TIME

WHEN CHINA'S INDUSTRY AND AGRICULTURE ARE STILL STAGGERING FROM THE

DISASTERS OF THE GREAT LEAP FORWARD AND BEFORE HE HAS THE ARMAMENTS TO

ENGAGE IN ANY LARGE-SCALE CONTEST . BUT IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT

MAO MAY HAVE COME TO FEEL THAT THE ONLY WAY TO BREAK CHINA'S ECONOMIC

FETTERS, AND STILL ABIDE BY HIS HARSH IDEOLOGICAL TENETS, LIES IN A

DRAMATIC CHANGE IN THE INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ORDER . TO THAT END HE

HAS EMPHASIZED BOTH RACE AND COLOR IN HIS ATTEMPT TO WIN FRIENDS AND

ALLIANCES . RED CHINA HAS ALWAYS DREAMED OF ONE DAY EMPLOYING

INDONESIA'S OIL, THAILAND'S RICE, EVEN JAPAN'S TECHNOLOGY, AS FUEL FOR

A HUGE ASIAN ALLIANCE THAT COULD SAFELY DEFY THE WEST . AND NOW MAO HAS

BEEN EMPHASIZING COLOR AS A WAY TO ALIGN THE HAVE-NOT NATIONS OF ASIA

AND AFRICA AGAINST THE WEST .

PANDAS & TIGERS . IT WOULD SEEM OBVIOUS THAT MAO

TSE-TUNG HAS ENOUGH TROUBLE AT HOME WITHOUT LOOKING FOR IT ABROAD . THE

GREAT LEAP FORWARD, LAUNCHED WITH SUCH FANFARE IN 1958, WAS INTENDED TO

BRING QUICK SUCCESS IN 1) BUILDING A PURE COMMUNIST STATE, AND 2)

MAKING CHINA OVER INTO A FIRST-CLASS WORLD POWER . INSTEAD, THE LEAP'S

FRENZIED MOBILIZATION OF PEASANTS INTO COMMUNES, THE SETTING UP OF

BACKYARD BLAST FURNACES, AND THE 24-HOUR-A-DAY SPEEDUP IN THE FACTORIES

NEARLY WRECKED THE NATION . TODAY, CHINA'S AGING RED LEADERSHIP

(AVERAGE AGE : 63) KNOWS THAT IT WILL NEVER SEE THE PROMISED LAND, AND

THAT CHINA MUST LABOR ON FOR AT LEAST A QUARTER CENTURY PERHAPS MUCH

LONGER BEFORE ACCOMPLISHING THE SECOND GOAL . WHAT MANNER OF COUNTRY

AND WHAT SORT OF PEOPLE MUST THE COMMUNISTS DEAL WITH IN TRYING TO

ACCOMPLISH THEIR MISSION ? CHINA, OF COURSE, IS ENORMOUS 14 TIMES THE

SIZE OF TEXAS . IT EXTENDS 2,400 MILES FROM THE BANKS OF THE AMUR RIVER

IN TOPMOST MANCHURIA TO THE TROPICAL JUNGLE BORDER WITH VIET NAM, AND

2,500 MILES ACROSS FROM THE INDENTED COAST ON THE CHINA SEA TO THE

KUNLUN MOUNTAINS DEEP IN CENTRAL ASIA . INSIDE THIS VAST DOMAIN LIES

JUST ABOUT EVERY VARIETY OF FLORA AND FAUNA IMAGINABLE, FROM ROLLICKING

PANDAS TO PROWLING TIGERS, FROM THE INVIGORATING GINSENG ROOT TO GROVES

OF THIN NANMU TREES . TO ITS PEOPLE, CHINA SIMPLY MEANS " HERE . "

SINCE THE DAYS OF PREHISTORY, CHINA HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN A WORLD IN

ITSELF, SEPARATED FROM OUTSIDE BARBARIANS BY THE MOST PERFECT OF

PHYSICAL BARRIERS . ON THE EAST AND SOUTH IS THE PACIFIC, THE LARGEST

OF OCEANS . TO THE WEST RISES THE HIGHEST PLATEAU ON EARTH . IN THE

NORTH STRETCH THOUSANDS OF MILES OF DESERT ; AND HERE, TO PREVENT

REPEATED INCURSIONS OF HARD-RIDING NOMADS . CHINESE EMPERORS BUILT THE

1,500-MILE GREAT WALL . REBELLION'S HOME . THOUGH UNITED BY AN ANCIENT

CULTURE, CHINA HAS NEVER BEEN AS MONOLITHIC AS IT LOOKS . AN EASTWEST

LINE DRAWN ACROSS THE COUNTRY BETWEEN THE VALLEYS OF THE YANGTZE AND

YELLOW RIVERS DIVIDES NORTH FROM SOUTH CHINA . NORTH OF THE LINE,

SUMMERS ARE SHORT AND HOT, WINTERS LONG AND BITTERLY COLD, AND THE

PRINCIPAL CROPS ARE WHEAT AND MILLET . THE MEN OF NORTH CHINA ARE OFTEN

AS TALL AS AMERICANS, RELATIVELY PLACID, CEREMONIAL AND SAY THE

SOUTHERNERS SLOW-THINKING . SOUTH OF THE LINE, THE CLIMATE IS HOT AND

HUMID, AND THE PRINCIPAL CROP IS RICE . BROKEN UP INTO VALLEYS AND

SMALL PLAINS BY INNUMERABLE MOUNTAIN RANGES, THE SOUTH IS THE HOME OF

INDIVIDUALISM, ANARCHY AND MYSTICAL INTROSPECTION . THE SHORTSTATURED

SOUTHERNERS SPEAK A MULTITUDE OF DIALECTS, ARE COMMERCIALLY

ENTERPRISING AND PERENNIALLY REBELLIOUS ALMOST EVERY CHINESE REVOLUTION

HAS ORIGINATED IN THE SOUTH . PRACTICALLY ALL CHINESE CITIZENS OF THE

U.S . CAME ORIGINALLY FROM A SMALL SOUTH CHINA AREA NEAR CANTON CALLED

TOISHAN, WHICH IS TODAY, CURIOUSLY ENOUGH, KNOWN IN CHINA AS " THE HOME

OF VOLLEYBALL . /

NATION'S BIRTHPLACE . CHINA'S 22 PROVINCES BAFFLE

FOREIGNERS BECAUSE SO MANY OF THEM SOUND ALIKE (HONAN, HUNAN ;

KIANGSU, KIANGSI NSI, SHENSI) . MOST TYPICAL OF THE NORTHERN PROVINCES

IS PERHAPS HOPEH, WHICH CONTAINS THE CAPITAL CITY OF PEKING . FROM ITS

RUGGED BORDER WITH MANCHURIA, THE PROVINCE RUNS DOWN IN A SHELVING

PLAIN TO THE SHALLOW GULF OF CHIHLI . VERY FEW EMINENT COMMUNISTS COME

FROM HOPEH OR ITS NEIGHBORING PROVINCE OF SHANSI, WHICH IS NOTED FOR

SACRED MOUNTAINS AND SUCH SPECTACULAR CAVE TEMPLES AS YUN KANG, WHERE A

MILE-LONG CLIFF FACE HAS BEEN CHISELED INTO THOUSANDS OF BUDDHIST

IMAGES . SHENSI IS REVERENCED AS THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE CHINESE NATION,

AND WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS FIRST UNIFIED BY THE CH'IN DYNASTY IN 221

B.C., ITS CAPITAL WAS NEAR PRESENT-DAY SIAN . SOUTH CHINA IS A MUCH

LARGER AND MORE VARIED REGION THAN THE NORTH . THE PEOPLE OF KIANGSI

ARE THE SCOTS OF CHINA AND ARE SAID TO BE CLANNISH, STINGY AND

QUARRELSOME . THEY HAVE HAD LONG EXPERIENCE OF COMMUNISM AND,

PRESUMABLY, FEW ILLUSIONS, SINCE THE CHINESE SOVIET REPUBLIC WAS

ESTABLISHED THERE IN 1931 AND HELD OUT AGAINST THE NATIONALISTS UNTIL

1934, WHEN MAO LED WHAT WAS LEFT OF HIS TROOPS ON THE 8,000-MILE LONG

MARCH TO YENAN IN THE NORTH . KIANGSI'S SOUND-ALIKE NEIGHBOR, KIANGSU,

HAD A REPUTATION FOR VOLUPTUOUSNESS AND EASY LIVING . THE KIANGSU CITY

OF SOOCHOW WAS THE SYBARIS OF OLD CHINA, AND PROSTITUTES IN ALL PARTS

OF THE COUNTRY TRIED TO IMITATE THE SOFT SOOCHOW DIALECT WITH ITS

MUSICAL, ROUNDED VOWELS . LAND OF LEADERS . THE FRUIT-RICH PROVINCE OF

SHANTUNG, HOME OF CONFUCIUS AND HIS FELLOW SAGE MENCIUS, IS INHABITED

BY A STURDY PEASANTRY THAT SPEAKS A MANDARIN DIALECT SO HARSH AND

UNMELODIC THAT CHINESE SAY, " BETTER TO QUARREL WITH A MAN FROM SOOCHOW

THAN TO CONVERSE CIVILLY WITH A SHANTUNGESE . " BEAUTIFUL SZECHWAN

BOASTS THAT IT GROWS ENOUGH FOOD TO FEED FIVE PROVINCES, AND IT IS

FILLED WITH TERRACED HILLS, RIVERS, COAL AND VALUABLE MINERALS . ANHWEI

CONTAINS THE SUGAR-LOAF MOUNTAINS AND PINNACLED ROCKS MADE FAMOUS BY

THE MISTY PAINTINGS OF CHINESE ARTISTS . TO THE COMMUNISTS, THE THREE

MOST IMPORTANT PROVINCES ARE THE SOUTHERN STATES OF HUNAN, CHEKIANG AND

KWANGTUNG, WHICH PRODUCED MOST OF TODAY'S RED LEADERS. MAO TSE-TUNG

WAS BORN NEAR THE CAPITAL CITY OF CHANGSHA, AS WAS HIS NO . 2 MAN, LIU

SHAO-CHI . OTHER RED HUNANESE : LABOR BOSS LI LI-SAN, ARMY COMMANDERS

PENG TEH-HUAI AND LO JUNG-HUAN . KWANGTUNG, WITH ITS CAPITAL CITY OF

CANTON, IS THE NERVE CENTER OF SOUTH CHINA . ITS MEN HAVE A REPUTATION

FOR PUGNACITY AND BUSINESS ENTERPRISE, ITS WOMEN FOR SLIM, ALMONDEYED

BEAUTY . WAY OUT WEST . BEYOND CHINA PROPER EXTEND VAST TERRITORIES

THAT WERE CONQUERED CENTURIES AGO BUT OFTEN LIGHTLY HELD BY THE CHINESE

. THE BROAD PLAINS OF MANCHURIA HAVE BECOME THE THREE PROVINCES OF

KIRIN, HEILUNGKIANG, AND LIAONING . SHENYANG, FORMERLY KNOWN AS MUKDEN,

IS THE PITTSBURGH OF CHINA, AND ITS STEEL MILLS ARE WITHIN SIGHT OF THE

FELT-COVERED TENTS OF MANCHU HERDSMEN, WHO ARE NOW OUTNUMBERED ABOUT 30

TO 1 BY CHINESE IMMIGRANTS .

AS WELL AS MOST OF GENERALISSIMO CHIANG KAI-SHEK'S UNSEATED KUOMINTANG

CHIEFS .

AT INNER MONGOLIA BEGINS CHINA'S FAR WEST, WHICH

ALMOST EXACTLY RESEMBLES THAT OF THE U.S . PRAIRIE, DESERT AND TOWERING

MOUNTAINS AND IS INHABITED BY THE CHINESE EQUIVALENT OF AMERICAN

INDIANS, THE UIGHUR, KAZAKH AND KHIRGHIZ TRIBESMEN, WHO ARE DISTINCT IN

RACE AND RELIGION (MOSLEM) FROM THEIR OVERLORDS . THE TRIBESMEN HAVE

REPEATEDLY REBELLED AGAINST ALL CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS AND MAKE NO

EXCEPTION OF THE COMMUNIST REGIME . LEAP'S LOSS . NO ONE CAN SAY WITH

ACCURACY HOW MANY PEOPLE LIVE WITHIN CHINA'S BORDERS . THE COMMUNISTS'

1953 CENSUS SAID 582 MILLION . THE CHINESE NATIONALISTS ARGUE THAT THIS

FIGURE WAS TOO HIGH ; IN FACT, SAYS THE U.S . CENSUS BUREAU, IT WAS

FAR TOO LOW, AND VIRTUALLY ALL WESTERN EXPERTS AGREE . IN ANY CASE, THE

U.S . STATE DEPARTMENT BELIEVES THAT CHINA'S POPULATION IN JUNE OF THIS

YEAR WAS SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF 720 MILLION . THIS LAND AND

THIS PEOPLE HAVE NOW LIVED FOR 14 YEARS UNDER THE RULE OF THE

COMMUNISTS . THE GAINS HAVE BEEN CONVULSIVE : SCHOOLS BUILT AT THE

SAME FRENZIED PACE AS TRACTOR PLANTS ; HOSPITALS RUSHED UP IN

PROVINCES THAT HAD SCARCELY EVEN SEEN A DOCTOR ; ROADS AND RAILWAYS

THROWN OVER GORGES, THROUGH MOUNTAINS AND ACROSS DESERTS . THE PACE WAS

SO FAST AND FRENZIED THAT IT RESULTED IN MISMANAGEMENT AND

ADMINISTRATIVE LUNACY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COMMUNISTS HAVE LOST CHINA

A GOOD FIVE YEARS IN ITS REBUILDING, AND THE NATION IS NOW ESTIMATED TO

BE JUST ABOUT WHERE IT WAS IN 1957 IN INDUSTRY AND CROP PRODUCTION .

EVEN IN 1957, SUPPLIES WERE JUST BARELY SUFFICIENT FOR NEEDS, AND SINCE

THAT TIME, AT LEAST 70 MILLION MORE CHINESE HAVE BEEN BORN AND MUST BE

FED, CLOTHED, HOUSED AND EDUCATED . PEKING HAS DUG INTO ITS SLENDER

CASH RESERVES TO BUY WHEAT FROM ABROAD AT A TOTAL COST OF $782 MILLION

. THE QUARREL WITH RUSSIA HAS BEEN

EQUALLY DAMAGING . WHEN SOVIET ENGINEERS AND

TECHNICIANS WERE ABRUPTLY CALLED HOME IN 1960, THEY NOT ONLY LEFT MANY

CONSTRUCTION JOBS INCOMPLETE BUT ALSO TOOK THEIR BLUEPRINTS WITH THEM .

PEKING FINDS SPARE PARTS FOR SOVIET EQUIPMENT HARD TO GET, AND MUST

CANNIBALIZE SOME MACHINES TO KEEP OTHERS WORKING . MANY FACTORIES ARE

NOW DEVOTED TO MAKING SPARE PARTS INSTEAD OF NEW ITEMS . HEAVY INDUSTRY

HAS HAD TO GIVE WAY TO LIGHT, AND AT LEAST TWO PLANTS FORMERLY MAKING

RAILROAD CARS ARE NOW TURNING OUT RUBBER-TIRED HANDCARTS AND

WHEELBARROWS . IRON MONUMENTS . AGRICULTURE IS CHINA'S JUGULAR VEIN,

AND THE YEAR'S CRITICAL PERIOD IS THE WINTER CROP HARVEST, WHICH TAKES

PLACE IN SPRING AND EARLY SUMMER . CURRENT ESTIMATES ARE THAT THIS

YEAR'S CROP WILL FLUCTUATE AROUND THE 180-185 MILLION TONS OF GRAIN

ACHIEVED LAST YEAR A GOOD BUT NOT A SENSATIONALLY GREAT HARVEST YEAR .

THE COMMUNES OF THE GREAT LEAP EXIST NO LONGER

EXCEPT ON PAPER, AND THE COUNTRYSIDE IS DOTTED WITH RUSTING PILLARS OF

PIG IRON, MELANCHOLY MEMORIALS OF THE BACKYARD FURNACES THAT MAO

THOUGHT WOULD REVITALIZE CHINA . THE TYPICAL FARM UNIT NOW IS A

PRODUCTION TEAM OF 25 TO 40 FAMILIES, WHICH ARE GIVEN CONSIDERABLE

AUTONOMY IN DECIDING WHAT AND WHEN TO PLANT . PRIVATE PLOTS WERE

RETURNED TO THE PEASANTS IN 1961, AND ARE PRODUCING WELL FOR THE FREE

MARKET . AS USUAL, THE COMMUNISTS KEEP CLOSE WATCH : THE STICK COMES

DOWN IN THE FORM OF CLOSE REGULATION OF THE FREE MARKET, AND THE CARROT

IS DANGLED IN THE GUARANTEES OF SLIGHTLY HIGHER PRICES FOR CROPS SOLD

TO THE STATE OVER AND ABOVE THE COMPULSORY DELIVERIES . IN THE PAST AND

IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, EVERY HARVEST BECOMES A TIME OF NATIONAL

BREATH HOLDING . IN A BORDERLINE ECONOMY LIKE THAT OF CHINA, ANY

IMPROVEMENT IS IMMEDIATELY FELT, AND SO IS EVERY DECLINE . DOUBLE

SELVES . BUT WHAT MOST THREATENS THE REGIME IS THE SQUANDERED RESERVES

OF GOOD WILL AMONG MILLIONS OF CHINESE WHO HAD BEEN IMPRESSED BY THE

COMMUNISTS' DISPLAY OF STRENGTH, INCORRUPTIBILITY AND IRON DISCIPLINE .

MORE THAN BY PHYSICAL LABOR, THE CHINESE HAVE BEEN WORN OUT BY MASS

BRAIN-WASHING SESSIONS, PUBLIC-ACCUSATION MEETINGS, COLLECTIVE

CONFESSIONS, AND ENDLESS " STRUGGLE " CONFERENCES IN WHICH RELAYS OF

REDS UPBRAID BACKSLIDERS . AS A RESULT, HARRIED CITIZENS DEVELOP WHAT

ONE EXPERT CALLS " DOUBLE SELVES, AN OUTER, SUPERFICIAL SELF THAT

CONFORMS TO COMMUNIST DEMANDS, AND AN INNER, MORAL SELF THAT REMAINS

HIDDEN . " BUT IN GENERAL, RIGID DISCIPLINE FELL AWAY WITH THE COLLAPSE

OF THE GREAT LEAP, AND FOOD RATIONS WERE INCREASED TO APPEASE A RESTIVE

CITIZENRY . MORE RECENTLY, A NEW CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN INSTITUTED TO STAMP

OUT APATHY . IT IS A MORE SOPHISTICATED PROJECT . THESE DAYS NO ONE

URGES THE CITIZENRY TO COLLECT FLIES IN MATCHBOXES ; THE CRY IS :

FIGHT WASTE, FIGHT CORRUPTION, FIGHT PRIVILEGE . NICE TO MOTHERS . SOME

OF THE TRAPPINGS OF THE NEW PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN ARE WEIRD . IN RECENT

MONTHS, NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES HAVE REJOICED OVER THE BEHAVIOR OF THE

/ GOOD 8TH COMPANY ON NANKING ROAD, " AN ARMY DETACHMENT ON GARRISON

DUTY IN THE HEART OF WICKED SHANGHAI . THESE HEROES HAVE PRESERVED

THEIR COMMUNIST PURITY FOR 14 LONG YEARS IN THE FACE OF INNUMERABLE

TEMPTATIONS BY BOURGEOIS CAPITALIST DEVILS . WHEN " PROFESSIONAL

LOAFERS " TRIED TO BRIBE THEM WITH WADS OF BANKNOTES, THE MONEY WAS

SPURNED ; WHEN " OVERDRESSED WOMEN ACCOSTED THEM ON THE STREET, THE

SOLDIERS ORDERED THEM AWAY . " ONE SOLDIER FOUND A PENNY AND PROMPTLY

TURNED IT OVER TO THE COMPANY'S POLITICAL INSTRUCTOR, WHO EXPLAINED TO

THE OTHERS : " ONE CENT IS ALMOST NOTHING, BUT IF HE HAD KEPT IT, HE

WOULD HAVE A SHADY SPOT IN HIS HEART . /

EVEN MORE EDIFYING IS THE CASE OF 22-YEAR-OLD LEI FENG,

A SQUAD LEADER IN AN ARMY TRANSPORT COMPANY STATIONED IN MANCHURIA . IN

THE BAD OLD DAYS, HIS FATHER WAS BURIED ALIVE BY THE JAPANESE, HIS TWO

BROTHERS STARVED TO DEATH, AND HIS MOTHER HANGED HERSELF AFTER BEING

RAPED BY A LANDLORD . IN THE GOOD NEW DAYS, LEI FENG WAS ALWAYS HELPING

OLD LADIES ACROSS STREETS, BUYING RAILWAY TICKETS FOR MOTHERS WHO HAD

LOST THEIRS, RUSHING OUT TO DO VOLUNTEER WORK ON DIKES AND CANALS, AND

DIGGING WITH HIS FINGERS WHEN HIS SHOVEL BROKE . LEI FENG DIED LAST

YEAR IN AN ACCIDENT BUT, FORTUNATELY FOR THE PROPAGANDISTS, LEFT BEHIND

A 200,000-WORD DIARY FILLED WITH SUCH SENTIMENTS AS " I THINK MY

PURPOSE IN LIFE IS TO WORK FOR A BETTER LIFE FOR OTHERS, " AND, " I AM

ALL FOR THE PARTY, SOCIALISM AND COMMUNISM . " HAILED AS THE IDEAL

COMMUNIST, LEI FENG IS INTENDED TO BE THE MODEL FOR CHINESE YOUTH WHO

HAVE TROUBLE IDENTIFYING WITH THE GRIZZLED VETERANS OF THE LONG MARCH

AND THE CIVIL WAR . IN THE PAST YEAR, AT LEAST 40 BOOKS HAVE BEEN

WRITTEN ABOUT LEI FENG, AND 1,000 STORYTELLERS ROAM THE VILLAGES

ENTHRALLING ILLITERATE PEASANTS WITH HIS EXPLOITS AND HIS LOVE OF MAO .

COLLECTING COUPONS . BUT IF LEI FENG REPRESENTS THE MYTHICAL YOUNG

CHINESE, WHAT IS THE REALITY LIKE .? ONE ANSWER CAME LAST WEEK FROM A

U.S . TURNCOAT, BELGIAN-BORN ALBERT BELHOMME, A FORMER G.I . WHO HAD

DEFECTED TO CHINA AFTER THE KOREAN WAR . AFTER TEN YEARS IN CHINA,

BELHOMME AND TWO OTHER U.S . DEFECTORS, LOWELL SKINNER AND SCOTT RUSH,

BECAME POLITICALLY DISILLUSIONED AND WERE ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY

. BELHOMME SAYS THE AVERAGE WAGE AT THE PAPER FACTORY IN TSINAN WHERE

HE WAS EMPLOYED WAS ABOUT $18 A MONTH . SINGLE WORKERS LIVED IN

DORMITORIES WITH FOUR BUNKS TO A ROOM, FAMILIES IN ONEROOM APARTMENTS

IN BLOCKS OF BRICK FLATS . DURING LUNCH BREAKS AT THE FACTORY, BELHOMME

RECALLS, WORKERS " TALKED MOSTLY ABOUT FOOD, HOW TO GET FOOD, AND

PRICES . " WHEN AN OFFICE WORKER REFERRED TO THE COMMUNIST CADRES AS "

GOLDEN BOYS, " HIS REWARD WAS A TRIP TO A " LABOR-EDUCATION CAMP, " AND

THEN TO JAIL . ON HIS RETURN TO THE FACTORY, HE WAS RE-EMPLOYED, BUT AS

A COMMON LABORER . IN CHINA TODAY, FOOD IS PLENTIFUL IN SOME AREAS,

SCARCE IN OTHERS . SO IT IS WITH ITEMS SUCH AS CLOTH . LAST YEAR, WHEN

THE CLOTH RATION IN CANTON WAS ONLY 1F FEET PER PERSON ANNUALLY, IT WAS

7 FEET IN TSINAN . TO BUY COMMODITIES, WORKERS NEEDED COUPONS AS WELL

AS MONEY : ONE COUPON, PLUS THE NECESSARY CASH PRICE, GOT A SMALL

COOKING POT . EACH CITIZEN ALSO RECEIVED A TICKET FOR TWO BARS OF

TOILET SOAP A YEAR, AND ONE OF LAUNDRY SOAP PER MONTH, AND THERE WERE

RATION CARDS FOR COOKING OIL, FLOUR, SUGAR AND SWEETS . THE MEAT RATION

IN TSINAN IS CURRENTLY THREE OUNCES A MONTH, AND GRAIN IS 37 POUNDS FOR

MEN DOING " MEDIUM-HEAVY " WORK . (MOST TOWNS ALSO HAVE FREE MARKETS,

AT WHICH FOOD IS AVAILABLE OFF RATION AT HIGH PRICES.) SAYS BELHOMME :

/ PEOPLE ARE NOT HUNGRY TODAY, BUT THEY ARE DEFINITELY NOT FULL . /

THE GRIMNESS AND SCARCITY OF LIFE IN CHINA IS

SOMETIMES BRIGHTENED BY EXPLOITS TESTIFYING TO THE INGENUITY AND DOGGED

WORK OF ITS CITIZENS . CANADA'S DR . WILDER PENFIELD, ONE OF THE

WORLD'S TOP NEUROSURGEONS, RETURNED LAST WEEK FROM RED CHINA AND TOLD

OF A UNIVERSITY OF SHANGHAI MEDICAL TEAM THAT BUILT A HEART-LUNG

MACHINE FROM SCRATCH IN 18 MONTHS . WHEN THEY TESTED IT WITH DOGS, THE

ANIMALS DIED OF AIR BUBBLES IN THE HEART . THE CHINESE WENT BACK TO

WORK, GUIDED ONLY BY ARTICLES IN MEDICAL JOURNALS, AND THREE YEARS

LATER CAME UP WITH A FAR BETTER MACHINE WHICH HAS NOW BEEN USED IN 60

SUCCESSFUL OPENHEART SURGICAL CASES . PLANNED BLESSINGS . CHINA'S

FUTURE DEPENDS LARGELY UPON THE PILLARS OF THE PARTY : THE ARMY AND

THE STUDENTS . FROM ALL THREE MUST COME THE SKILLS AND DEDICATION

NEEDED TO DEAL WITH THE STAGGERING PROBLEMS POSED BY OVERPOPULATION AND

UNDERPRODUCTION . AT THE TOP OF THE PYRAMID IS CHAIRMAN MAO TSE-TUNG,

WHOM THE PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES TO BE OMNIPOTENT AND INCAPABLE OF MISTAKES

. THE PEOPLE ARE ENDLESSLY TOLD THAT MAO IS THE SUN, THE LODESTAR, THE

LIVING BUDDHA, AND HE IS SAID TO BE FAR GREATER " THAN THE EMPTY,

HYPOCRITICAL AND NEGATIVE JESUS CHRIST . " PEASANTS ARE TAUGHT TO SING

: THE SUN IS RISING IN THE EAST . CHINA HAS BROUGHT FORTH A MAO

TSETUNG . HE PLANS BLESSINGS FOR THE PEOPLE . AIYAYAO, HE IS THE

PEOPLES' GREAT SAVIOR ! WHATEVER THE PROPAGANDA, MAO HAS WORKED FOR

MORE THAN 30 YEARS WITH THE OTHER SIX MEMBERS OF THE STANDING COMMITTEE

OF THE 19-MAN POLITBURO WITHOUT AN INTERNAL BLOODBATH A RECORD

UNMATCHED BY ANY OTHER MODERN TYRANNY, COMMUNIST OR FASCIST . AMONG

THIS BAND OF BROTHERS, DISSENT IS POSSIBLE YOU MAY LOSE YOUR JOB BUT

NOT YOUR HEAD . ECONOMIC CHIEF CHEN YUN OPPOSED MAO'S GREAT LEAP AND IT

ONLY COST HIM A TEMPORARY FALL FROM POWER . THE OTHER FIVE COMMITTEEMEN

ARE HEIR APPARENT LIU SHAO-CHI (TIME, OCT . 12, 1959), PREMIER CHOU

EN-LAI (TIME, MAY 10, 1954), DEFENSE MINISTER LIN PIAO, VICE PREMIER

TENG HSIAO-PING AND CONGRESS CHAIRMAN CHU TEH . UNHAPPY GENERALS . THE

PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY NOW 2,600,000 STRONG IS BY FAR THE MOST

IMPRESSIVE PRODUCT OF RED CHINA, BUT THERE IS EVIDENCE OF

DISSATISFACTION AT THE TOP AND BOTTOM OF THE ARMY . AMONG THE GENERALS,

THOSE HAVING A GUERRILLA MENTALITY CONFLICT WITH THE PROFESSIONALS, WHO

ARGUE THAT TO OBTAIN THE SUPPLIES NEEDED BY A MODERN ARMY, CHINA MUST

COOPERATE CLOSELY WITH THE SOVIET UNION . DEFENSE MINISTER PENG

TEH-HUAI, LEADING SPOKESMAN FOR THE PROFESSIONALS, WAS DISMISSED FROM

HIS POST IN 1959, BUT REMAINS A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNIST CENTRAL

COMMITTEE . THE SINO-SOVIET SPLIT SERIOUSLY HAMPERS THE AIR FORCE

(3,000 PLANES, HALF OF THEM OLD-FASHIONED MIG-15 FIGHTERS), WHICH HAS

BEEN DEPENDENT ON RUSSIA FOR AIRCRAFT, JET FUEL AND SPARE PARTS . THE

SPLIT WITH MOSCOW DOUBTLESS UPSET MANY HIGH-RANKING OFFICERS, AND LAST

MAY THE PARTY LAUNCHED ONE OF THE BIGGEST OF ITS PERIODIC CLEANSINGS OF

THE ARMED FORCES . NINETEEN NEW ARMY REGULATIONS WERE ANNOUNCED . THEIR

AIM WAS TO " PLACE THE ARMY UNDER ABSOLUTE PARTY LEADERSHIP AND TO

GUARANTEE THAT THE ARMY WILL ADVANCE VICTORIOUSLY IN LINE WITH THE

DIRECTIVES OF PARTY CHAIRMAN MAO TSE-TUNG . /

PEKING POSTERS . RED CHINA'S EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IS BASED

ON PROMOTION OF THE BEST STUDENTS AND WORK FOR THE REST OFTEN AS "

CULTURED PEASANTS " TO RAISE THE INTELLECTUAL LEVEL IN THE VILLAGES .

THESE LUCKLESS STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES HATE THE WHOLE BUSINESS, AND

THE COMMUNIST PRESS IS CAMPAIGNING TO MAKE EX-STUDENTS " GLADLY "

ACCEPT THEIR WORK ASSIGNMENTS . ONE PAPER RECENTLY HEAPED GLORY ON THE

COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO SMIRKED SCARCELY AT ALL WHEN ONE OLD GRAD CAME

BACK TO TAKE A JOB ON THE CAMPUS CLEANING THE TOILETS . THE SCHOOLS

HAVE BECOME A CASUALTY OF THE GREAT LEAP . IN 1961-62 ENROLLMENT WAS

CUT 20 PER CENT , AND THEN CUT ANOTHER 20 PER CENT THE FOLLOWING YEAR .

THIS IS A DANGEROUS BUSINESS, FOR IT WAS STUDENT DISAFFECTION THAT MADE

THE COMMUNISTS' TASK ALL THE EASIER IN THEIR FINAL BIG PUSH AGAINST THE

KUOMINTANG . COMMUNISM'S PROBLEM, AT THIS MOMENT OF INDUSTRIAL

SLOWDOWN, IS THAT THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF TECHNICAL AND MANAGERIAL JOBS,

NOT OF EDUCATED PEOPLE . THE COMMUNIST PARTY HAS VIEWED THE STUDENTS

WITH CONSIDERABLE SUSPICION EVER SINCE THE PERIOD OF THE HUNDRED

FLOWERS, WHEN STUDENT MANIFESTOS AND POSTERS DENOUNCING GOVERNMENT

EXCESSES WERE SLAPPED ON EVERY SPACE AVAILABLE . SOME TATTERED BITS OF

THESE INFLAMMATORY POSTERS STILL CLING TO THE WALLS AND CEILINGS AT

PEKING UNIVERSITY, WHICH HAS AN ENROLLMENT OF 100,000 . AMONG THE

THOUSANDS OF CHINESE REFUGEES POURING INTO HONG KONG IN THE PAST YEAR

AND A HALF THERE HAS BEEN A SMALL TRICKLE OF ENGINEERS AND

INTELLECTUALS, FORMER BELIEVERS WHO ARE NOW DISILLUSIONED . THEY ARE

NOT PARTY MEMBERS, AND THE NUMBER IS NOT LARGE ; THE SIGNIFICANCE LIES

IN THE FACT THAT IT IS THE FIRST TIME SUCH COMMUNIST-EDUCATED

INTELLECTUALS HAVE BEEN FLEEING RED CHINA . SHEAF OF SECRETS . THE

SINO-SOVIET EXCHANGES ARE REACHING SUCH A POINT OF BITTERNESS THAT IN

EARLIER AND SIMPLER TIMES, BOTH NATIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN MOBILIZING

THEIR ARMIES . YET, FOR ALL THE INTEMPERATENESS OF ITS LANGUAGE, PEKING

HAS BEEN NOTABLY CAUTIOUS ABOUT GETTING DEEPLY INVOLVED BEYOND RED

CHINA'S OWN FRONTIERS IN LINE WITH THE RED CHINESE AXIOM, " DESPISE THE

ENEMY STRATEGICALLY, BUT RESPECT HIM TACTICALLY . " THE WEST GOT AN

INSIDE LOOK AT RED CHINA'S PERSPECTIVE ON GREAT-POWER CONFLICTS BACK IN

1961, WHEN U.S . AGENTS OBTAINED POSSESSION OF A 40,000-WORD SHEAF OF

SECRET BULLETINS THAT HAD BEEN ISSUED TO OFFICERS BY THE GENERAL

POLITICAL AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT OF RED CHINA'S ARMY . IN ONE BULLETIN,

LAOS WAS DESCRIBED AS AN IMPERIALIST CORK TO KEEP CHINESE INFLUENCE OUT

OF SOUTHEAST ASIA . WITH TYPICAL SELF-CONCERN, THE CHINESE CALLED LAOS

THE " FOCUS " OF THE " WORLDWIDE ANTI-IMPERIALIST STRUGGLE, " ALTHOUGH,

FOR THE RUSSIANS, BERLIN WAS FAR MORE VITAL . BUT PEKING WELCOMED THE

CEASE-FIRE ORDERED BY THE GENEVA AGREEMENTS . PARTLY, THIS WAS IN LINE

WITH THEIR TRADITIONAL FORMULA OF FIGHT A LITTLE, TALK A LITTLE . THE

CAPTURED DOCUMENTS DISCLOSED THE MILITARY TIE-UP WITH THE 1961 SPRING

OF DESPAIR AT HOME, WHEN RED CHINA FACED INTERNAL UPRISINGS, WIDESPREAD

FOOD SHORTAGES, AND MORALE PROBLEMS IN THE ARMY ITSELF . SOLDIERS

GRUMBLED AT CONDITIONS IN THE VILLAGES, COMPLAINING THAT " AT PRESENT,

WHAT THE FARMERS EAT IS EVEN WORSE THAN WHAT DOGS EAT, " AND CHARGING "

VILLAGE CADRES WITH BEATING AND SCOLDING PEOPLE JUST AS IN THE OLD

SOCIETY . " PEKING WANTED NO ADDITIONAL TROUBLE IN LAOS . WHERE'S THE

BOMB ? ANOTHER REASON FOR CHINESE CAUTION WAS THE GLOOMY CONVICTION

THAT MOSCOW WOULD WITHHOLD HELP . WARNED A COMMUNIST GENERAL, " IF

THERE IS A WAR WITHIN THREE TO FIVE YEARS, WE WILL HAVE TO RELY ON THE

WEAPONS WE NOW HAVE . " TODAY THE WEAPONS CHINA MOST DESPERATELY WANTS

NUCLEAR WARHEADS ARE NOWHERE IN SIGHT . PEKING IS SO BITTER ABOUT

MOSCOW'S RENEGING ON ITS 1957 AGREEMENT TO HELP CREATE A RED CHINESE

ATOM BOMB THAT IT HAS BROADCAST DETAILS OF THE RUSSIAN ABOUT-FACE .

CHINESE PHYSICISTS ARE NOW BELIEVED TO BE TWO TO THREE YEARS AWAY FROM

DETONATING A NUCLEAR BLAST, FARTHER STILL FROM WHAT THE EXPERTS CALL A

/ SIGNIFICANT CAPABILITY . " BUT WORK PROCEEDS ON THE PROJECT, FOR

PEKING HOPES THAT ACHIEVEMENT OF NUCLEAR STATUS, HOWEVER PRIMITIVE,

WILL GAIN PRESTIGE AMONG THE UNDERDEVELOPED MILLIONS ON EARTH WHOSE

RESPECT AND ALLIANCE THE RED CHINESE ARE OUT TO WIN .

THE NOISE FROM PEKING SHOWED NO SIGN OF DIMINISHING AND CONTINUED TO

FASCINATE THE NON-COMMUNIST WORLD WITH FRESH TALES OF OLD SKELETONS IN

COMMUNIST

CLOSETS . IN ONE ANNOUNCEMENT, RED CHINA TOOK FULL CREDIT FOR FORCING A

WEAK-KNEED KHRUSHCHEV ( " WHO HAD DECIDED TO ABANDON SOCIALIST HUNGARY

TO COUNTERREVOLUTION " ) TO SEND RUSSIAN TANKS INTO BUDAPEST AND CRUSH

THE 1956 UPRISING . PEKING RADIO ALSO MADE AN UNPRECEDENTED REFERENCE

TO IMPORTANT FACTIONAL DISPUTES WITHIN THE TOP RANKS OF THE CHINESE

COMMUNIST PARTY . KHRUSHCHEV WAS ACCUSED OF OPENLY VOICING SUPPORT FOR

/ ANTIPARTY ELEMENTS " IN CHINA . WESTERN EXPERTS BELIEVE THE CHINESE "

ELEMENTS " KHRUSHCHEV WAS SUPPORTING WERE MILITARY MEN WHO OPPOSED THE

GROWING SINO-SOVIET SPLIT, MOST LIKELY FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER PENG

TEH-HUAI AND HIS DEPUTY, HUANG KE-CHENG . KHRUSHCHEV IS ADDITIONALLY

CHARGED WITH TRYING TO SELL PEKING ON A " TWO CHINAS " PLAN AS A MEANS

OF SETTLING MAO'S QUARREL WITH GENERALISSIMO CHIANG KAI-SHEK . PEKING

RADIO ALSO CONFIRMED EARLIER REPORTS THAT RUSSIA WAS STIRRING UP THE

KAZAKH TRIBESMEN IN SINKIANG AGAINST THEIR CHINESE MASTERS . ONLY LAST

YEAR, RED CHINA CHARGED, RUSSIA HAD LURED SOME 10,000 KAZAKHS IN

SINKIANG INTO CROSSING THE BORDER INTO SOVIET KAZAKHSTAN . DESPITE

REPEATED PROTEST FROM PEKING, RUSSIA REFUSED TO GIVE BACK THE KAZAKHS

BECAUSE OF " HUMANITARIANISM " A PRETEXT THAT CHINA CLEARLY REGARDED

AS LUDICROUS . WHETHER OR NOT RED CHINA SUCCEEDS IN ITS GREAT DESIGN TO

BE LEADER OF AN AFRO-ASIAN-LATIN AMERICAN ALLIANCE, MAO TSE-TUNG WILL

NOT BE AROUND TO SEE THE RESULT . AT 69, MAO NOW NEEDS HELP IN WALKING

. HE DISAPPEARS FOR LONG STRETCHES, REPORTEDLY TO MEDITATE IN HIS

PAVILION FACING LOVELY WEST LAKE IN HANGCHOW . NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHY

HE GAVE UP THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE GOVERNMENT IN 1958 AFTER ONE TERM IN

OFFICE . PERHAPS IT WAS TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS KEY JOB AS HEAD OF

THE PARTY . OR WAS HE PREPARING AN ORDERLY TRANSITION FOR HIS SUCCESSOR

? SO DEEP IS THE CLEAVAGE BETWEEN CHINA AND THE SOVIET UNION THAT IT

COULD HARDLY BE RESOLVED EXCEPT BY THE DEATH OR DISAPPEARANCE OF EITHER

MAO OR KHRUSHCHEV . BUT, AFTER MAO, WHO ? THE IMMEDIATE SUCCESSOR IS

ALMOST CERTAIN TO BE LIU SHAO-CHI, THE PARTY'S NO . 2 MAN . AFTER THAT,

IT IS ANYONE'S GUESS . COMMENTS A CHINA EXPERT : " FROM THE OUTSIDE,

ONE CAN SEE THE FORCES THAT MUST, OR SHOULD BE, COMING TO GRIPS IN THE

ARENA OF CHINA'S INTERNAL POWER STRUGGLE . BUT WE CAN ONLY SEE THESE

FORCES INTELLECTUALLY AND, I REPEAT, FROM THE OUTSIDE . WE CAN'T

TRANSLATE THEM INTO REAL DEVELOPMENTS OR INDIVIDUALS WITHIN CHINA . "

WAITING IN THE WINGS ARE THE YOUNG AND MIDDLE-AGED PARTY

LEADERS PRAGMATIC TECHNICIANS RATHER THAN FANATIC DOGMATISTS WHO HAVE

BEEN FRUSTRATED DURING THE YEARS OF OLD GUARD RULE . MAO AND THE

VETERANS OF THE LONG MARCH HAVE SUFFERED FEW DEATHS . BUT A SERIES OF

STATE FUNERALS IS OBVIOUSLY AND ACTUARIALLY, IN THE CARDS . CHINA'S

FUTURE, AND THAT OF WORLD COMMUNISM, CLEARLY DEPENDS ON WHICH EMERGENT

CHINESE COMMUNISTS WILL CARRY THE COFFINS .

MIDDLE EAST THE MESS IN YEMEN THE NASTY LITTLE WAR IN

YEMEN, ONE YEAR OLD THIS MONTH, IS DRAGGING ON IN GRAND DISREGARD FOR

THE PEACE-SEEKING EFFORTS OF THE U.N . NEITHER EGYPT NOR SAUDI ARABIA

HAS HONORED ITS PLEDGE, WHICH BOTH MADE EARLIER THIS YEAR UNDER U.S .

MEDIATION PRESSURE, TO DISENGAGE SIMULTANEOUSLY FROM YEMEN . ALTHOUGH

NASSER HAS SENT HOME SIX SHIPLOADS OF TROOPS, HE HAS ROTATED IN FRESH

DETACHMENTS, AND AT LEAST 20,000 EGYPTIAN SOLDIERS ARE STILL IN YEMEN

PROPPING UP THE REPUBLICAN REGIME OF PRESIDENT ABDULLAH SALLAL . ALL

THE WHILE, MONEY AND MUNITIONS FROM THE MONARCHIES OF SAUDI ARABIA AND

JORDAN STILL POUR ACROSS THE 25-MILE-WIDE BUFFER ZONE TO ROYALIST

TRIBESMEN SUPPORTING DETHRONED IMAM MOHAMED EL BADR . SO FAR AS THE

ACTUAL FIGHTING IS CONCERNED, IT IS STILL A STANDOFF, WITH THE

REPUBLICANS CONTROLLING THE CITIES AND THE PLAINS, AND THE ROYALISTS

HOLED UP IN AND DEFENDING KEY STRONG POINTS IN THE CENTRAL MOUNTAINS .

SHORT RATIONS . IT IS ALL VERY FRUSTRATING FOR THE 200-MAN U.N . TEAM,

WHICH WAS RUSHED TO THE SCENE FROM THE GAZA STRIP TWO MONTHS AGO IN AN

EFFORT TO STOP THE SHOOTING . THE UNIT, MADE UP MOSTLY OF YUGOSLAV

SOLDIERS AND CANADIAN AIRMEN, WAS FAR TOO SMALL TO POLICE THE VAST,

EMPTY YEMEN FRONTIER, AND FROM THE START IT WAS PLAGUED BY BAD BREAKS

AND HOSTILITY FROM LOCAL AUTHORITIES . THE TEAM'S FIRST COMMANDER,

SWEDISH MAJOR GENERAL CARL VON HORN, HAD HARDLY SET UP HEADQUARTERS IN

THE MUDWALLED CAPITAL OF SAN " A WHEN HIS HORSE, BEING LED DOWN A DUSTY

STREET, KICKED A YEMENI GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, RESULTING IN THE ARREST OF

BOTH GROOM AND HORSE . U.N . PLANES ARE REGULARLY FIRED ON (NONE HAS

BEEN DOWNED SO FAR), AND LAST MONTH A RUSSIAN-MADE EGYPTIAN ILYUSHIN

JET BOMBER ATTACKING NAJRAN INSIDE SAUDI ARABIA NEARLY SCORED A

DIRECT HIT ON A U.N . PLATOON . GETTING INTO THE ACT, THE RUSSIANS HAVE

SENT IN AT LEAST 900 WORKMEN AND TECHNICIANS, WHO ARE CONSTRUCTING A

NEW JET AIRPORT NORTH OF SAN " A . RECENTLY, THE RUSSIANS THREW AN

INQUIRING U.N . INSPECTOR OFF THE PREMISES WHEN HE APPROACHED THE

AIRPORT TO CONDUCT A ROUTINE INSPECTION . APART FROM SUCH HARASSMENT,

THE U.N . TEAMS FOUND IT DOWNRIGHT DANGEROUS TO TRAVEL AROUND THE

COUNTRY . ALL IN ALL, ADMITTED U.N . SECRETARY-GENERAL U THANT, IN

EFFECT, THE U.N.SANCTIONED PROJECT HAS BEEN A FLOP . AND FOR HIM IT HAS

BEEN A RATHER MESSY FLOP, FOR IN THE PAST THREE WEEKS HE AND VON HORN

HAVE HAD AN UGLY EXCHANGE OF RECRIMINATIONS . THE PRESTIGIOUS BUT

STORMY VON HORN, FIRST U.N . CHIEF IN THE CONGO AND FOR FIVE YEARS HEAD

OF THE U.N.'S PALESTINE PEACE-KEEPING FORCE, SUDDENLY RESIGNED IN A

CABLE TO THANT, CHARGING LACK OF SUFFICIENT LOGISTIC SUPPORT, AIRCRAFT

AND EVEN RATIONS . THANT BRANDED VON HORN'S CHARGES " IRRESPONSIBLE AND

RECKLESS, " ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK

THAT THE MISSION WOULD CONTINUE, THANKS TO " ORAL

ASSURANCES " BY EGYPT AND SAUDI ARABIA THAT THEY WOULD CONTINUE

SPLITTING THE BILL ($200,000 PER MONTH) FOR ANOTHER TWO MONTHS . SICK

REBEL . ONE VICTIM OF THE YEMEN CONFLICT IS THE MAN WHO STARTED IT ALL

BY OVERTHROWING THE IMAM : EX-PALACE GUARD, NOW PRESIDENT AND FIELD

MARSHAL, ABDULLAH SALLAL, 42 . LAST MONTH SALLAL FLEW TO CAIRO FOR

TALKS WITH NASSER, BUT ENTERED A HOSPITAL AND WAS DISCHARGED FOR

CONVALESCENCE ONLY LAST WEEK . A PHYSICIAN WHO HELPED TREAT SALLAL

CONFIDED THAT HE WAS SUFFERING FROM A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN . " PRESIDENT

NASSER VISITED HIM ONCE BRIEFLY . WE GAVE HIM TRANQUILIZERS . WE

BROUGHT IN EGYPT'S GREATEST COMEDIAN, ISMAYEN YESSIN, TO RAISE HIS

SPIRITS . WE SHOWED HIM MOVIES . WE FLEW IN HIS WIFE FROM YEMEN, " THE

DOCTOR RELATED, BUT ADDED SADLY : " HIS SICKNESS IS REALLY POLITICAL .

IF WE COULD GIVE HIM GOOD NEWS ABOUT YEMEN, HE WOULD RECOVER . "

HUNGARY " HUMANIZING " COMMUNISM AFTER THE REVOLUTIONS OF 1848

SWEPT THE CONTINENT, HUNGARIAN PATRIOT LAJOS KOSSUTH SAID THAT HIS

COUNTRYMEN WERE THE " REDDEST REPUBLICANS IN EUROPE . " TODAY, SEVEN

YEARS AFTER RUSSIAN TANKS CRUSHED THE HUNGARIAN REVOLT, HUNGARY'S 14

MILLION PEOPLE ARE FAST BECOMING EUROPE'S MOST REPUBLICAN REDS .

WESTERN INFLUENCES POP UP EVERYWHERE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY . DESPITE A

SCARCITY OF EGGS AND MEAT, STORE WINDOWS DISPLAY ELIZABETH ARDEN

COSMETICS, NAPOLEON BRANDY AND A SELECTION OF SCOTCH . MODERN ART HANGS

ON GALLERY WALLS, AND NEWSPAPER CENSORSHIP HAS BEEN RELAXED ; WHEN

PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S SISTERS, PAT LAWFORD AND JEAN SMITH, VISITED

BUDAPEST, TELEVISION AND RADIO CREWS DOGGED THEIR FOOTSTEPS .

RESTRICTIONS AGAINST TRAVEL TO THE WEST HAVE BEEN EASED ; LONG LINES

OF VISA APPLICANTS DAILY QUEUE UP OUTSIDE WESTERN EMBASSIES IN

BUDAPEST, AND IT IS NOW CHIC FOR VACATIONING HUNGARIAN COUPLES TO AGREE

TO MEET IN VENICE . HUNGARY'S NEW LOOK IS LARGELY THE RESULT OF EFFORTS

BY PREMIER JANOS KADAR TO WIPE OUT THE STAIN OF HAVING PERSONALLY

CALLED IN RUSSIAN TROOPS AND TANKS TO SUPPRESS THE 1956 REVOLUTION .

HAVING FOUND THAT A LIGHTER YOKE YIELDS GREATER ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AND

LESS POLITICAL UNREST, KADAR HAS MADE HUNGARY NEXT TO POLAND THE MOST

LIBERAL OF THE SATELLITE REGIMES . THAT, OF COURSE, IS STILL VERY MUCH

A RELATIVE MATTER, BUT HUNGARIANS ARE GRATEFUL FOR SMALL FAVORS . "

TIMES CAN NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN, " SAYS ONE . " THE REVOLT WAS NOT IN

VAIN . " SUBTLE REVISION.KADAR'S NEW STANCE HAS HAD A FAVORABLE EFFECT

AT THE U.N., WHICH SINCE 1956 HAS REFUSED TO APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE THE

CREDENTIALS OF KADAR'S U.N . DELEGATES (THOUGH THEY ACTUALLY TAKE PART

IN DEBATES AND VOTE) . THE FINAL TRACE OF U.N . DISAPPROVAL DISAPPEARED

RECENTLY WHEN SECRETARY-GENERAL U THANT SPENT THREE DAYS IN HUNGARY AND

SEVEN HOURS WITH KADAR HIMSELF . EVEN THE U.S., UNABLE TO ROUND UP

CONTINUED SUPPORT TO BLOCK HUNGARIAN ACCREDITATION, WILL NOT OPPOSE THE

OFFICIAL SEATING OF HUNGARY'S DELEGATION AT THE NEXT GENERAL ASSEMBLY

SESSION . AIMING TO " HUMANIZE COMMUNISM, " KADAR HAS SACKED STALINIST

POLITICAL HACKS, APPOINTED NON-COMMUNISTS TO CABINET POSTS, AND ALLOWED

NONPARTY MEMBERS TO SERVE IN THE PARLIAMENT . HE HAS GRANTED AMNESTY TO

THOUSANDS OF POLITICAL PRISONERS AND ENCOURAGED REFUGEES WHO FLED IN

1956 TO RETURN WITH FREE PARDONS ; TODAY THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS THAT

MORE THAN ONE-THIRD OF 1956'S 200,000 REFUGEES HAVE COME BACK HOME .

WORKER MEMBERSHIP IN THE COMMUNIST PARTY IS NOT A SURE GUARANTEE OF

SUCCESS . " WE ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE RED BLOODS THE SAME PRIVILEGE ONCE

ENJOYED BY BLUEBLOODS, " SAYS KADAR . TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS ON U.S .

DIPLOMATS IN BUDAPEST HAVE BEEN LIFTED, ENABLING THEM TO GO ANYWHERE IN

THE COUNTRY EXCEPT TO MILITARY ZONES . DELICATE NEGOTIATIONS ARE BEING

CARRIED ON WITH THE VATICAN OVER THE FUTURE OF JOSEF CARDINAL

MINDSZENTY, WHO IS STILL IN ASYLUM AT THE U.S . LEGATION AND WHOM THE

GOVERNMENT WANTS TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY . FIRST SIGNS OF A RAPPORT WITH

ROME APPEARED WHEN THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD APPROVE POPE

PAUL'S ASSIGNMENT OF SIX NEW CATHOLIC BISHOPS TO VACANT HUNGARIAN SEES

. BUT THE GOVERNMENT STILL REFUSES TO LET OTHER BISHOPS AND SOME 1,000

PRIESTS PERFORM THEIR DUTIES . OFF TO BELGRADE . MORE THAN 90 PER CENT

OF HUNGARIAN AGRICULTURE HAS BEEN COLLECTIVIZED, BUT FARMERS CAN USE

STATE MACHINERY TO CULTIVATE THEIR OWN TINY PLOTS . INCREASINGLY, THE

GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO CHANNEL A LARGER PART OF THE ECONOMY INTO THE

PRODUCTION OF CONSUMER GOODS . TODAY SOME HUNGARIAN GYPSIES ACTUALLY

HAVE TV SETS THOUGH THEY OFTEN GO AROUND BAREFOOT . HUNGARY, OF COURSE,

IS STILL A TOTALITARIAN STATE . WATCHTOWERS, MINEFIELDS AND BARBED-WIRE

SEAL OFF THE COUNTRY FROM THE WEST . THOUGH THE MIDNIGHT KNOCK BY THE

SECRET POLICE IS ALMOST A THING OF THE PAST, MORE THAN 40,000 RUSSIAN

TROOPS AND THE HIDEOUS MEMORY OF 1956 STILL REMAIN . KADAR STEADFASTLY

FOLLOWS EVERY NEW TWIST OF KREMLIN POLICY . NO SOONER HAD NIKITA

KHRUSHCHEV LEFT YUGOSLAVIA AFTER MAKING HIS PEACE WITH MARSHAL TITO

THAN KADAR MADE PLANS TO VISIT BELGRADE THIS WEEK, SEEKING TO

STRENGTHEN HUNGARY'S ECONOMIC, DIPLOMATIC AND CULTURAL TIES WITH THE

ONETIME " REVISIONIST " BAD BOY OF THE SATELLITES . NEVER IN HUNGARY .

BUT KADAR'S LIBERALIZATION DOES PERMIT HUNGARIANS TO LAUGH AT

THEMSELVES AND AT THEIR REGIME AS LONG AS COMMUNIST IDEOLOGY ITSELF IS

NOT ATTACKED . IN THE LATEST ISSUE OF THE HUNGARIAN SATIRICAL WEEKLY

LUDAS MATYI, THE EDITORS REFLECT ON BRITAIN'S RECENT $7,000,000 MAIL

TRAIN ROBBERY AND CONCLUDE THAT IT COULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED IN HUNGARY

. " WE LACK ALL THE REQUIREMENTS FOR IT, " SAID THE MAGAZINE . " FIRST,

OF THE 30 MEN IN THE GANG, AT LEAST FOUR WOULD HAVE BEEN OUT SICK,

EIGHT WOULD HAVE GONE BY MISTAKE TO ANOTHER RAILWAY EMBANKMENT, AND

THREE WOULD HAVE TELEGRAPHED FROM LAKE BALATON THAT THEY COULD NOT COME

FOR TWO DAYS . IT WOULD ALSO NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE TO COVER THE GREEN

TRACK SIGNAL BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE A COVER SHORTAGE . IN ADDITION, A

MAIL TRAIN HERE WOULD HAVE BEEN TWO HOURS LATE . THE BANDITS LOADED THE

MONEY THEY STOLE IN A TRUCK . THEY COULD DO THAT IN ENGLAND, BUT HERE,

WHERE THE TRUCK SERVICE STATIONS ARE THREE MONTHS BEHIND IN THEIR WORK,

WHAT COULD THEY HAVE LOADED THE BAGS ON ? /

PAKISTAN WHOSE ALLY ? AS U.S . UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE GEORGE

BALL FLEW IN TO RAWALPINDI LAST WEEK TO EXPRESS CHAGRIN OVER PAKISTAN'S

BUDDING FRIENDSHIP WITH RED CHINA, HE GOT A QUICK AND BITTER TASTE OF

THE NATION'S NEW MOOD . NO FEWER THAN FIVE CHINESE COMMUNIST

DELEGATIONS INCLUDING POETS, PINGPONG PLAYERS AND TRADE OFFICIALS WERE

GETTING THE WELCOME TREATMENT FROM PAKISTANI OFFICIALS . GLEEFULLY, THE

PAKISTAN PRESS TRUMPETED THE WORDS OF ONE VISITING CHINESE BARD WHO

WROTE : " YOU ARE ON THE WESTERN COAST OF THE SEA AND WE ARE ON THE

EAST . THE TIDAL WAVES OF THE OCEAN ROAR, AND INTERMINGLED, WE CAN HEAR

THE SOUND OF OUR HEARTBEAT . " AMID THIS HEADY STUFF, BALL PASSED THE

WORD TO PAKISTAN'S PRESIDENT MOHAMMED AYUB KHAN THAT THE U.S . HOPED

PAKISTAN WOULD NOT CARRY ITS PALSY-WALSY CAMPAIGN WITH RED CHINA TOO

FAR . BUT ALL AYUB AND THE OTHER PAKISTANIS WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WAS

THEIR PREOCCUPATION WITH INCREASED MILITARY AID TO INDIA, WHICH THEY

CONSIDER A BETRAYAL BY THE U.S THREAT TO PAKISTAN'S SECURITY . BEHIND

PAKISTAN'S NEW STANCE IS GROWING PRESSURE ON AYUB BY NEUTRALIST

PAKISTANI POLITICIANS SUCH AS 35-YEAR-OLD FOREIGN MINISTER ZULFIKAR ALI

BHUTTO . EMERGING FROM SESSIONS WITH AYUB AND BHUTTO, BALL DECLARED

THAT " WE HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF EACH OTHER'S POINT OF VIEW . "

IT WAS DIPLOMATESE FOR A STUBBORN DEADLOCK ALTHOUGH AYUB PRIVATELY

HAD MADE

IT CLEAR THAT HE WILL NOT SIGN ANY MILITARY PACTS WITH CHINA AND WANTS

TO REMAIN AN ALLY OF THE WEST, HE PASSED ALONG WORD TO HIS AMERICAN

GUEST THAT PAKISTAN IS NOT ABOUT TO BACK DOWN ON THE NEW AIR AGREEMENT

IT HAD JUST SIGNED WITH CHINA . PAKISTAN UNDERSCORED ITS ATTITUDE

TOWARD PEKING BY ANNOUNCING AN AGREEMENT TO SURVEY THE BORDER BETWEEN

CHINA'S SINKIANG REGION AND THE PAKISTANI-CONTROLLED PORTION OF KASHMIR

CONGO BRIDGING THE PAST PRINCIPAL ARTERY OF COMMERCE IN THE

CONGO WAS TRADITIONALLY THE CONGOLESE NATIONAL ROUTE, A 1,725-MILE

RAIL-RIVERRAIL CONNECTION FROM ELISABETHVILLE IN KATANGA TO THE

ATLANTIC GATEWAY AT MATADI . BUT THE ROUTE BECAME UNUSABLE WITH THE

OUTBREAK OF CIVIL WAR . WHENEVER KATANGA'S SECESSIONIST MOISE TSHOMBE

FELT EVENTS GOING AGAINST HIM, HE QUICKLY ORDERED ANOTHER RAILROAD

BRIDGE BLOWN UP . THUS, SINCE 1960 MOST TRAFFIC HAS MOVED ON ALTERNATE

RAIL LINES THROUGH PORTUGUESE ANGOLA AND MOZAMBIQUE . BUT THE ROUTES

ACROSS FOREIGN TERRITORY SOAK UP REVENUE BADLY NEEDED WITHIN THE CONGO,

AND LAST WEEK PREMIER CYRILLE ADOULA HOPEFULLY DEDICATED A NEW RAILROAD

BRIDGE AT BUKAMA, THE FINAL REBUILT LINK IN THE KATANGA-MATADI RUN . "

THIS IS NOT ONLY A BRIDGE OVER THE LUALABA RIVER, " SAID ADOULA . " IT

IS A BRIDGE OVER THE UNHAPPY PAST . " THOUGH A MILESTONE OF SORTS, THE

BUKAMA BRIDGE ALSO MARKS THE PETTY PACE OF CONGOLESE UNITY, FOR THE

STEAMY 25-DAY TRIP BY BARGE AND BOXCAR REMAINS AN AWESOME OBSTACLE

COURSE . SOME OF THE 23 CONGOLESE PROVINCES CREATED SINCE 1962 CLAIM

AUTHORITY TO LEVY IMPORT-EXPORT DUTIES AS THE MOOD STRIKES THEM . ALSO,

TRIBAL TENSIONS NECESSITATE FREQUENT CHANGES OF ENGINEERS AS TRAINS

PASS FROM ONE REGION TO THE NEXT . IF THE LOCAL FOLK SPOT AN ENEMY AT

THE CONTROLS, THEY MIGHT SWARM ABOARD AND KILL HIM ON THE SPOT .

FRANCE A MAN OF EUROPE FLAGS FLEW AT HALF-MAST IN BRUSSELS

OVER THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE COMMON MARKET . THE TRIBUTE WAS IN HOMAGE

TO THAT GRAND OLD EUROCRAT, ROBERT SCHUMAN . HIS DEATH LAST WEEK AT 77

REMINDED THE WORLD THAT THE NEW EUROPE WHICH CHARLES DE GAULLE SO

GRANDLY PURPORTS TO HEAD OWES MUCH OF ITS IMPETUS TO OTHER FRENCHMEN

WITH BROADER HORIZONS . REARED IN LORRAINE WHILE IT WAS UNDER THE

KAISER'S RULE, SCHUMAN WAS A GERMAN FOR THE FIRST 33 YEARS OF HIS LIFE

. WHEN THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES RETURNED LORRAINE TO FRANCE AFTER WORLD

WAR I, HE BECAME FRENCH (ALTHOUGH HE NEVER LOST HIS GERMAN ACCENT) AND

WAS ELECTED A DEPUTY . EDUCATED IN THE LAW, LEAN AND TALL WITH A

TOOTHBRUSH MUSTACHE, THE ASCETIC SCHUMAN WAS A NATURAL FOR THE FINANCE

COMMISSION, WHERE HE SERVED FOR 17 YEARS . HE ATE CHEAP MEALS, PROWLED

HIS OFFICES SNAPPING OFF LIGHTS . A LIFELONG BACHELOR, SCHUMAN ONCE

ANSWERED THE DOOR OF HIS PARIS APARTMENT WEARING A MAID'S APRON ; HE

HAD BEEN DOING HIS OWN DUSTING . LONE LOSS . BUT WHEN IT CAME TO HIS

DREAM OF THE FUTURE EUROPE, SCHUMAN WAS A LEADER AMONG EUROPE'S POSTWAR

GENERATION OF CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC RADICAL INTEGRATIONISTS . AFTER

HELPING FOUND THE CATHOLIC M.R.P . AND TWICE SERVING AS POSTWAR PREMIER

OF FRANCE (FROM NOVEMBER 1947 TO JULY 1948, AND FOR ANOTHER BRIEF

PERIOD LATER IN 1948), SCHUMAN TOOK OVER THE FOREIGN MINISTER'S POST .

IN 1949, AFTER HELPING DRAW UP THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY BLUEPRINT, HE

SIGNED THE HISTORIC NATO PACT ON FRANCE'S BEHALF . IN 1950, IN LEAGUE

WITH ANOTHER FRENCH EUROCRAT, JEAN MONNET, HE PROPOSED THE " SCHUMAN

PLAN " FOR THE EUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITY, WHICH PROVED TO BE

THE FORERUNNER OF THE SIX-NATION COMMON MARKET, AND OF THE EURATOM POOL

FOR PEACEFUL NUCLEAR RESOURCES . IN 1954 SCHUMAN LOST HIS ONLY MAJOR

BATTLE A DRIVE FOR AN ALL-EUROPEAN ARMY (EDC) . NO ORATIONS . IN RECENT

YEARS SCHUMAN LIVED IN SEMIRETIREMENT AT HIS FAMILY ESTATE, PORING OVER

HIS RARE BOOKS (AMONG THEM THE HANDWRITTEN SCHOOL MANUSCRIPTS OF LOUIS

XIV) AND PENNING HIS MEMOIRS . INTIMATES SAY HE WAS " VERY UPSET " BY

DE GAULLE'S OPPOSITION TO BRITAIN'S ENTRY INTO THE COMMON MARKET ; BUT

HE KEPT HIS SILENCE . LAST MONTH, FELLED BY A CEREBRAL THROMBOSIS,

SCHUMAN RALLIED WEAKLY, BUT REMAINED BEDRIDDEN . WHEN NEWS OF HIS DEATH

WAS ANNOUNCED, MESSAGES OF EULOGY POURED IN FROM POPE PAUL, PRESIDENT

KENNEDY (HE " COMBINED VISION WITH REALISM " ), AND FROM DE GAULLE, WHO

ACKNOWLEDGED " THE HIGH CONSCIENCE WITH WHICH HE SERVED . " AT WEEK'S

END, WITH NO ORATIONS (AT HIS REQUEST), ROBERT SCHUMAN'S FUNERAL

SERVICE IN THE METZ CATHEDRAL WAS ATTENDED BY FIVE FORMER FRENCH

PREMIERS. EVENTUALLY HIS BODY IS TO LIE IN A SPECIAL MAUSOLEUM TO BE

BUILT FACING EASTWARD ACROSS THE RHINE .

AFTERWARD THE FIVE ANTOINE PINAY, GUY MOLLET,

PIERRE PFLIMLIN, RENE PLEVEN AND RENE MAYER WERE INVITED TO LUNCHEON AT

THE METZ PREFECTURE BY DE GAULLE'S REPRESENTATIVE, MINISTER OF STATE

LOUIS JOXE . BUT THE EX-PREMIERS DECLINED THE INVITATION WHEN THEY

LEARNED THAT SCHUMAN'S OLD FRIEND JEAN MONNET, WHO WAS ALSO PRESENT,

SOUTH VIET NAM REPORT ON THE WAR OVERSHADOWED

BY THE POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC TURMOIL IN SAIGON, THE ALL BUT

FORGOTTEN WAR AGAINST THE VIET CONG CONTINUES ON ITS UGLY, BLOODY AND

WEARISOME COURSE . THE DRIVE AGAINST THE COMMUNISTS HAS NOT DIMINISHED

IN RECENT WEEKS ; IN FACT, IT HAS INTENSIFIED . FEARS THAT THE

BUDDHIST CONTROVERSY MIGHT DAMAGE MORALE AMONG VIETNAMESE TROOPS HAVE

SO FAR BEEN GROUNDLESS . IF LAST WEEK'S BATTLES WERE ANY CRITERION, THE

GOVERNMENT SOLDIERS ARE FIGHTING BETTER THAN EVER AGAINST A COMMUNIST

FOE THAT IS EXACTING A HIDEOUS PRICE IN BLOOD IN THE FLOODED PADDIES OF

THE SOUTH . THE BIGGEST GOVERNMENT VICTORY IN MONTHS CAME LAST WEEK

NEAR THE TOWN OF GOCONG, 45 MILES SOUTH OF SAIGON . IN THE DEAD OF

NIGHT, 500 VIET CONG REGULARS SWOOPED DOWN ON A STRATEGIC HAMLET UNDER

A SCREEN OF SUPPORTING FIRE FROM HEAVY MACHINE GUNS AND RECOILLESS

RIFLES . DESPERATELY CALLING FOR HELP OVER THEIR RADIO, THE DEFENDERS

FOUGHT BACK DOGGEDLY, BUT WERE BARELY HOLDING OUT WHEN A GOVERNMENT

INFANTRY RELIEF COLUMN ARRIVED AT DAWN WITH 15 ARMORED PERSONNEL

CARRIERS . AMBUSHED BY THE REDS, THE GOVERNMENT REINFORCEMENTS DID NOT

PANIC, NOSED THEIR PERSONNEL CARRIERS OFF THE ROAD AND INTO THE

PADDIES, HEADING DIRECTLY FOR THE DUGIN REDS . FROM A GRAVEYARD AT THE

FRINGE OF THE BATTLEFIELD, A VIET CONG HEAVY MACHINE GUN KNOCKED OUT AN

APC . BUT SUPPORTED BY GOVERNMENT AIR FORCE PLANES, WHICH SWEPT OVER

THE RED POSITIONS IN SCREAMING, SHALLOW DIVES FIRING ROCKETS AND

DROPPING NAPALM, THE REINFORCEMENTS ROLLED STRAIGHT ONTO THE REDS,

MASHING SCORES OF THE COMMUNIST TROOPS INTO THE STINKING PADDY MUD WITH

THEIR HUGE STEEL TREADS . AT LAST THE REDS BROKE AND RAN, LEAVING

BEHIND 83 DEAD . MUTILATED BODIES . THE EPISODE MADE NO SIZABLE DENT IN

THE VIET CONG ARMY . BUT IT WAS HEARTENING TO U.S . MILITARY OBSERVERS,

WHO ON MANY PAST OCCASIONS HAD WATCHED THE GOVERNMENT'S TROOPS REFUSE

TO PRESS THEIR ATTACK . THIS TIME THE RELIEF COLUMN HAD STOOD ITS

GROUND UNDER THE VIET CONG POUNDING AND THEN MOVED IN ON THE REDS IN

BRUTAL COMBAT . TWO DAYS LATER, THE REDS EVENED THE SCORE . THIS TIME

THEY HIT THE RICE-RICH CAMAU PENINSULA, TRADITIONALLY

COMMUNIST-CONTROLLED TERRITORY WHERE GOVERNMENT ENCLAVES ARE ONLY

ISLANDS IN A SEA OF VIET CONG . THE PLAN WAS A CLEVER TWO-PRONGED

ATTACK AGAINST THE TWO GOVERNMENT-HELD CITIES OF CAI NUOC AND DAMDOI,

WHICH LIE 15 MILES APART ON THE SOUTHERNMOST TIP OF VIET NAM . TO

CONFUSE GOVERNMENT REINFORCEMENTS AND TO HAMPER THEIR SPEEDY ARRIVAL,

THE VIET CONG FIRST FEINTED AT THREE NEIGHBORING OUTPOSTS, SOWED MINES

ON A MAJOR ROAD OVER WHICH GOVERNMENT TROOPS HAD TO TRAVEL, AND POURED

HARASSING MORTAR FIRE ON A U.S . HELICOPTER AIRSTRIP IN THE AREA .

THE MILITARY FRONT SEEMED A MILLION

MILES FROM SAIGON LAST WEEK . FOUR WEEKS AFTER THE CRACKDOWN ON SOUTH

VIET NAM'S BUDDHIST OPPOSITION, AN ATMOSPHERE OF WATCHFUL WAITING HUNG

OVER THE CITY . STILL FEARFUL OF A COUP, THE GOVERNMENT STATIONED

SECRET POLICE OUTSIDE THE HOMES OF SUSPECT OFFICIALS ; TOP MILITARY

OFFICERS WERE ORDERED TO SLEEP AT MILITARY HEADQUARTERS SO THAT A CHECK

COULD BE KEPT ON THEIR WHEREABOUTS . WITH THE BUDDHIST OPPOSITION

LULLED FOR THE MOMENT, SAIGON'S STUDENT POPULATION FEEBLY TRIED TO

RAISE PROTESTS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT . PELTED WITH CHAIRS AND DESKS

THROWN FROM CLASSROOM WINDOWS, GOVERNMENT TROOPS CLOSED MANY OF

SAIGON'S SCHOOLS, THREW NEARLY 1,000 STUDENTS INTO JAIL TO COOL OFF .

IT SEEMED LIKELY THAT VIET CONG AGENTS INSPIRED MUCH OF THE

DEMONSTRATING . THIS MADE IT ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT FOR THE U.S . AND

PRESIDENT NGO DINH DIEM TO SETTLE THEIR DIFFERENCES . THE LATEST

EPISODES OFFERED LITTLE ASSURANCE OF THAT . COUCHING HIS WORDS IN THE

MOST CAREFUL DIPLOMATIC TERMS, U.S . AMBASSADOR HENRY CABOT LODGE LAST

WEEK SUGGESTED TO DIEM THAT HIS BROTHER AND FIERY SISTER-IN-LAW, NGO

DINH NHU AND MME . NHU, LEAVE THE COUNTRY UNTIL THE CURRENT CRISIS WAS

OVER AND A FRESH RAPPROCHEMENT

SHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT, THE REDS HIT CAI

NUOC DIRECTLY . POURING MORTAR SHELLS AND RECOILLESS RIFLE FIRE IN THE

PERIMETER SYSTEM OF DEFENSIVE BUNKERS, THE VIET CONG BREACHED THE FRONT

GATE OF THE CITY'S MAJOR OUTPOST, RAN FROM BUNKER TO BUNKER LOBBING IN

GRENADES AND SHOOTING THE DEFENDERS IN THE BACK . THE FIGHT LASTED FOR

ONLY 35 MINUTES, BUT THE REDS OCCUPIED THE TOWN FOR THE NEXT 17 HOURS .

IT WAS A BLOODBATH . WHEN REINFORCEMENTS FINALLY APPEARED, THEY FOUND A

HEAP OF 50 MUTILATED BODIES, INCLUDING WOMEN AND CHILDREN, WHICH THE

REDS HAD SET AFIRE . OF THE 100-MAN DEFENDING FORCE, ONLY 25 SURVIVED .

EXPERTS DIFFER . SOON THEREAFTER, THE REDS OVERRAN THE NEIGHBORING TOWN

OF DAMDOI . BUT THIS TIME THE COMMUNISTS MADE THE MISTAKE OF STAYING

TOO LONG . SEVEN HOURS AFTER THE VIET CONG OCCUPIED THE TOWN,

GOVERNMENT MARINES, AIRLIFTED TO THE SCENE IN U.S . HELICOPTERS,

COUNTERATTACKED . HALF THE MARINE FORCE BLOCKED THE REDS' ESCAPE ROUTE

AND ATTACKED THEIR SANDBAGGED POSITIONS . ARMED HELICOPTERS UNLOADED

SOME 80 ROCKETS INTO THE COMMUNIST DEFENSES, AND FIGHTER PLANES ZOOMED

IN AT TREETOP LEVEL WITH GUNS BLAZING . WHEN THE REDS FINALLY

DISAPPEARED INTO THE PADDIES AFTER AN ALL-DAY FIGHT, THEY LEFT BEHIND

60 DEAD   BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE POPULATION ESTABLISHED

. LODGE HINTED DELICATELY THAT THE CONTINUED PRESENCE OF THE BITTERLY

CONTROVERSIAL NHUS IN SOUTH VIET NAM NOT ONLY HAMPERED THE WAR EFFORT

AGAINST THE COMMUNIST VIET CONG, BUT COULD ALSO " ENDANGER " U.S .

CONGRESSIONAL APPROPRIATIONS TO DIEM'S GOVERNMENT . DIEM EXPRESSED

SURPRISE AND SHOCK AT LODGE'S SUGGESTION, COLDLY TURNED IT DOWN ; HE

MIGHT HAVE WONDERED HOW JOHN F . KENNEDY WOULD HAVE FELT IF VIET NAM

HAD ASKED FOR THE EXILE OF BOBBY AND ETHEL . WHAT NEXT IN U.S . POLICY

? IT WAS A TIME OF FRANTIC PONDERING AND FRANTIC DISCUSSION IN

WASHINGTON . SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS WERE LUDICROUS : CUT OFF ALL AID

TO DIEM (WHICH WOULD EFFECTIVELY HAND THE COUNTRY TO THE COMMUNISTS) ;

RUN THE SEVENTH FLEET UP TO THE COAST AND FORCE DIEM OUT OF POWER (ALSO

SENSELESS, SINCE NO SUITABLE SUCCESSOR WAS VISIBLE) . NO ONE SEEMED TO

BE DISCUSSING PERHAPS THE MOST SENSIBLE SOLUTION OF ALL : STOP ALL THE

HALFWAY HINTS OF ENCOURAGEMENT TO PROMOTERS OF A COUP D'ETAT, AND GET

ON WITH THE DIFFICULT AND UNPALATABLE TASK OF WORKING WITH NGO DINH

DIEM AND HIS FAMILY . FACED WITH A PROFUSION OF PROPOSALS FOR ACTION,

PRESIDENT KENNEDY WAS KEEPING HIS MIND OPEN . AT HIS PRESS CONFERENCE,

HE REFUSED ALL EFFORTS TO DRAG HIM INTO A DISCUSSION

THE GOVERNMENT'S

MARINES WERE ALSO BADLY BATTERED ; 48 WERE KILLED BY THE TIME THE

SHOOTING STOPPED . ON THE BASIS OF BODIES, THIS MIGHT BE CALLED A

GOVERNMENT VICTORY . NOT SO INSIST SOME AMERICAN MILITARY MEN WHO ARGUE

THAT SUCH DEFENSIVE RESPONSES WHATEVER THE PENALTY IN LIVES TO THE

COMMUNIST ENEMY ARE WASTING THE STRENGTH OF THE VIETNAMESE FORCES AS

WELL AS THE $1,500,000 A DAY THE U.S . IS PUMPING INTO THE COUNTRY .

THESE EXPERTS WILL NOT BE HAPPY UNTIL THE GOVERNMENT CAN ORGANIZE

REGULAR " SEARCH AND HOLD " OPERATIONS IN THE SOUTHERN RICE COUNTRY,

COMMUNISM'S STRONGHOLD . IT IS AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TASK . THOUGH

THE VIET CONG ARE LOSING MORE MEN (CURRENTLY ABOUT 500 A WEEK) ALL THE

TIME, THERE ARE MORE TO BE KILLED ,; OFFICIALS IN SAIGON NOW ESTIMATE

THAT HARD-CORE COMMUNIST STRENGTH HAS GONE UP FROM 23,000 TO 31,000

OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS . BUT GOVERNMENT STRIKES ARE AT LEAST MORE AND

MORE FREQUENT . IN THE FIRST WEEK OF SEPTEMBER, 55 SEPARATE OFFENSIVE

GROUND ACTIONS OF BATTALION STRENGTH OR LARGER WERE UNDER WAY, CLOSE TO

AN ALLTIME RECORD . CONVERSELY, RED ATTACKS ALSO INCREASED FROM 300 TO

400 IN THE SAME PERIOD . AS THIS WEEK'S OPERATIONS ILLUSTRATE, HOWEVER,

MANY GOVERNMENT TROOPS HAVE LEARNED TO STAND AND FIGHT .

PERSONALITIES AND SAID SIMPLY : " WHAT HELPS THE WAR WE SUPPORT

; WHAT INTERFERES WITH THE WAR EFFORT WE OPPOSE . WE ARE NOT THERE TO

SEE A WAR LOST . THAT IS OUR POLICY . " AS IF TO QUIET U.S .

NERVOUSNESS, DIEM AT WEEK'S END ANNOUNCED THAT MARTIAL LAW, WHICH HAS

BEEN IN EFFECT FOR ALMOST A MONTH, WILL END THIS WEEK, FORESHADOWING A

POSSIBLE RETURN TO NORMALCY IN SOUTH VIET NAM .

DRAGON LADY, DRAGONFLY IN A BLAZE OF FLASHBULBS, MME . NGO DINH

NHU LEFT SAIGON LAST WEEK ON A TRIP TO BEIRUT, BELGRADE, AND POINTS

WEST . ELABORATELY COIFFED AND GOWNED, SHE MET REPORTERS AND DEFENDED

HER VIEWS, ATTACKED HER ENEMIES, DODGED OVERLY CURVED QUESTIONS, AND

DISPLAYED AN INCREDIBLY FASCINATING FEMININE CHARM . WHETHER TWIRLING A

HER WORDS . THE DIEM GOVERNMENT WOULD NEVER YIELD TO " PERFIDIOUS

BLACKMAILING ATTACKS, " SHE EXCLAIMED . WHAT ABOUT THE CONCERN FOR

SOUTH VIET NAM'S BUDDHISTS VOICED BY THE VATICAN ? POPE PAUL VI IS

TOO " EASILY WORRIED, " RETORTED MME . NHU . HER ACID REMARK

SUPPLEMENTED EARLIER COMMENTS ON THE SAME SUBJECT ON FRENCH TELEVISION

SOMETHING EX CATHEDRA . I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT HE WILL PUT HIMSELF IN

HIS CHAIR TO DISAVOW ME, BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE A VERY BAD BLOW TO

CATHOLICISM . " REPORTS THAT SHE WOULD NOT STAY AT THE CONFERENCE UNTIL

ITS CONCLUSION LEFT OFFICIALS NEAR CONSTERNATION . " IF MME . NHU

LEAVES ONE DAY EARLY, D ONE, " THEN THE CONFERENCE WILL HAVE LOST ITS

IMPORTANCE . " BUT SHE SHOWED EVERY SIGN OF ENJOYING HERSELF . LETTING

BIT UNHAPPY WITH SOUTH VIET NAM'S WHOLE RULING FAMILY, MME . NHU

SUGGESTED THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS " MISINFORMED ABOUT THE SITUATION IN

OPPOSITION, HE TRIES TO APPEASE IT . " TWO DAYS LATER SHE HAD LUNCH

WITH ANOTHER DELEGATE AT THE CONFERENCE . IT WAS NONE OTHER THAN THE

PRESIDENT'S BROTHER, SENATOR EDWARD M . KENNEDY . LIKE OTHERS ON THE

U.S . DELEGATION, TEDDY KENNEDY HAD HALFWAY HOPED TO AVOID THE

CONFRONTATION . BUT THEY HAD A CHAT . A LONG CHAT . " SHE DISCUSSED AT

LENGTH HER SIDE OF THE PICTURE, " SAID TEDDY LATER . " SHE WANTED TO

SOUTH VIET NAM BIRTH AT GENEVA AT 10 : 42 A.M., PEKING

TIME, WEDNESDAY, JULY 21, 1954, THE WAR IN INDO-CHINA CAME TO AN END .

THE RESULT HAD BEEN A FOREGONE CONCLUSION SINCE THE IGNOMINIOUS FRENCH

DEFEAT BY THE COMMUNIST VIET MINH AT DIENBIENPHU TWO MONTHS EARLIER .

EVEN BEFORE THAT, DIPLOMATS FROM NINE NATIONS, HALFWAY ROUND THE WORLD

IN GENEVA, HAD BEEN WORKING FEVERISHLY TO HAMMER OUT THE FINAL PEACE

SETTLEMENT . FEARFUL THAT HIGHLEVEL PARTICIPATION IN GENEVA MIGHT PUT

THE U.S . IN THE POSITION OF APPROVING A SELLOUT TO THE REDS, PRESIDENT

EISENHOWER AND SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN FOSTER DULLES WERE HESITANT

ABOUT ENDORSING THE CONFERENCE . BUT WHEN FRENCH PREMIER PIERRE

MENDES-FRANCE SAID THAT HE NEEDED U.S . SUPPORT TO AVOID UNNECESSARY

CONCESSIONS, WASHINGTON SENT UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE WALTER BEDELL

SMITH BACK TO GENEVA TO STIFFEN HIM UP . . (BULLET HERE) IN GENEVA,

DIPLOMATS ARGUED OVER HOW INDO-CHINA SHOULD BE PARTITIONED . WHEN

DISCUSSIONS APPEARED TO BE GETTING NOWHERE, MENDESFRANCE IMPOSED A

DEADLINE AFTER WHICH HE THREATENED TO RESIGN A MOVE THAT WOULD HAVE

BROUGHT THE CONFERENCE TO A GRINDING HALT AND CONTINUED A WAR THAT

COULD NOT BE WON . PRODDED BY THIS ULTIMATUM, THE CONFERENCE FINALLY

AGREED ON TERMS THAT WOULD PARTITION VIET NAM AT THE 17TH PARALLEL .

THE AGREEMENT GAVE THE VIET MINH THE INDUSTRIAL NORTH, LEAVING THE

GOVERNMENT OF NGO DINH DIEM WITH THE RICE-RICH SOUTH . NEW MILITARY

BASES WERE PROHIBITED, AND CIVILIANS WERE PERMITTED TO LEAVE ONE ZONE

TO TAKE UP RESIDENCE IN THE OTHER (NEARLY 800,000 NORTH VIETNAMESE

MOVED TO THE SOUTH, BUT ONLY A FEW THOUSAND SOUTHERNERS MOVED NORTH) .

ELECTIONS TO UNIFY VIET NAM WERE SUPPOSED TO BE HELD IN 1956, BUT DIEM

REPUDIATED THIS WITH THE ARGUMENT THAT ANY ELECTION IN THE COMMUNIST

NORTH WOULD BE RIGGED . THE CONFERENCE SET UP AN INTERNATIONAL CONTROL

COMMISSION OF INDIA, POLAND AND CANADA TO INVESTIGATE ALL BORDER

VIOLATIONS AND ARBITRATE ALL TREATY DISAGREEMENTS ; BUT THE I.C.C.'S

TROIKA ARRANGEMENT STYMIED WHATEVER EFFECTIVENESS IT HAD . . (BULLET

HERE) IN JANUARY 1955, THE U.S., AT DIEM'S REQUEST, TOOK OVER THE

PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TRAINING OF THE VIETNAMESE ARMY AS PART

OF DULLES' EFFORT UNDER THE SEATO TREATY TO CURB COMMUNIST SUBVERSION

IN SOUTHEAST ASIA . THOUGH THE U.S . POURED IN LAVISH ECONOMIC AID, THE

TOTAL U.S . MILITARY STRENGTH ASSIGNED TO THE MILITARY ASSISTANCE GROUP

DID NOT EXCEED 2,000 MEN . BUT AS THE COMMUNIST VIET CONG GUERRILLAS

BEGAN INCREASING THEIR TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT, THE

U.S . STARTED TO GET SERIOUSLY CONCERNED . IN OCTOBER 1961, GENERAL

MAXWELL D . TAYLOR VISITED SOUTH VIET NAM, CAME BACK WITH THE OUTLINE

OF A VASTLY STEPPED-UP PROGRAM OF U.S . MILITARY AID . TODAY, TOTAL U.S

. STRENGTH IN SOUTH VIET NAM IS ABOUT 14,000 MEN . THE VIETNAMESE ARMY

IS ALMOST COMPLETELY ARMED WITH U.S . WEAPONS, AND U.S . ARMY

HELICOPTERS FERRY GOVERNMENT TROOPS ON PRACTICALLY EVERY LONG-RANGE

FRANCE COPING WITH AN OLD FOE THE JOKE IN PARIS WAS THAT CHARLES

DE GAULLE DID NOT KNOW BIFTECK PRICES WERE GOING UP UNTIL HIS WIFE,

TANTE YVONNE, TOLD HIM . WHEREVER DE GAULLE GOT THE NEWS ABOUT FRENCH

INFLATION, HE MOVED SWIFTLY LAST WEEK TO BRING IT UNDER CONTROL .

INFLATION IS AS TYPICALLY FRENCH AS ARE STREET DEMONSTRATIONS AND OFTEN

THE TWO ARE LINKED . ALL FRENCH GOVERNMENTS TEND TO GRAPPLE VAINLY WITH

THE PROBLEM . PREMIER PAUL RAMADIER FOUGHT A GAME BUT LOSING BATTLE IN

1947 ; PREMIER ANTOINE PINAY LAUNCHED A " SAVE THE FRANC " CAMPAIGN IN

1952 . NOW DE GAULLE IS STRUGGLING AGAINST THE SAME HYDRAHEADED ENEMY

: RISING PRICES, UP 16 PER CENT IN THREE YEARS ; WAGE BOOSTS, WHICH

ONLY INCREASE THE COST SPIRAL ; AND THE FURY OF FARMERS .

IN AN UNUSUAL MOVE, DE GAULLE SUMMONED HIS CABINET DURING THE

VACATION MONTH OF AUGUST, AND SOURLY NOTED THAT WITHOUT ECONOMIC AND

FINANCIAL STABILITY FRANCE COULD NOT HAVE THE GLORIOUS " POLICY

CONSISTENT WITH HER INTERESTS . " PREMIER GEORGES POMPIDOU, AN

EX-BANKER, CANDIDLY SAID THAT ALL FRENCHMEN WERE JIGGLING TAX RETURNS A

BIT IN THEIR OWN FAVOR, LAMENTED THAT " WHILE AN AMERICAN ALWAYS WANTS

TO DEMONSTRATE THAT HE EARNS MORE THAN HIS NEIGHBOR, THE FRENCHMAN

ALWAYS WANTS TO SHOW YOU HE EARNS LESS . " CREDIT RESTRICTIONS AND

BUDGETARY MEASURES HIGHLIGHTED THE NEW CORRECTIVE PLAN ANNOUNCED BY THE

GOVERNMENT LAST WEEK . BANKS ARE LIMITED TO A 10 PER CENT INCREASE IN

LOAN PORTFOLIOS . INSTALLMENT BUYING HAS BEEN TIGHTENED BY INCREASING

DOWN PAYMENTS . IN A NATIONWIDE TV SPEECH, FINANCE MINISTER VALERY

GISCARD D'ESTAING SAID THE SUCCESS OF THE PLAN DEPENDS " ON TWO THINGS

: CONSCIENCE AND CONFIDENCE . " THE PRESS WAS NEITHER HOSTILE NOR

ENTHUSIASTIC . AS USUAL, CHARLES DE GAULLE HAD THE LAST WORD . TO HIS

FORMOSA LITTLE CHIANG WHEN THE UNITED AIRLINES JET

LANDED AT WASHINGTON AIRPORT LAST WEEK, GENERAL CHIANG CHING-KUO WALKED

UNNOTICED PAST THE WAITING RECEPTION COMMITTEE OF U.S . OFFICIALS AND

CHINESE DIPLOMATS . IT WAS NOT UNTIL MOMENTS LATER THAT THEY SPOTTED

HIM, A CHUNKY MAN IN A NONDESCRIPT BUSINESS SUIT, PATIENTLY EXAMINING

THE MODERNISTIC INTERIOR OF THE DULLES TERMINAL BUILDING . THE

COMMITTEE'S MISTAKE, AND THE GENERAL'S DEMEANOR, WERE BOTH SIGNIFICANT

. THOUGH THE ELDEST SON OF CHIANG KAI-SHEK, NATIONALIST CHINA'S

VENERABLE PRESIDENT, CHIANG CHING-KUO, 53, IS THE MYSTERY MAN OF

FORMOSA WHO AVOIDS THE LIMELIGHT . PARTLY, THE MYSTERY HAS PROFESSIONAL

REASONS : AS CHIEF OF FORMOSA'S SECRET POLICE AND HEAD OF THE

GUERRILLA ACTIVITIES DIRECTED AGAINST RED CHINA, HE NATURALLY SEEKS THE

SHADOWS . FORMOSAN BESTSELLER . THE VISIT TO THE U.S., HIS FIRST IN

TEN YEARS,

IS SAID TO BE WITHOUT SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE . HE CONFERRED WITH

INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS AT BOTH THE CIA AND THE PENTAGON, DISCUSSED THE

LATEST ESTIMATES OF CONDITIONS ON THE RED CHINESE MAINLAND . BETWEEN

CONFERENCES, HE SQUEEZED IN A ONE-DAY JET FLIGHT TO CAPE CANAVERAL . HE

ALSO HAD A 75-MINUTE CONFERENCE WITH THE PRESIDENT AND PRESENTED HIM

WITH A COPY OF PROFILES IN COURAGE IN A CHINESE TRANSLATION, ADDING

THAT IT WAS A BESTSELLER ON FORMOSA . KENNEDY AND TOP U.S . OFFICIALS

WERE SEEING FACE TO FACE THE MAN WHO MAY WELL SUCCEED HIS FATHER AS

PRESIDENT OF NATIONALIST CHINA . ON FORMOSA, CHINGKUO IS KNOWN AS "

LITTLE CHIANG, " AND HIS ONLY MAJOR RIVAL FOR THE TOP JOB IS VICE

PRESIDENT CHEN CHENG, WHO SUFFERS FROM A LIVER AILMENT AND HAS BEEN IN

SEMIRETIREMENT SINCE JUNE . BORN IN CHEKIANG PROVINCE TO THE GIMO'S

FIRST WIFE, A PEASANT GIRL WHO WAS LATER KILLED IN A JAPANESE BOMBING

RAID, CHING-KUO WAS 16 WHEN THE GIMO SENT HIM TO MOSCOW IN 1925 " TO

LEARN MORE ABOUT REVOLUTIONARY IDEAS . " HE JOINED THE KOMSOMOL AND

STUDIED GUERRILLA TACTICS AT A RED ARMY ACADEMY . WHEN CHIANG KAI-SHEK

BROKE WITH THE COMMUNISTS IN 1927, A LETTER OVER CHING-KUO'S NAME

APPEARED IN PRAVDA DENOUNCING HIS FATHER AS A " TRAITOR . " HE SAYS THE

LETTER WAS A FORGERY . CHING-KUO HIMSELF BROKE WITH STALIN ON THE ISSUE

OF TROTSKYISM AND PUT IN SOME YEARS OF HARD WORK IN GOLD MINES AND

FACTORIES . WHEN THE JAPANESE THREAT FORGED A NEW BOND BETWEEN STALIN

AND THE GIMO IN 1937, CHING-KUO WAS PERMITTED TO LEAVE FOR CHINA WITH

HIS SHY, APPEALING RUSSIAN WIFE FANINA AND THEIR SON ALAN . SPOT & MOP

. OVERJOYED AT HIS SON'S RETURN, THE GIMO NEVERTHELESS THOUGHT HIM TOO

RUSSIAN IN HIS OUTLOOK AND HAD HIM TUTORED FOR TWO YEARS TO " MAKE HIM

CHINESE AGAIN . " EVER SINCE, CHING-KUO HAS LOYALLY AND EFFICIENTLY

HANDLED A SUCCESSION OF JOBS FOR HIS FATHER, RANGING FROM OPERATING A

CONCENTRATION CAMP FOR COMMUNIST SUSPECTS ON GREEN ISLAND TO CREATING A

SYSTEM OF POLITICAL COMMISSARS TO CHECK ON LOYALTY IN THE ARMY . UNDER

CHING-KUO, NATIONALIST GUERRILLAS PROBE THE MAINLAND FOR SOFT SPOTS IN

THE DEFENSES AND PUBLIC DISAFFECTION WITH THE RED REGIME . OVER THE

PAST TWO YEARS, SOME 1,500 MEN HAVE BEEN PUT ASHORE IN CHEKIANG AND

KWANGTUNG PROVINCES . IN U.S . OPINION, INDIVIDUAL SABOTEURS OFTEN

COMPLETE THEIR MISSIONS, BUT MOST LARGE RAIDING PARTIES HAVE BEEN

QUICKLY SPOTTED AND MOPPED UP BY THE RED CHINESE .

CHING-KUO HAS REPEATEDLY BEEN ACCUSED OF

ENGAGING IN SECRET TALKS WITH PEKING, PRESUMABLY WITH THE OBJECT OF

MAKING A DEAL AFTER THE GIMO'S DEATH . THOSE WHO KNOW HIM BEST SCOFF AT

THE IDEA THAT HE WOULD EVER HAND FORMOSA OVER TO PEKING . SINO-MARXIST

AMALGAM . WITH NO FORMAL UNIVERSITY EDUCATION, CHING-KUO COMMANDS

LITTLE LOYALTY AMONG NATIONALIST CHINA'S INTELLECTUALS, AND HIS

NONCONFORMIST METHODS IRRITATE THE TOP POLITICIANS OF THE KUOMINTANG .

HE IS BACKED BY HIS DASHING HALF BROTHER, MAJOR GENERAL CHIANG WEI-KUO,

47 . AS MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO IN THE CABINET AND SPECIAL ADVISER

TO THE PRESIDENT, CHINGKUO WORKS CLOSELY WITH HIS FATHER . ANOTHER

SOURCE OF STRENGTH IS CHING-KUO'S 100,000-MAN YOUTH CORPS, AND HIS VETO

POWER OVER PROMOTIONS IN THE ARMY GIVES HIM ENORMOUS INFLUENCE WITH

JUNIOR OFFICERS . WITH HIS TWO OLDER CHILDREN MARRIED, CHING-KUO LIVES

IN A MODEST HOME IN TAIPEI WITH HIS WIFE AND TWO YOUNGER SONS . HIS DAY

BEGINS AT 6 : 00 A.M . WITH AN HOUR'S PRACTICE IN CHINESE CALLIGRAPHY

AND PAINTING, AND CONTINUES IN HIS OFFICE UNTIL MIDNIGHT . HE LIKES

HIKING IN THE MOUNTAINS, BUT SINCE SUFFERING FROM MILD DIABETES HAS HAD

TO FORGO CONVIVIAL DRINKING MOSTLY VODKA . ONE OLD FRIEND SEES

CHING-KUO AS " AN AMALGAM OF THE CHINESE TRADITION AND MARXIST IDEAS .

/ WHAT STRIKES MOST OBSERVERS IS HIS STRANGE COMBINATION OF SHYNESS AND

POWER . A CHINESE FRIEND PERHAPS PUT IT BEST WHEN HE SAID, " LOOK AT

HIS HANDS THERE'S THE MAN : COARSE, TOUGH,PATIENT . " AS HIS TRIP TO

WASHINGTON NEARED ITS END LAST WEEK, THE MYSTERY MAN MET NEWSMEN, WHO

FOUND HIM SEATED ON A GOLD-EMBROIDERED SOFA IN THE CHINESE EMBASSY .

RED CHINA, SAID CHING-KUO THROUGH HIS INTERPRETER, IS AT ITS WEAKEST

POINT IN HISTORY AND FORMOSA CORRESPONDINGLY AT ITS STRONGEST . HIS

VISIT WAS INTENDED TO BRING ABOUT " COMMON UNDERSTANDING " BETWEEN HIS

COUNTRY AND THE U.S . DID THAT MEAN THERE WERE MISUNDERSTANDINGS ?

CHING-KUO REPLIED WITH A LOUD " NO ! " EVEN BEFORE THE QUESTION WAS

TRANSLATED . WITH A BRISK, " THAT'S ALL, " THE INTERVIEW WAS CONCLUDED,

AND CHING-KUO DROVE OFF TO PRINCETON, N.J., TO ENJOY THE ONE U.S .

A SIGH OF RELIEF, SOVIET TRAINMEN CHUGGED OFF TOWARD MOSCOW IN THE

REPLACEMENT TRAIN . IT MIGHT WELL BE THE LAST TRIP IN A LONG TIME FOR

SOUTH AFRICA A DAY AT THE STADIOM ONE OF THE FEW WAYS THAT SOUTH

AFRICA'S HAPLESS BLACKS AND COLOREDS HAVE TO EXPRESS THEIR DISMAY AT

APARTHEID IT TO BOO VIGOROUSLY THE ALL-WHITE HOME TEAMS AT

INTERNATIONAL SPORTS CONTESTS . IN 1955 THE UNPATRIOTIC FAVORITISM OF

NONWHITES AT A RUGBY GAME WITH GREAT BRITAIN AT BLOEMFONTEIN BROUGHT

ABOUT A RACIAL SLUGFEST THAT RESULTED IN A TENYEAR BAN ON BLACK AND

COLORED SPECTATORS IN THAT CITY ; FIVE YEARS AGO, A SIMILAR CLASH

FORCED OFFICIALS TO HALT A SOUTH AFRICA-BRITAIN SOCCER MATCH IN

JOHANNESBURG'S RAND STADIUM . NONE OF THESE FEUDS MATCHED THE BATTLE

FROM WHICH PORT ELIZABETH WAS RECOVERING LAST WEEK . THERE 50,000 WHITE

FANS WERE ON HAND TO WATCH SOUTH AFRICA'S SPRINGBOKS FACE AUSTRALIA IN

THE FINAL MATCH OF THIS YEAR'S RUGGER WORLD SERIES ; SOUTH AFRICA,

WHICH HAS HELD THE CHAMPIONSHIP FOR NEARLY 50 YEARS, WAS BEHIND TWO

GAMES TO ONE . THIS WAS QUITE ALL RIGHT WITH THE CROWD OF 5,000

NONWHITES, WHICH INSIDE ITS SEGREGATED ENCLOSURE FELT NO SYMPATHY FOR

THE LOCALS . WITH THE VISITORS AHEAD IN THIS FINAL MATCH, THE NONWHITES

CHEERED SO LOUDLY THAT THE PUZZLED AUSTRALIAN PLAYERS WERE TAKEN ABACK

. THEN, WITH 18 MINUTES TO PLAY, SOUTH AFRICA BOUNCED BACK TO TIE THE

SCORE AND THE BLACK BLEACHERS EXPLODED IN A ROAR OF ANGUISH . NONWHITES

BEGAN POURING OVER THEIR FENCE ONTO THE FIELD, HURLING BOTTLES AND

BRICKS . POLICE WITH DRAWN CLUBS RUSHED THEM, JOINED BY VOLUNTEER

WHITES . A WHITE FARMER EMPTIED HIS PISTOL INTO THE AIR . ON THE FIELD,

SOUTH AFRICAN FORWARD DICK PUTTER WAS CUT IN THE MOUTH BY ONE MISSILE,

AND AS A BOTTLE SPUN TOWARD REFEREE PIET MYBURGH, A HUSKY AUSTRALIAN

SAVED HIM WITH A FLYING TACKLE . AFTER PLAY RESUMED, SOUTH AFRICA WON,

22 TO 6 . THE SCORE AMONG THE SPECTATORS : SIX WHITES AND 20 NONWHITES

HOSPITALIZED, TWO NONWHITES ARRESTED, 40 CARS IN THE PARKING LOT

DAMAGED FROM ROCKS RAINED ONTO THEM FROM THE BLACK STANDS . POSSIBLY

HINTING THAT NONWHITES MAY BE BARRED FROM ALL STADIUMS, FOREIGN

MINISTER ERIC LOUW THUNDERED THAT " ACTIVE MEASURES ARE NECESSARY TO

PREVENT THIS SORT OF THING, " WHICH, HE COMPLAINED, " IS GIVING SOUTH

AFRICA A BAD NAME OVERSEAS . " AS FOR PORT ELIZABETH, THE AUTHORITIES

THERE DECIDED THAT THE WISE COURSE WOULD BE TO SELL NO MORE BEVERAGES

IN BOTTLES AND TO DOUBLE THE ADMISSION PRICE FOR NONWHITES AT FUTURE

SOMEONE SHOUTED AT THEM FROM A SECOND-STORY WINDOW OF THE SUPPLY

SQUADRON BARRACKS . NO ONE KNOWS WHO DID THE SHOUTING . NO ONE AGREES

ON WHAT WAS SHOUTED . BUT UNQUESTIONABLY, THE SHOUTS CONTAINED WHAT

NEGRO SOLDIERS AT EVREUX CALL " THE MAGIC WORD " NIGGER . RUSHING INTO

THEIR OWN BARRACKS, THE NEGROES GRABBED 12IN . METAL RODS USED TO

TRANSFORM BEDS INTO BUNKS AND RACED ACROSS THE STREET . FIRST THERE WAS

MUCH PUSHING, SHOUTING AND LOUD ARGUMENT . THEN A FIGHT BROKE OUT,

LASTING APPROXIMATELY 30 SECONDS . WHEN IT WAS OVER, SIX WHITE AIRMEN

WERE HOSPITALIZED WITH HEAD WOUNDS . NONE OF THE INJURIES SEEMED

SERIOUS, BUT AT DAWN AIRMAN FIRST CLASS ROBERT PADGETT, 23, OF

ROAD AND ADD UP THEIR IQS AND YOU WOULDN'T GET 200 . " AT WEEK'S END

MALAYSIA TEAM REPORTED THAT BOTH NORTH BORNEO AND SARAWAK FAVORED THE

FEDERATION . AS THE NEW NATION PREPARED TO UNFURL ITS

RED-AND-WHITE-STRIPED FLAG, HARRY LEE WAS QUICK TO CAPITALIZE ON THE

OCCASION . WITH HIS POPULARITY AT ITS ZENITH FOR HIS MAJOR ROLE IN

BRINGING THE FEDERATION ABOUT, HE SCHEDULED IMMEDIATE ELECTIONS IN

ABRUPTLY, AT 9 : 45 P.M., THE BARRAGE BEGAN FIRST AGAINST THE

PALACE GUARD BARRACKS, WHERE A MORTAR AND ARTILLERY ATTACK WENT ON FOR

HOURS . WHEN IT CAME TIME FOR THE BIG PUSH ON THE PALACE ITSELF, THERE

WAS A DANGER THAT VIETNAMESE AND AMERICAN FAMILIES WHO LIVED IN AN

ADJACENT RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD WOULD BE HIT BY SHELLS . SO, WELL

AFTER MIDNIGHT, A FORCE OF 18 TANKS SUPPORTED BY ARMORED CARS AND 600

FOOT SOLDIERS WENT THROUGH A COMPLICATED MANEUVER THAT BROUGHT THEM

CIRCUITOUSLY TO THE PALACE GROUNDS . AT 4 A.M., FROM SEVERAL SIDE

STREETS, THE ATTACKING COLUMNS BEGAN POURING POINT-BLANK FIRE FROM

TANKS, CANNONS, MACHINE GUNS AND RIFLES AT THE PROTECTIVE WALLS . BACK

CAME A MURDEROUS COUNTERFIRE, EVERYTHING DIEM'S DEFENDERS HAD LEFT .

FIRST ONE DIEM TANK CAUGHT FIRE AND EXPLODED IN A TOWER OF SMOKE AND

FLAME . THEN ANOTHER WAS KNOCKED OUT OF ACTION . TWO OF THE REBELS'

TANKS WERE ALSO DESTROYED . A CHORUS OF CHEERS . WITH HUGE HOLES NOW

GAPING IN THE FENCES, AND THE DEFENDERS SCATTERING INSIDE THE GROUNDS,

THE WAY WAS CLEAR FOR THE FINAL PUSH . THEN SUDDENLY, AT 6 : 15 A.M.,

EVERYTHING FELL SILENT AGAIN . A REBEL GENERAL, WHO THROUGHOUT THE

BATTLE HAD BEEN IN CONSTANT TOUCH WITH DIEM AND NHU BY TELEPHONE, HAD

CALLED FOR A FIVE-MINUTE GRACE PERIOD TO ALLOW THE BESIEGED PRESIDENT

AND HIS PARTY TO EMERGE . BUT NO ONE CAME OUT, AND THE CANNON FIRING

RESUMED, SMASHING WINDOWS, SPLINTERING DOORS, KNOCKING CHUNKS OFF THE

PALACE WALLS . THE RIFLEMEN, BELLYFLAT ON THE GROUND, SNIPED HAPPILY AT

DIEM'S LAST-DITCH SUPPORTERS . THE BATTLE WAS CLEARLY OVER, AND 17

MINUTES LATER, BY DAWN'S FIRST LIGHT, REPORTED TIME CORRESPONDENT

MURRAY GART, " I COULD SEE A WHITE FLAG BEING WAVED FROM A FIRST-FLOOR

WINDOW ON THE PALACE'S SOUTHWEST CORNER . BUT THERE WAS MORE SHOOTING

FROM THE PALACE . THEN THE WHITE FLAG WAVED AGAIN AND FIRING STOPPED .

AT FIRST CAUTIOUSLY, THEN FREELY, THE CAMOUFLAGE-SUITED REBELS BEGAN TO

STAND UP, AND A CHORUS OF CHEERS WELLED UP FROM THE STREETS .

WESTERN-STYLE, THEY FIRED THEIR GUNS IN THE AIR, AND RUSHED INTO THE

SIEVED FORTRESS . " AFTER ALL THEIR EFFORT, THE REBEL SOLDIERS DECIDED

THAT A LITTLE LOOTING WAS IN ORDER . MERRILY, THEY RAN FROM ROOM TO

ROOM, RIPPING DOWN CURTAINS FOR SOUVENIRS, GRABBING PIECES OF CHINA .

ONE SOLDIER GRABBED A CALENDAR THAT BORE DIEM'S PICTURE, STUFFED IT IN

HIS SHIRT . ANOTHER MADE OFF WITH A TWO-FOOT JAPANESE DOLL THAT HE

HUGGED FONDLY TO HIS BREAST .

THE OFFICIAL STORY . FORGOTTEN FOR THE MOMENT WERE DIEM AND

NHU . A FEW HOURS LATER, THE UGLY FACTS BEGAN TO EMERGE . FIRST, THERE

WAS THE OFFICIAL STORY . A SPOKESMAN FOR THE MILITARY JUNTA ANNOUNCED

THAT THE PAIR HAD SLIPPED OUT OF REBEL HANDS DURING THE CEASE-FIRE,

BOARDED A DEPARTING TRUCK WHILE WOUNDED WERE BEING REMOVED, AND SOMEHOW

REACHED A CATHOLIC CHURCH IN THE CHINESE QUARTER OF SUBURBAN CHOLON .

THERE, ACCORDING TO THE STORY, BOTH KILLED THEMSELVES AT 10 : 45 A.M .

IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN INCREDIBLE END FOR SUCH DEVOUT ADHERENTS OF ROMAN

CATHOLICISM, WHICH STERNLY CONDEMNS SUICIDE . BUT, IN FACT, THE

PRESIDENT AND HIS BROTHER WERE OBVIOUSLY MURDERED . ACCORDING TO ONE

VERSION, DIEM AND NHU, SHOULD HAVE BEEN SENT ABROAD BY PLANE ; BUT,

INSTEAD, THEY ESCAPED FROM THE PALACE, WERE FOUND N THE CHOLON CHURCH

BY A TROOP OF SOLDIERS WHO ARRESTED THE PAIR AND DROVE THEM OFF IN AN

ARMORED CAR TOWARD MILITARY HEADQUARTERS . ON THE WAY, AN ORDER WAS

GIVEN TO KILL THEM . WHEN THE ARMORED CAR ARRIVED AT HEADQUARTERS, BOTH

MEN WERE DEAD . " UNOFFICIAL " PHOTOGRAPHS SHOWED DIEM'S BULLET-RIDDLED

BODY LYING NEXT TO A PERSONNEL CARRIER, WITH A SOLDIER LEANING OVER HIM

. A PICTURE OF NHU SHOWED HIM ON A STRETCHER, HIS BODY MARKED BY

BRUISES . ACCORDING TO THE SAME REPORT, HE HAD BEEN STABBED TO DEATH .

AGAIN THE ACCUSING VOICE OF MME . NHU WAS HEARD FROM LOS ANGELES : "

ANY CRIME COMMITTED AGAINST THE NGO FAMILY CANNOT BE HIDDEN UNDER THE

LABEL OF SUICIDE . I AFFIRM THAT SUICIDE HAS ALWAYS BEEN CONSIDERED

INCOMPATIBLE WITH OUR RELIGION . " SHE ALSO WORRIED OVER THE FATE OF

HER THREE YOUNG CHILDREN, 4, 11 AND 15, BUT REPORTS FROM SAIGON

SUGGESTED THAT THEY WERE SAFE . SHE ADDED AMID SOBS : " IF REALLY MY

FAMILY HAS BEEN TREACHEROUSLY KILLED WITH EITHER THE OFFICIAL OR

UNOFFICIAL BLESSING OF THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT, I CAN PREDICT TO YOU

ALL THAT THE STORY IN SOUTH VIET NAM IS ONLY AT ITS BEGINNING . " THE

TRUNG SISTERS . THE REPORTS OF DIEM'S MURDER THAT SWEPT THROUGH SAIGON

LEFT A COLD CHILL AMONG EVEN THE BITTEREST OF HIS ENEMIES . BUT FOR A

WHILE NOTHING COULD COOL THE EXULTANT CROWDS IN SAIGON . BUDDHIST

MONKS, QUICKLY RELEASED FROM JAIL BY THE REVOLUTIONARY REGIME, JOINED

THE THRONGS . SHOUTING STUDENTS TURNED THE TOWN ON END . THE MOB

SMASHED BOOKSTORES THAT HAD BEEN OWNED BY DIEM'S BROTHER, BISHOP NGO

DINH THUC, AND BY MADAME NHU . ANOTHER CROWD TOPPLED AND BROKE UP THE

STATUE OF VIET NAM'S REVEREND TRUNG SISTERS, STALWART VIETNAMESE

HEROINES WHO FOUGHT CHINESE OVERLORDS IN THE 1ST CENTURY A.D . ; THEIR

MONUMENT HAD BEEN SPONSORED BY MADAME NHU . AT THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, A

SHOUTING ANTI-DIEM CROWD SACKED THE HALL . THEN CARRIED DIEM'S PORTRAIT

ONTO THE FRONT STEPS AND SHREDDED IT . AT FIRST, THE SOLDIERS OF THE

MILITARY JUNTA LET THE EXCITEMENT RUN ITS COURSE, THEN TROOPS NUDGED

THE

MOBS OFF MAIN THOROUGHFARES, URGING THEM TO QUIET DOWN . THEY OBVIOUSLY

HAD ORDERS FROM THE NATION'S NEW BOSS,DUONG VAN MINH, TO AVOID THE KIND

OF TOUGH MEASURES THAT MIGHT MAKE ENEMIES FOR HIS REGIME .

ORIENTAL GULLIVER . EIGHT YEARS AGO, GENERAL

DUONG VAN MINH MADE A TRIUMPHAL ENTRY INTO SAIGON TO THE CHEERS OF HIS

COUNTRYMEN . MINH'S TROOPS HAD HUNTED DOWN THE LAST GUERRILLA FORCES OF

THE DREADED BINH XUYEN BANDITS, A SORT OF ORIENTAL COSA NOSTRA THAT

PILLAGED THE COUNTRYSIDE AND CONTROLLED VICE IN SAIGON . SOMETIMES IT

WAS KNOWN AS " THE WHOREHOUSE SECT . " SO MOVED WAS PRESIDENT NGO DINH

DIEM BY MINH'S VICTORY THAT HE KISSED HIS GENERAL ON BOTH CHEEKS . IF

SHEER HEFT COULD HELP HIM RUN SOUTH VIET NAM, BIG MINH WOULD HAVE NO

PROBLEM . A GULLIVER AMONG HIS COUNTRY'S LILLIPUTIANS, HE STANDS JUST

UNDER 6 FT . AND WEIGHS AROUND 200 LBS., HAS A PRONOUNCED SLOUCH CAUSED

FROM CONSTANTLY HAVING TO STOOP OVER TO HEAR HIS COUNTRYMEN . AMERICAN

MILITARY ADVISERS NICKNAMED HIM BIG TO DISTINGUISH HIM FROM A

SMALLER-STATURED FELLOW OFFICER WHO IS NOT RELATED TO HIM, LIEUT .

GENERAL TRAN VAN ( " LITTLE " ) MINH . VIETNAMESE GOOD-NATUREDLY CALL

MINH " BEO, " OR FAT BOY . PRISON TO PRISON . BORN IN MYTHO, 35 MILES

SOUTHWEST OF SAIGON, MINH GRADUATED FROM A LYCEE RUN BY THE FRENCH, IN

1940 ENLISTED IN THE FRENCH COLONIAL ARMY AND WAS COMMISSIONED A 2ND

LIEUTENANT . HE SPENT MOST OF WORLD WAR II SERVING UNDER A VICHY

COLONIAL ADMINISTRATION THAT DID THE BIDDING OF THE JAPANESE INVADERS .

BUT IN MARCH 1945, WHEN VICHY SURRENDERED THE FRENCH COLONY TO THE

JAPANESE OUTRIGHT, MINH JOINED A BAND OF DEFIANT, LOWER-ECHELON

SOLDIERS WHO ORGANIZED HEROIC BUT FUTILE RESISTANCE TO THE CAPITULATION

. MINH WAS TAKEN PRISONER BY THE JAPANESE, BEATEN AND TORTURED BY

HAVING MOST OF HIS TEETH YANKED OUT . MINH IS PROUD OF HIS DENTAL SCARS

AND TODAY, WHEN HE NEGLECTS TO WEAR HIS FALSE-TOOTH PLATE, HE SMILES

JUST THE SAME, UNINHIBITEDLY SHOWING OFF HIS HALF-EMPTY MOUTH .

RELEASED BY THE JAPANESE AFTER TWO MONTHS, MINH DULY REPORTED BACK TO

THE FRENCH ONLY TO BE JAILED FOR HIS INSURRECTION . HE AND SEVERAL

OTHER PRISONERS WERE PUT IN A CROWDED, REEKING CELL WITH NEITHER LIGHT

NOR TOILET, ANKLEDEEP IN HUMAN EXCREMENT . MINH " ALMOST WENT CRAZY, "

WAS FREED AFTER THREE MONTHS, THANKS TO A FELLOW PRISONER WHO WAS

RELEASED BEFORE MINH AND INTERVENED ON HIS BEHALF WITH THE FRENCH

COMMANDANT . THE FRIEND : NGUYEN NGOC THO, DIEM'S VICE PRESIDENT AND

THE MILITARY JUNTA'S CHOICE LAST WEEK FOR PREMIER . ALTHOUGH MINH IS

UNIVERSALLY DEEMED ANTI-COMMUNIST AND PRO-WEST, THE EXPERIENCE IN JAIL

HEIGHTENED HIS NATIONALISM . HOWEVER, AFTER HIS RELEASE, HE ACCEPTED A

PROMOTION TO 1ST LIEUTENANT IN THE FRENCH FORCES, SPENT FOUR YEARS

ATTACHED TO THE PUPPET REGIME OF EMPEROR BAO DAI .

IN 1952, WITH INDEPENDENCE ONLY TWO YEARS AWAY, MINH

TRANSFERRED TO THE NEWLY FORMED VIETNAMESE ARMY WITH THE GRADE OF MAJOR

. AFTER A STINT OF ADVANCED STUDY AT PARIS' GENERAL STAFF SCHOOL, HE

RETURNED AND, FOLLOWING DIEM'S INSTALLATION IN 1955, LAUNCHED HIS

GUERRILLA-STYLE CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE BINH XUYEN BANDITS . HE ALSO

HELPED DIEM IN HIS CAMPAIGN TO SUBDUE TWO FANATIC, REBELLIOUS RELIGIOUS

SECTS, THE HOA HAO AND CAO DAI . AFTER A SECOND TRAINING TOUR ABROAD

THIS ONE AT THE U.S . ARMY COMMAND AND GENERAL STAFF COLLEGE AT FORT

LEAVENWORTH, WHERE HE PICKED UP SERVICEABLE ENGLISH MINH IN 1958 WAS

CHOSEN BY DIEM TO BE THE FIRST BOSS OF A FIELD OPERATIONS COMMAND TO

COORDINATE THE MOUNTING WAR AGAINST COMMUNIST VIET CONG GUERRILLAS .

GENERALS WITHOUT COMMANDS . LIKE MANY OF HIS BROTHER OFFICERS, MINH WAS

TO BECOME DISENCHANTED WITH THE PRESIDENT'S RULE, WHICH OFTEN CUT

HUMILIATING THROUGH THEIR CHAINS OF COMMAND . ONCE, WITHOUT

SO MUCH AS ADVISING THE AREA COMMANDER, THE

PRESIDENT'S BROTHER, NGO DINH NHU, ORDERED AN ENTIRE BATTALION

TRANSFERRED 80 MILES FROM CANTHO TO SAIGON . MINH PROTESTED PRIVATELY

: " GENERALS DO NOT HAVE POWER OF COMMAND, THEREFORE I DO NOT COMMAND

. " HE WAS ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT LACK OF POPULAR SUPPORT IN THE WAR

AGAINST THE VIET CONG, BUT HE TOOK NO PART IN THE ABORTIVE 1960 COUP .

IN THE END, HOWEVER, MINH SUFFERED FOR HIS VIEWS, WHICH ULTIMATELY

REACHED THE PALACE . LAST YEAR, EVEN THOUGH MINH WAS BEING PUSHED

VIGOROUSLY BY GENERAL PAUL D . HARKINS, HIS FIELD OPERATIONS COMMAND

WAS ABOLISHED, AND MINH WAS ASSIGNED AS " MILITARY ADVISER " TO THE

PRESIDENT A MEANINGLESS POST IN WHICH HE WAS UNDER DIEM'S SURVEILLANCE

TALK WITH THE PENTAGON . THE DOWNGRADING FAILED

TO DIMINISH U.S . ENTHUSIASM FOR MINH, WHO IMPRESSED THEM NOT ONLY IN

MILITARY ABILITY . HE IS ONE OF HIS COUNTRY'S TOP ALL-ROUND ATHLETES,

EXCELS AT TENNIS, SOCCER, SWIMMING AND BOATING . MINH USED TO DELIGHT

IN RUNNING HIS 16-FT . MOTORBOAT UP AND DOWN THE SAIGON RIVER BY MEANS

OF A REMOTECONTROL STEERING SYSTEM, TERRORIZING ALL OTHER RIVER TRAFFIC

. ONE DAY, A FEW YEARS AGO, MINH WAS MATCHED AGAINST VISITING GENERAL

MAXWELL TAYLOR IN A SET OF TENNIS DOUBLES AND LATER EXULTED : " WE

WHIPPED THE HELL OUT OF THEM . " IN THE ANGRY AFTERMATH OF LAST

AUGUST'S " SPECIAL FORCES " RAIDS ON BUDDHIST PAGODAS, EYES FELL ON

MINH AS A MAN WHO MIGHT LEAD A COUP . KNOWING THAT HE WAS SUSPECT, MINH

TOOK CARE NOT TO IMPLICATE HIMSELF ; AS RECENTLY AS TWO WEEKS AGO, HE

SHOWED UP WITH DIEM AT A PALACE CEREMONY . BUT WITHIN THE PAST MONTH,

MINH PARTICIPATED IN AN AFTERNOON'S TALK WITH A VISITING PENTAGON

OFFICIAL IN WHICH THE POSSIBILITIES OF A COUP WERE DISCUSSED . THE FAT

BOY SUGGESTED THAT HE WAS NOT THE MAN TO LEAD IT, IF IT CAME, BECAUSE

HE CONSIDERS HIMSELF A WEAK ADMINISTRATOR . MINH EVIDENTLY FOUND HIS

ADMINISTRATOR IN ARISTOCRATIC, FRENCH-EDUCATED LIEUT . GENERAL TRAN VAN

DON, 46, ACTING CHIEF OF THE JOINT GENERAL STAFF, CO-LEADER OF THE

COUP, AND THE SHARPEST STAFF OFFICER IN SOUTH VIET NAM . SAYS ONE U.S .

OFFICER OF MINH : " HE IS A VERY NICE MAN AND VERY TOUGH, BUT GENERAL

DON IS MORE CAPABLE . " BIG MINH MAY LACK THE POLITICAL TALENT TO

BECOME THE LEADER HIS COUNTRY NEEDS, BUT HE HAS SEVERAL IMPORTANT

FACTORS GOING FOR HIM . FOR ONE THING, HE IS A CAREER INFANTRYMAN WITH

A BULLDOG FACE AND A TOP SERGEANT'S BLUNTNESS, YET IS POPULAR IN THE

RANKS . NEXT, HE IS CLEAN OF CORRUPTION OR A PRO-COMMUNIST PAST .

FINALLY, BIG MINH IS POPULAR AMONG CIVILIANS . HE DRINKS SO LITTLE THAT

ONE JOKE HAS IT THAT A QUART OF WHISKY WOULD LAST HIM A YEAR . HE IS

MARRIED TO A PRETTY VIETNAMESE WIFE, HAS THREE CHILDREN . HE IS A

BUDDHIST WHO ESCHEWS FANATICISM . SAID ONE VIETNAMESE LAST WEEK : "

EVERYONE KNOWS GENERAL MINH . HE FOUGHT THE WHOREHOUSE SECT . HE IS A

GOOD MAN . /

ITALY " THIS SHIP IS LEAKING " ITALIAN

DEMOCRACY LAST WEEK WAS STAGGERING TOWARD A POLITICAL CRISIS THAT MAY

WELL PROVE TO BE THE WORST SINCE THE COMMUNISTS WERE NARROWLY DEFEATED

15 YEARS AGO . ON THE VERGE OF ENTERING THE GOVERNMENT WAS A MARXIST

PARTY THAT, AT ITS WORST, IS OPENLY ALLIED WITH THE COMMUNISTS AND, AT

BEST, IS ONLY A LUKEWARM AND NEUTRALITY-MINDED ADHERENT OF THE WEST .

SEEKING PERMISSION . WHEN THE ORIGINAL APERTURA A SINISTRA (OPENING TO

THE LEFT) WAS ENGINEERED A LITTLE LESS THAN TWO YEARS AGO, IT HAPPENED

LARGELY BECAUSE THE LONG-RULING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS FELT THEMSELVES

SLIPPING AT THE POLLS AND GENERALLY DECLINING IN VIGOR COMPARED TO

THEIR EARLY POSTWAR DAYS . THE SOLUTION ADVANCED BY LEFT-WING CHRISTIAN

DEMOCRATS, WITH THE ZEALOUS BACKING OF WASHINGTON, WAS A SERIES OF

REFORMS IN EDUCATION, AGRICULTURE AND TAXATION, ALL INVOLVING LARGE

MEASURES OF GOVERNMENT PLANNING . SINCE THIS PROGRAM WAS OPPOSED BY THE

RIGHTIST PARTIES IN PARLIAMENT, INCLUDING THE FREE-ENTERPRISING

LIBERALS, THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS NEEDED SUPPORT ELSEWHERE TO BE ABLE

TO FORM A MAJORITY . THEY SOUGHT IT FROM PIETRO NENNI'S LEFT-WING

SOCIALISTS . ACCORDING TO THE APERTURA AGREEMENT, THE NENNI SOCIALISTS

DID NOT ENTER THE GOVERNMENT BUT SUPPORTED IT IN PARLIAMENT . IN THE

PROCESS, SOME CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS HOPED, THE NENNI SOCIALISTS WOULD BE

WOOED INTO BREAKING THEIR LONGSTANDING ALLIANCE WITH THE COMMUNISTS .

AS IT TURNED OUT, THE APERTURA FAILED TO ACCOMPLISH THAT OR ANYTHING

ELSE EXCEPT THE UNNECESSARY NATIONALIZATION OF ITALY'S ELECTRICAL

INDUSTRY .

IT ALSO PAVED THE WAY, AT LAST SPRING'S ELECTIONS, FOR HEAVY GAINS BY

BOTH THE COMMUNISTS AND THE LIBERALS . SINCE THEN ITALY HAS BEEN RULED

BY THE CARETAKER GOVERNMENT OF PREMIER GIOVANNI LEONE . BUT BOTH PIETRO

NENNI AND THE MAJORITY OF THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS UNDER ALDO MORO

WANTED TO REVIVE THE APERTURA, THIS TIME WITH THE LEFT-WING SOCIALISTS

ACTUALLY IN THE GOVERNMENT . LAST WEEK, PIETRO NENNI TURNED TO HIS

DEEPLY DIVIDED PARTY TO GET ITS PERMISSION TO NEGOTIATE SUCH A DEAL .

OUTSIDE ROME'S MASSIVE MARBLE PALACE OF THE CONGRESSES, 600 SOCIALIST

DELEGATES PARKED THEIR FIATS, LOOKING FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE BOURGEOIS

CONVENTIONEERS . BUT INSIDE, SUGGESTING THAT YOU CAN'T TEACH OLD

DOGMATISTS NEW TRICKS, THE STAGE WAS BEDECKED WITH RED FLAGS AND THE

SOCIALIST EMBLEM : A HAMMER, SICKLE AND A RISING SUN . EYES GREW MISTY

WITH TEARS AS THE AFFLUENT CROWD BROKE OUT IN EMOTIONAL RENDITIONS OF

THE INTERNATIONALE AND BANDIERA ROSSA (RED FLAG) . SPOUTING JARGON .

TODAY, SAID PIETRO NENNI FRANKLY, " SOCIALIST PARTICIPATION IN A

COALITION GOVERNMENT IS NOT A QUESTION OF PRINCIPLE BUT OF POLITICAL

OPPORTUNITY . " THEN HE LAUNCHED INTO A PRECARIOUS BALANCING ACT . HE

DENOUNCED THE COMMUNISTS' " ARID THEORIES OF POWER, " AND URGED THE

PARTY TO DROP ITS RULE DEMANDING COOPERATION WITH THE REDS IN LOCAL

ELECTIONS . BUT HE DID NOT AS THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS HAD WANTED HIM TO

ASK THAT SUCH ELECTORAL ALLIANCES BE SPECIFICALLY RULED OUT . IN

FOREIGN AFFAIRS, NENNI ADVOCATED A VAGUE POLICY OF " POSITIVE

NEUTRALISM, " WHICH MEANS UNENTHUSIASTIC ADHERENCE TO NATO AND

OPPOSITION TO THE U.S . PLAN FOR A MULTINATIONAL SURFACE FLEET EQUIPPED

WITH POLARIS MISSILES .

THE POWERFUL PRO-COMMUNIST WING OF

NENNI'S SOCIALISTS DENOUNCED THE PROPOSED COALITION GOVERNMENT AS "

UNACCEPTABLE TO A WORKING-CLASS PARTY . " THE BALANCE OF POWER RESTED

WITH THE SOCIALISTS' NO . 2 LEADER, RICCARDO LOMBARDI, WHO ONLY JOINED

THE PARTY IN 1947 (BEFORE THEN HE WAS A LEADER OF THE LEFTIST ACTION

PARTY, WHICH DIED IN 1946) AND FEVERISHLY TRIES TO MAKE UP FOR LOST

TIME BY SPOUTING ARCHAIC MARXIST JARGON . HE ALSO MADE NEUTRALIST

NOISES, AND UNLIKE NENNI, HE HINTED AT FURTHER NATIONALIZATION SCHEMES

. STILL, WHILE HE DENOUNCED THE " MENACE OF CAPITALISM, " LOMBARDI

ADMITTED THAT WITHIN A DECADE THE CAPITALISTS MIGHT SOLVE ITALY'S

SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS SO THE SOCIALISTS HAD BETTER GET INTO THE

GOVERNMENT NOW TO SHARE

THE CREDIT AND INFLUENCE EVENTS . THUS, IN THE END, LOMBARDI THREW HIS

SUPPORT TO NENNI, BUT WITH SO MANY QUALIFICATIONS THAT NENNI MIGHT YET

FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO WORK OUT A COALITION WITH THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS

. OF 101 SEATS IN THE PARTY'S CENTRAL COMMITTEE, TWO WENT TO

INDEPENDENTS, 49 TO PROCOMMUNISTS AND 59 TO DELEGATES FAVORING THE

COALITION . OF THESE 59, HOWEVER, 16 ARE HELD BY LOMBARDI SUPPORTERS .

VIEWING HIS SHAKY VICTORY, THE AGING (72), AILING NENNI DECLARED : "

THIS SHIP IS LEAKING ON ALL SIDES . " MORE MODERATE ? RIGHT-WING

CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS, WHO HAD OPPOSED THE APERTURA IN THE FIRST PLACE,

WARNED DIRELY AGAINST TAKING THE SOCIALISTS ON BOARD AT ALL . SAID

LIBERAL LEADER GIOVANNI MALAGODI : " COLLABORATION WITH THE SOCIALISTS

SIGNIFIES THE ABANDONMENT OF THE STRUGGLE AGAINST COMMUNISM,

ABANDONMENT OF SOLIDARITY WITH THE WEST, ABANDONMENT OF A FREE ECONOMY

AND AN OPEN DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY . " U.S . POLICYMAKERS, ALTHOUGH THEY NO

LONGER SUPPORT THE APERTURA WITH THE SAME OLD ENTHUSIASM, PERCEIVE NO

SUCH PERILS ; THEY ARGUE THAT NENNI & CO . WOULD BECOME MORE MODERATE

AS MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT THAN IF THEY REMAINED ON THE OUTSIDE

LOOKING IN . BESIDES, INSIST DEFENDERS OF THE APERTURA, THE ALTERNATIVE

TO A CENTER-LEFT ALLIANCE IS A CENTER-RIGHT COALITION WHICH COULD NOT

COMMAND A MAJORITY IN THE PRESENT PARLIAMENT WITHOUT THE VOTES OF

MONARCHISTS AND NEO-FASCISTS . MANY ITALIAN RIGHT-WINGERS ACTUALLY WANT

THE APERTURA GOVERNMENT FORMED, HOPING THAT IT WILL FAIL, THEREBY

FORCING NEW ELECTIONS IN WHICH THE RIGHT-WING PARTIES EXPECT TO MAKE

FURTHER GAINS FOR COMRADE PALMIRO TOGLIATTI, HE CHIDED NENNI FOR HIS

ANTI-COMMUNIST TALK AND SWEETLY URGED BOTH THE SOCIALISTS AND THE

LEFT-WING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS TO ACCEPT COOPERATION WITH THE COMMUNIST

PARTY .

JANUARY, DAHOMEY'S PRESIDENT HUBERT MAGA EXCITEDLY TELEPHONED MILITARY

HEADQUARTERS TO REPORT THAT HIS RESIDENCE WAS BEING SHELLED . HE SOON

WENT BACK TO SLEEP . AS IT TURNED OUT, THE TOUGH, JOLLY, FORMER

SCHOOLTEACHER HAD BEEN AROUSED BY THE CLATTER OF WINDBLOWN COCONUTS

PELTING DOWN ON THE MANSION'S TIN ROOF . LAST WEEK THE SOUNDS IN THE

NIGHT CAME FROM REAL GUNFIRE AS ANGRY MOBS SWEPT THROUGH THE FORMER

FRENCH WEST AFRICA COLONY, LOCATED BETWEEN TOGO AND NIGERIA ON THE GULF

OF GUINEA . IN COTONOU, THE CAPITAL, AND NEARBY PORTONOVO, THE RAGGED

CROWDS CARRIED BLACKDRAPED COFFINS AND CHANTED WAR SONGS AS THEY

RANSACKED GOVERNMENT OFFICES, BURNED CARS, HAULED DOWN THE GREEN,

YELLOW AND RED NATIONAL FLAG FROM PUBLIC BUILDINGS, AND DEMANDED MAGA'S

OUSTER . BARIBA TRIBESMEN FROM MAGA'S NATIVE NORTHERN REGION LEAPED

INTO THE FRAY IN HIS DEFENSE AND KILLED TWO DEMONSTRATORS WITH BOWS AND

ARROWS . FINALLY THE PRESIDENT RESIGNED IN FAVOR OF COLONEL CHRISTOPHE

SOGLO, COMMANDER OF DAHOMEY'S 800-MAN ARMY, WHO BECAME HEAD OF STATE

AND PROMPTLY SUSPENDED THE CONSTITUTION .

SQUANDERMANIA . IT WAS

THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF COUPS THAT HAVE SHAKEN AFRICA'S NEW NATIONS,

INCLUDING DAHOMEY'S NEIGHBOR, TOGO, WHERE PRESIDENT SYLVANUS OLYMPIO

WAS ASSASSINATED LAST JANUARY, AND THE FORMER FRENCH CONGO, WHOSE

PRESIDENT FULBERT YOULOU WAS DEPOSED IN AUGUST (THE EX-BELGIAN CONGO

ALSO WITNESSED A NEAR-COUP THREE WEEKS AGO) . PLOTS HAVE BEEN UNCOVERED

IN SENEGAL, CHAD AND THE IVORY COAST .

THE SOURCES OF TROUBLE

ARE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME IN ALL THE COUNTRIES INVOLVED : MORIBUND

ECONOMIES, VAST NUMBERS OF UNEMPLOYED, STRONG AND HOSTILE LABOR UNIONS

. IN DAHOMEY (POP . 2,200,000), THE SITUATION IS AGGRAVATED BY THE FACT

THAT IT ONCE SUPPLIED CIVIL SERVANTS FOR MANY OTHER FRENCH COLONIES AND

BOASTED THAT " BRAINS ARE OUR BIGGEST EXPORT " ; NOW IT HAS AN

INCREASINGLY SERIOUS WHITE-COLLAR UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEM, FOR NEWLY

INDEPENDENT WEST AFRICAN NATIONS TRAINED THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS

BALANCE HIS GOVERNMENT BETWEEN THE UNIONS, WHICH STILL HOWL FOR MAGA'S

COMPLETE REMOVAL, AND THE NORTHERN BARIBA TRIBESMEN, WHO ARE ON THE

WARPATH TO WIN MAGA'S COMPLETE REINSTATEMENT . THOUGH MASSIVE FRENCH

AID HELPED THE NEW NATIONS IN THE AREA TO ACHIEVE A MEASURE OF ECONOMIC

PROGRESS AND POLITICAL STABILITY, DAHOMEY AND THE OTHER FRENCH COLONIES

REINFORCEMENTS WOULD ALL HAVE BEEN BROUGHT BACK AFTER THE CRISIS EASED

ADDITIONAL REGIMENTS THAT ARE NOT COMMITTED TO NATO WOULD REMAIN ON

GREAT BRITAIN HOME IN THE HIGHLANDS FOR THE HIGHLAND VILLAGERS

OF PERTHSHIRE, BRITAIN'S PRIME MINISTER LAST WEEK PUT ON THE LIVELIEST

SHOW SINCE BONNIE PRINCE CHARLIE BATTLED THROUGH THEIR MISTY GLENS IN

1745 . IN DALGUISE AND DUNKELD, AMULREE AND BUCHANTY, AND SCORES OF

OTHER GREY HAMLETS AND MARKET TOWNS, SIR ALEC DOUGLAS-HOME SHOOK HANDS

WITH SHEPHERDS AND SHOPKEEPERS, DOWNED A WEE DRAPPIE WITH FARMERS,

POPPED INTO COTTAGES, SCHOOLS AND SMITHIES . THE PRIME MINISTER EVEN

TOOK A NOBLE PRATFALL IN THE MUD AS HE WAS SCRAMBLING UP A HAYCART TO

ADDRESS THE FOLK IN SLEEPY DUNNING . " WELL, " HE GRINNED, GETTING TO

HIS FEET, " IT'S BETTER TO FALL NOW THAN LATER . " ON THE STUMP,

DOUGLAS-HOME SEEMED RELAXED AND SLIP-PROOF . TO WIN ELECTION TO

PARLIAMENT FROM THE SAFE TORY SEAT, HE RACED THROUGH THE GLENS IN A

FAST BLACK HUMBER, MAKING DOZENS OF PLAIN-SPOKEN SPEECHES ON TOPICS

RANGING FROM WINTER GRAIN PRICES TO EAST-WEST RELATIONS . WEARING A

BATTERED TWEED JACKET AND A JAUNTILY ANGLED CHECKED-CLOTH CAP, HE

FIELDED INVOLVED LOCAL QUESTIONS WITH A BARRAGE OF STATISTICS THAT

SHOWED HE HAD DONE HIS HOMEWORK IN THE HILLSIDE COTTAGE NEAR COMRIE

THAT BECAME THE OFFICIAL SEAT OF GOVERNMENT DURING THE CAMPAIGN . WHEN

HECKLING STIRRED AN UPROAR IN THE CROWD HE WAS ADDRESSING AT ABERFELDY,

THE PRIME MINISTER CALMLY SAT DOWN IN MIDSPEECH, REFUSING TO LET PARTY

STEWARDS THROW OUT THE INTERRUPTERS . SAID HE : " THEY ARE HARMLESS

EUROPE THE WAYWARD BUSS IN COMMUNIST EAST

EUROPE, COMMISSARS AND COPS DO IT . IN ROME AND MADRID, MOPPETS IN

DANCING CLASS DO IT . FRENCHMEN PERFORM THE RITUAL WITH SINUOUS GRACE,

SPANIARDS SMACKINGLY, GERMANS WITH A CLICK OF THE HEELS . HOWEVER

WIDELY THEIR TECHNIQUES MAY VARY, EUROPEANS FROM BARCELONA TO BIALYSTOK

IN RECENT YEARS HAVE TAKEN TO HAND KISSING WITH FERVOR AND FREQUENCY

UNMATCHED IN THEIR HISTORY . AFTER WORLD WAR II, THE CUSTOM SEEMED IN

DECLINE . BUT TODAY, MEN OF VIRTUALLY EVERY CLASS AND CALLING ON THE

CONTINENT DIVE FOR DISTAFF KNUCKLES AS ASSIDUOUSLY, IF NOT ALWAYS SO

EXPERTLY, AS DO THE COURTIERS IN A LEHAR OPERETTA . TELEGRAPHED

ADMIRATION . TRADITIONALISTS DEPLORE THE TREND AND COMPLAIN THAT IT HAS

VULGARIZED A STYLISH, PATRICIAN RITUAL . IN THE OLD DAYS, NO WELL-BRED

EUROPEAN KISSED A WOMAN'S HAND BEFORE NOON, OR OUTDOORS (EXCEPT AT

GARDEN PARTIES OR THE RACE TRACK), OR IF SHE WORE GLOVES AND NOT AT

ALL, IN MOST COUNTRIES, IF SHE WAS UNMARRIED . NOWADAYS, EVEN IN

STRAIT-LACED SPAIN, GIRLS WHO ARE BARELY OLD ENOUGH TO HOLD UP A

STRAPLESS BRA HAVE THEIR HANDS OUT . WHEN IT IS ENCLOSED IN A GLOVE,

UNINHIBITED MALES BLITHELY PEEL IT OFF OR SMOOCH THE WRIST INSTEAD .

AND NOW THAT THE HAND KISS HAS BECOME DEMOCRATIC, IT IS BESTOWED

ALFRESCO, ANY TIME, ANY PLACE, EVEN WHEN THE RECIPIENT IS ON HORSEBACK

OR IN CHURCH . NOTWITHSTANDING THE CELEBRATED ADVICE OF LORELEI LEE ( "

A KISS ON THE HAND MAY BE QUITE CONTINENTAL, BUT DIAMONDS ARE A GIRL'S

BEST FRIEND " ), MOST EUROPEAN WOMEN WELCOME THE NEW WAVE OF HAND

KISSING, AND TO THEIR MEN IT HAS ALWAYS SEEMED A MORE INTRIGUING

APPROACH TO A WOMAN THAN THE ASEPTIC ANGLO-SAXON HANDSHAKE . AS A

VIENNESE SATIRIST WROTE IN 1825 : TO TAKE YOUR HAND FOR

A KISS IS MERELY TO ASK THIS : WILL THE MOUTH OF THE MISS PERMIT

FURTHER BLISS ? TO SPEED THE ANSWER, ARDENT LATINS, IN

PARTICULAR, SOMETIMES TELEGRAPH THEIR ADMIRATION FOR AN ATTRACTIVE

WOMAN BY SQUEEZING HER FINGERS OR LOCKING ON TO THEM WITH BOTH HANDS

ALL, CRACKS ITALIAN MOVIEMAKER VITTORIO DE SICA : " YOU'VE GOT TO

START SOMEWHERE . " CAPITALIST HANGOVER . HAND KISSING GOT ITS START IN

EUROPE WITH THE ROMAN EMPERORS, WHO EXPORTED THE GESTURE AS A SYMBOLIC

ACT OF FEALTY . IN CENTRAL EUROPE IT CEASED TO BE A PLEDGE OF LOYALTY

TO THE SOVEREIGN IN THE LATE 18TH CENTURY, WHEN AUSTRIAN EMPEROR JOSEPH

II SNATCHED HIS HAND FROM SUBJECTS' LIPS WITH THE CRY : " IT ISN'T

THERE FOR SOMEONE TO WIPE HIS NOSE ON ! " MORE RECENTLY MUSSOLINI,

WHO FROWNED ON THE CUSTOM IN ANY FORM, TRIED TO DISCOURAGE IL BACIAMANO

. HE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE TRIED TO SUPPRESS SPAGHETTI . THE NAZIS ALSO

DEPLORED THE HANDKUSS GOOD GERMANS WERE MEANT TO GIVE THE HITLER SALUTE

INSTEAD BUT DER FUHRER HIMSELF WAS OFTEN PHOTOGRAPHED WITH HIS FORELOCK

FANNING SOME ACTRESS'S PAW . IN EASTERN EUROPE AFTER WORLD WAR II, THE

COMMUNISTS DENOUNCED THE PRACTICE AS A " CAPITALIST HANGOVER, " BUT

THEY SOON DESPAIRED OF CURING IT . AFTER HUNGARIAN MALES, WHO HAVE BEEN

KNOWN TO FEAST ON A PRETTY FINGER FOR SEEMING MINUTES IN A DIPLOMATIC

RECEIVING LINE, POLAND BOASTS THE IRON CURTAIN'S MOST INSATIABLE HAND

KISSERS ; WARSAW POLICEMEN ROUTINELY KISS POLICEWOMEN'S HANDS, AND

HAVE EVEN BEEN KNOWN TO BUSS A COMELY SPEEDER AFTER HANDING HER A

TICKET . ITALY'S COMMUNIST BOSS PALMIRO TOGLIATTI IS AN ACCOMPLISHED

FINGER-SMOOCHER . AS FOR RUSSIA, TSELOVAT RUKU WAS OUTLAWED BY THE

COMMISSARIAT OF HYGIENE IN 1924, BUT TODAY IT IS CONSIDERED SO KULTURNY

THAT AN ANNOUNCER WHO RECENTLY NUZZLED A FRENCH ACTRESS'S HAND ON

SOVIET TELEVISION DID NOT EVEN RAISE PRAVDA'S TEMPERATURE .

COLD WAR NIKITA & THE CAPITALISTS HE CALLED

THEM " GENTLEMEN CAPITALISTS, " AND ONLY OCCASIONALLY SUGGESTED THAT

ALL CAPITALISTS ARE REALLY ROBBERS AND CHEATS . COMMUNIST DELEGATIONS

FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD CROWDED INTO MOSCOW FOR THE 46TH ANNIVERSARY

CELEBRATIONS OF THE BOLSHEVIK REVOLUTION . BUT NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV

DEVOTED A TOTAL OF SEVEN HOURS TO A TRAVELING GROUP OF 20 TOP AMERICAN

EXECUTIVES (PLUS ONE EDUCATOR) AS IF HE FOUND MORE CHALLENGE IN THEIR

COMPANY . ON A EUROPEAN TOUR SPONSORED BY TIME, THE VISITORS FIRST

CALLED ON K . AT THE KREMLIN . IN THE OVAL ROOM, WHERE THE SOVIET

COUNCIL OF MINISTERS USUALLY MEETS, THE CALLERS SAT IN ROWS OF SMALL

DESKS WHILE HE ANSWERED QUESTIONS FROM BEHIND A HUGE BARRICADE OF A

TABLE . HE ASKED THEM TO DROP IN AT HIS ANNIVERSARY RECEPTION THE

FOLLOWING DAY, AND THEY IN TURN ASKED HIM TO A PARTY OF THEIR OWN (HE

PROMPTLY ACCEPTED) . THROUGHOUT, KHRUSHCHEV PUT ON ONE OF THOSE

MARATHON PROPAGANDA PERFORMANCES AT WHICH HE IS BY TURNS HEARTY,

EARTHY, FUNNY, MENACING, SEEMINGLY FRANK, AND TOTALLY IMPERVIOUS TO

ARGUMENT . HE SOUNDED HIS USUAL NOTE OF RITUALISTIC OPTIMISM, VOWED

THAT IN SEVEN YEARS NO MORE AND NO LESS RUSSIA WILL OVERTAKE THE U.S .

ECONOMICALLY . TO HENRY R . ROBERTS, PRESIDENT OF CONNECTICUT GENERAL

LIFE, " HE ACTED LIKE A CORPORATION PRESIDENT WHO IS IN TROUBLE WITH

HIS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND IS TRYING TO GET OUT OF HIS DILEMMA BY

MAKING AGGRESSIVE AND BOASTFUL STATEMENTS . " MURDER AT THE WALL .

APART FROM CLAIMING VICTORY IN LAST WEEK'S BERLIN INCIDENT AND

DEPLORING THE DIFFICULTIES ON THE WHEAT DEAL (SEE THE NATION),

KHRUSHCHEV SUGGESTED THAT RUSSIA HAD NOT REALLY GIVEN UP ON THE MOON

RACE, AT LEAST NOT FOR THE LONG RUN, AND HE ALMOST TEASINGLY HINTED

THAT THE SINO-SOVIET SPLIT MIGHT BE MENDED ONE OF THESE DAYS : " THE

MORE YOU REJOICE ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES, THE GREATER YOUR DISAPPOINTMENT

WILL BE . " AGAIN AND AGAIN HE MADE A PITCH FOR TRADE WITH THE U.S.,

REPEATEDLY POINTED OUT THAT THE U.S.'S ALLIES TRADE FAR MORE HEAVILY

WITH RUSSIA THAN THE U.S . ITSELF . ACTUALLY, AS THESE BUSINESSMEN WELL

KNEW, RUSSIA HAS FEW GOLD RESERVES TO PAY FOR U.S . PRODUCTS AND LITTLE

IN THE WAY OF EXPORTABLE GOODS THAT MIGHT INTEREST THE U.S . WHEN

NATIONAL CASH REGISTER PRESIDENT ROBERT S . OELMAN ASKED WHAT PRODUCTS

RUSSIA COULD OFFER, KHRUSHCHEV CITED U.S . TRADE IN MACHINE TOOLS WITH

WEST GERMANY . " IF WE HAVE MANAGED TO BUILD A ROCKET NO WORSE THAN

ANYTHING YOU HAVE IN THE U.S., THEN I AM SURE WE WILL BE ABLE TO BUILD

MACHINE TOOLS IN NO WAY INFERIOR TO ANYTHING THE WEST GERMANS CAN BUILD

. " MOVING FROM FOREIGN TRADE TO FOREIGN RELATIONS, KHRUSHCHEV PULLED

OUT ALL THE " PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE " CLICHES, LOST HIS APLOMB (BUT NOT

HIS TEMPER) ONLY WHEN CHAUNCEY W . COOK, PRESIDENT OF GENERAL FOODS,

ASKED " WHY IS IT NECESSARY TO BUILD A BERLIN WALL AND SHOOT PEOPLE

DOWN IF THEY TRY TO GET OVER ? " / A STATE FRONTIER IS A STATE

FRONTIER, " KHRUSHCHEV REPLIED . " AND EVERY STATE, WHENEVER ITS

BORDERS ARE VIOLATED, SHOOTS THE VIOLATORS . " / NOT TO KEEP PEOPLE IN,

WE DON'T, " SNAPPED COOK . " IN YOUR COUNTRY, CHILDREN ARE KILLED IN A

CHURCH FOR THE SOLE REASON THAT THEIR COLOR IS DIFFERENT, " K . SNAPPED

BACK . BEFORE ANYONE COULD MAKE THE OBVIOUS RETORT THAT MURDER AT THE

WALL, UNLIKE MURDER IN BIRMINGHAM, IS AN ACT OF THE GOVERNMENT

KHRUSHCHEV WAS OFF ON SOMETHING ELSE

A NEW WAY TO CHEAT . LOOSENING UP AS

IT PROGRESSED, THE INTERVIEW CLOSED IN AN EXCHANGE OF BANTER, WITH

KHRUSHCHEV MAINTAINING THAT CAPITALISTS CONTROLLED THE U.S . GOVERNMENT

. " WHO WAS MCNAMARA BEFORE HE BECAME SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ? " ASKED

NIKITA . " HE WAS PRESIDENT OF FORD MOTOR, " ANSWERED G . KEITH

FUNSTON, PRESIDENT OF THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE . " HE'S ONE OUT OF

TEN IN THE CABINET . WHY NOT TALK ABOUT THE OTHERS ? " / WHAT WAS THE

OCCUPATION OF YOUR FORMER COMMANDER IN GERMANY ? " DEMANDED K . "

GENERAL CLAY IS NOW WITH LEHMAN BROTHERS, " SAID AVCO BOARD CHAIRMAN

KENDRICK R . WILSON JR . " HE'S AN ARMY OFFICER WHO MADE GOOD, " ADDED

FUNSTON . KHRUSHCHEV RAISED A PIOUS EYEBROW : " YOU HAVE 190 MILLION

PEOPLE . WHY DON'T THEY ALL MAKE GOOD ? CERTAINLY THEY HAVE NOT

TRESPASSED AGAINST GOD . " TO WILSON'S ASSERTION THAT THE AMERICAN

PEOPLE, THROUGH THE STOCK MARKET, OWN MUCH OF U.S . BUSINESS,

KHRUSHCHEV LAUGHED . " CAPITALISTS ARE VERY ASTUTE TO HAVE THOUGHT THAT

UP, " HE SAID . " IT'S A NEW WAY TO CHEAT PEOPLE . " HE WENT ON TO

DESCRIBE THE " PARASITIC " STATE OF CAPITALISM, WHERE THE COUPON

CLIPPER " CAN LIVE A LIFE OF LUXURY, DRINKING, CAROUSING, OR CHANGING

WIVES, " THEN EASED OFF . " I'M YOUR HOST HERE, " HE CONCLUDED, " SO

PLEASE DON'T PUT ME IN THE POSITION OF GOING INTO EACH INDIVIDUAL HERE

AND ASKING WHERE HE DIRECTS HIS ACTIVITIES AND SO FORTH, HOW MANY WIVES

HE HAS . ONE OF YOUR FELLOW CAPITALISTS ROCKEFELLER IS LOSING IN

PRESTIGE BECAUSE OF THAT . " A SENSE OF FRUSTRATION . NEXT DAY, THE

JOVIAL MOOD CHANGED . AT THE TRADITIONAL RED SQUARE PARADE CELEBRATING

THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE REVOLUTION, THE RUSSIANS DISPLAYED A SQUADRON OF

FINNED, 50-FT.-LONG ROCKETS, WHICH THEY INSISTED WERE ANTI-MISSILE

MISSILES (THE BIRDS LOOKED MORE LIKE BEEFED-UP VERSIONS OF THE SOVIET

SA-2 ANTIAIRCRAFT MISSILE, AND WESTERN OBSERVERS THOUGHT THAT AT MOST

THEY COULD BE THE EQUIVALENT OF THE U.S . ARMY'S NIKE ZEUS) . AT THE

KREMLIN RECEPTION LATER, KHRUSHCHEV'S TOASTS WERE SO HEARTILY

ANTI-WESTERN THAT U.S . AMBASSADOR FOY KOHLER FINALLY ASKED : " WHERE

IS THE SPIRIT OF MOSCOW ? I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY TOASTS I COULD DRINK TO

. " BUT THAT EVENING, WALKING INTO THE BUSINESSMEN'S RECEPTION AT THE

HOTEL SOVIETSKAYA (WHICH HAD BEEN REFURBISHED AND RESTAFFED FOR THE

VISITORS), HE AGAIN WAS AT HIS MOST AMIABLE . SITTING AT A TABLE,

OBLIVIOUS TO THE MASSED DIPLOMATS AND NEWSMEN WHO WERE CROWDING IN TO

LISTEN, KHRUSHCHEV SIPPED " THREE-STAR " ARMENIAN BRANDY AS, ONE BY

ONE, THE AMERICANS WERE GUIDED OVER TO TALK TO HIM . LIKE THE MASTER

POLITICIAN HE IS, K . REMEMBERED NAMES, FACES AND BUSINESS SPECIALTIES

FROM THE DAY BEFORE, EVEN TOLD A PRETTY SECRETARY : " YOU WORE A BROWN

DRESS YESTERDAY . " HE JOKINGLY HIT UP RUDOLPH PETERSON, PRESIDENT OF

CALIFORNIA'S BANK OF AMERICA, FOR A $10 BILLION LOAN, WITH EUGENE

BEESLEY, PRESIDENT OF ELI LILLY & CO., KHRUSHCHEV CONTINUED A

DISCUSSION OF POSSIBLE U.S.-SOVIET EXCHANGES IN MEDICAL RESEARCH, AND

WHEN HE WAS REMINDED THAT A TEAM OF FOUR U.S . DOCTORS IS IN RUSSIA NOW

DOING JUST THAT, NIKITA NODDED . " GOOD, " HE SAID, " AND LET'S GIVE

THEM A LAXATIVE IF THEY DO BADLY . " HE EAGERLY DISCUSSED

FOOD-PROCESSING TECHNIQUES WITH GENERAL FOODS' COOK,

MAGNETO-HYDRODYNAMICS WITH AVCO'S WILSON, AND LIQUOR WITH SEAGRAM'S

EDGAR M . BRONFMAN ( " OUR VODKA IS BETTER THAN YOUR VODKA " ) . WHEN

STOCK EXCHANGE PRESIDENT FUNSTON TURNED UP AT THE TABLE, NIKITA

KHRUSHCHEV CHANTED, IN ENGLISH : " WALL STREET ! WALL STREET ! "

HE SEEMED TO REGARD THE BUSINESSMEN AS DOERS LIKE HIMSELF, AND ONCE

TOOK A LEFT-HANDED DIG AT COMMUNIST INEFFICIENCY : " CAPITALISTS KNOW

WHAT IS PROFITABLE ; CAPITALISTS ARE NOT SOVIET BUREAUCRATS . " OFTEN

KHRUSHCHEV RETURNED TO HIS THEME OF TRADE : " REMEMBER, PLEASE, THAT

YOU CAN ALWAYS MAKE A PROFIT DEALING WITH US . " BUT THE QUESTION

REMAINED : A PROFIT FOR WHOM ? WALL STREET'S FUNSTON, FOR ONE,

CONCLUDED THAT THE U.S . SHOULD NOT TRADE WITH RUSSIA, SHOULD DO

NOTHING TO MAKE LIFE EASIER FOR THEM . SAID HE, IN WEST BERLIN : " I

U.S . CONSULATE, ONLY TO BE TURNED OUT AFTER THE STATE DEPARTMENT

RECEIVED ASSURANCES THAT THE GENERALS WOULD ALLOW HIM " DUE PROCESS OF

THOSE OF DIEM AND HIS BROTHER, NGO DINH NHU . THE OFFICIAL TALK OF

SUICIDE WAS OBVIOUSLY PHONY (SEE FOLLOWING STORY) . AT THE BEGINNING,

THE GENERALS APPARENTLY TRIED TO SPARE THE BROTHERS' LIVES, BUT AFTER

DIEM ESCAPED FROM THE PALACE, THE JUNTA EVIDENTLY FELL BACK ON THE

PHILOSOPHY OF 19TH CENTURY BRITISH POET ARTHUR HUGH CLOUGH : THOU

SHALT NOT KILL ; BUT NEED'ST NOT STRIVE OFFICIOUSLY TO KEEP ALIVE .

DIEM'S ELDEST

BROTHER, NGO DINH THUC, 66, ROMAN CATHOLIC ARCHBISHOP OF HUE, WAS IN

ROME ATTENDING THE ECUMENICAL COUNCIL . ANOTHER BROTHER, NGO DINH

LIVING, THERE REMAINED THE TASK OF PUTTING TOGETHER A GOVERNMENT .

PREMIER NGUYEN NGOC THO, DIEM'S LONGTIME VICE PRESIDENT, APPOINTED NINE

CIVILIAN MINISTERS MOSTLY NONPOLITICAL CIVIL SERVANTS IN THE OLD REGIME

. TO COUNSEL THO'S GOVERNMENT, THE BRASS NAMED A 15-MAN " COUNCIL OF

MILITARY THAT IS RUNNING THE COUNTRY . LIEUT . GENERAL TRAN VAN DON,

INSTITUTIONS HAVE BEEN SET UP, " THE REBELS WILL " TRANSFER ALL THE

POWERS BACK TO OUR ENTIRE PEOPLE, " HINTED AT ELECTIONS WITHIN A YEAR .

IN THE MEANTIME, AS MANY POLITICAL SHADES AS POSSIBLE WILL BE

REPRESENTED IN THE NEW GOVERNMENT, BUT, SAID DEFENSE MINISTER DON, " WE

DON'T WANT ANY NEUTRALISTS . " BEFORE THE WEEK WAS OUT, THE REGIME

LIFTED MARTIAL LAW AND CENSORSHIP . FIRST TO RECOGNIZE SOUTH VIET NAM'S

NEW GOVERNMENT WERE MALAYSIA AND THAILAND, FOLLOWED BY GREAT BRITAIN

AND THE U.S., WHICH ALSO PREPARED TO RESTORE A $12 MILLION-A-MONTH

IMPORT AID PROGRAM SUSPENDED UNDER DIEM . FOUR TIGERS . THE MOST

SERIOUS DANGER TO THE NEW GOVERNMENT IS POTENTIAL RIVALRY AMONG THE

GENERALS . THE FIRST HINTS OF THIS WERE ALREADY APPEARING AS LITTLE

MAJOR GENERAL TON THAT DINH INJECTED HIMSELF INTO THE LIMELIGHT WITH

AMAZING SPEED . IN THE FIRST WEEK OF VICTORY, SECURITY MINISTER DINH

CONDUCTED SEVERAL PRESS CONFERENCES OF HIS OWN, AND DURING ONE

INTERVIEW, WHILE PROTESTING THAT " WE MUST STAY AS ONE, " DINH

INSINUATED THAT BIG MINH WAS REALLY ONLY HIS " FRONT MAN . " BUT THE

U.S . IS BETTING THAT, FOR AT LEAST HALF A YEAR OR SO, THE GENERALS

WILL STAND TOGETHER, AND THERE ARE HIGH HOPES FOR A MORE VIGOROUS, MORE

EFFICIENT PURSUIT OF THE WAR AGAINST THE COMMUNISTS, WITH MORE AUTONOMY

FOR LOCAL COMMANDERS THAN ALLOWED BY DIEM . SAID BIG MINH : " OUR MAIN

PROBLEM IS TO MAKE THE POPULATION HAPPY . THIS AND THE MILITARY PROBLEM

ARE INTERTWINED . IF THE POPULATION DOES NOT FEEL PROTECTED, IT WILL GO

OVER TO THE VIET CONG . " IN THE WAR, THE COMMUNIST VIET CONG STEPPED

UP PROBING ACTIONS, BUT BIG MINH & CO . ORDERED A NEW CORPS COMMANDER

INTO THE MEKONG DELTA, ALSO REPLACED THREE DIVISION CHIEFS . SAID ONE

PLEASED AMERICAN ADVISER : " THEY ARE PUTTING SOME YOUNG TIGERS OUT

WITH DIEM IN SAIGON ON THE DAY SET FOR THE COUP, A VISIT SCHEDULED AT

LEAST A MONTH PREVIOUSLY . HE AND U.S . AMBASSADOR HENRY CABOT LODGE

STEPPED INTO DIEM'S OFFICE AT 10 A.M., APPARENTLY UNAWARE THAT HALF AN

HOUR BEFORE KEY TROOPS HAD BEGUN MOVING INTO POSITION FOR THE COUP .

THEY STAYED WITH DIEM UNTIL WELL PAST 11 A.M . AS LODGE, WHO WAS TO

LEAVE FOR WASHINGTON THE FOLLOWING DAY, TOOK HIS FINAL DEPARTURE, DIEM

REMARKED : " EVERY TIME THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR GOES AWAY, THEY TRY TO

PULL A COUP . " GENERAL DON SAW ADMIRAL FELT OFF AT THE AIRPORT A

LITTLE ANXIOUSLY, FOR THE AIRPORT ITSELF WAS SCHEDULED TO BE SEIZED IN

JUST 90 MINUTES . DON THEN WENT ON TO THE GENERALS' LUNCH . AT 1 : 30

P.M . SHARP, THE INSURGENT FORCE STRUCK, WITH RED-KERCHIEFED GENERAL

DINH BARKING THE ORDERS . DON WAS ASSIGNED TO KEEP LODGE INFORMED,

WHILE BIG MINH SUPERVISED THE WHOLE SHOW . THE GENERALS DELIBERATELY

KEPT PHONE LINES OPEN TO THE PALACE AND TO THE U.S . EMBASSY . THE

PALACE SWITCHBOARD (SAIGON 21584) AND PARTICULARLY DIEM'S DIRECT LINE

(23126) BUZZED WITH TELEPHONIC FRUSTRATION . WITH THE GUARD BARRACKS

AND THE PALACE BOTH UNDER SIEGE, DIEM AT 4 : 30 P.M . CALLED LODGE TO

ASK FOR U.S . HELP AGAINST THE INSURGENTS . LODGE REPLIED : " I'M

CONCERNED FOR YOUR SAFETY, " ASKED IF DIEM AND HIS BROTHER WOULD TAKE

ADVANTAGE OF THE INSURGENTS' OFFER OF SAFE-CONDUCT OUT OF VIET NAM . "

I SHALL DO WHAT DUTY AND GOOD SENSE INDICATE MUST BE DONE, " DIEM

REPLIED STIFFLY . " I SHALL TRY TO RESTORE ORDER . " HE HUNG UP . AT

CHURCH . HALF AN HOUR LATER, THE INSURGENT GENERALS CALLED DIEM TO THE

PHONE . ONE BY ONE, IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES, THEY ASKED HIM TO RESIGN

AND SURRENDER . FINALLY, BIG MINH DELIVERED AN ULTIMATUM : " GIVE UP

IN FIVE MINUTES OR THE PALACE WILL BE BOMBED . " DIEM STOOD FIRM, AND

THE GENERALS, STILL RELUCTANT AT THAT POINT TO RISK KILLING HIM, HELD

THEIR FINAL BLOW . AT 8 : 13 P.M., DIEM AND NHU LEFT THE PALACE NOT

THROUGH ESCAPE TUNNELS, AS WIDELY RUMORED . THEY SIMPLY WALKED OUT,

EACH WITH AN AIDE, AND GOT INTO INCONSPICUOUS SEDANS . AT THAT POINT

THE REBELS HAD NOT YET SEALED OFF THE PALACE, WERE STILL PASSING

CIVILIANS WHO LIVED ON THE GROUNDS, AND SO THE BROTHERS MANAGED TO

DRIVE THROUGH UNNOTICED . THEY RENDEZVOUSED AT A VILLA IN SUBURBAN

CHOLON OWNED BY BUSINESSMAN MA TUYEN, LEADER OF THE LOCAL CHINESE

COMMUNITY . DIEM AND NHU SPENT THEIR LAST NIGHT IN THE CHINESE

BUSINESSMAN'S VILLA, ACTUALLY TOOK CALLS THROUGH THE PALACE SWITCHBOARD

SO THAT THE INSURGENT GENERALS WOULD THINK THEY WERE STILL THERE . LATE

FRIDAY NIGHT OR EARLY SATURDAY, THE GENERALS CALLED AGAIN AND TOLD DIEM

THAT HIS LAST HOPE OF BEING RESCUED BY LOYAL TROOPS FROM OUTSIDE SAIGON

WAS GONE ; GENERAL HUYNH VAN CAO, COMMANDER OF IV CORPS IN THE MEKONG

DELTA AND THE LAST TO HOLD OUT, HAD COME OVER TO THE REBELS . WHEN DIEM

AGAIN REFUSED TO SURRENDER, THE REBEL GENERALS MOUNTED THE FINAL

ASSAULT . THE PALACE FELL, WITH NEITHER DIEM NOR NHU INSIDE . SATURDAY

MORNING, ALL SOULS' DAY, THE BROTHERS WENT TO CHOLON'S ST . FRANCIS

XAVIER CHURCH, ARRIVING AT 8 : 45 . THEY WALKED IN, KNELT AND TOOK

COMMUNION . THE JUNTA WAS TIPPED OFF BY AN INFORMER . MINUTES LATER AN

M-113 ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER ROARED UP TO THE CHURCH AND THE CAPTAIN

IN CHARGE ORDERED THE BROTHERS TO GET IN . AT HEADQUARTERS . SAIGON

STILL HUMS WITH RUMORS THAT DIEM AND NHU WERE ASSASSINATED IN THE

ARMORED CAR . ACCORDING TO THE NEW GOVERNMENT, WHICH HAS DISCARDED THE

ORIGINAL VERSION OF SUICIDE, NHU PROVOKED THE CAPTAIN BY INSULTING HIM,

AND IN AN ENSUING SCUFFLE OVER A GUN, BOTH BROTHERS WERE KILLED . THE

GOVERNMENT NOW CALLS THIS " ACCIDENTAL SUICIDE, " AND IT IS INTERESTING

TO SPECULATE WHAT U.S . REACTION WOULD HAVE BEEN IF DIEM HAD PUT OUT

SUCH A STORY ABOUT THE DEATH OF SOME PRISONERS OF HIS OWN . ACCORDING

TO THE MOST RELIABLE ACCOUNT, THE BROTHERS DIED QUITE DIFFERENTLY .

THEY WERE DRIVEN DIRECTLY TO JOINT GENERAL STAFF HEADQUARTERS, WHERE

THEY WERE TAKEN INTO A ROOM WITH " SEVERAL GENERALS . " DIEM WAS HANDED

A TAPERECORDER MICROPHONE AND TOLD TO MAKE A STATEMENT THAT HE WAS

RESIGNING THE PRESIDENCY . DIEM THREW THE MICROPHONE DOWN AND SAID : "

I WILL NOT RESIGN . I AM THE PRESIDENT . YOU ARE GUILTY OF TREASON . "

AT THIS POINT, NHU LEAPED INTO THE ARGUMENT, CURSING . ONE OF THE

GENERALS BACKED AWAY, DREW A PISTOL AND BEGAN SHOOTING . THE

BULLET-RIDDLED BODIES WERE PUT BACK IN THE ARMORED CAR AND TAKEN OFF TO

ST . PAUL'S HOSPITAL . LAST WEEK THE BODIES WERE CLAIMED BY A RELATIVE

OF DIEM'S, PLACED IN HERMETICALLY SEALED METAL CASKETS, AND TAKEN BACK

TO COUP HEADQUARTERS .

ALMOST BECOME A NATIONAL OBSESSION, IS THE SUCCESSOR TO JAWAHARLAL

NEHRU, 74.  INDIA TODAY IS STILL SMARTING FROM THE SAVAGE BEATING IT

TOOK AT THE HANDS OF RED CHINA LAST FALL, THE ECONOMY IS FALTERING

UNDER BUREAUCRATIC CONTROLS, AND THE FACTION-RIVEN GOVERNMENT IS

FLAWED WITH CORRUPTION.  RESTIVE POLITICIANS SAY BLUNTLY THAT ALL

THEIR PROBLEMS CANNOT BE SOLVED BY THE STOOPED, CAREWORN PRIME

MINISTER AND THE ELDERLY, OUT-OF-TOUCH CONGRESS PARTY LEADERSHIP.

A CELEBRATED CRITICISM OF NEHRU IS THAT HE RESEMBLES INDIA'S

BANYAN TREE, WHICH PROVERBIALLY KILLS EVERY OTHER ORGANISM THAT

GROWS IN ITS SHADE.  IN THE WAKE OF THREE PARLIAMENTARY BY-ELECTION

DEFEATS LAST SPRING, NEHRU ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD ASK A DOZEN TOP

CABINET AND STATE MINISTERS TO RESIGN FROM THE GOVERNMENT IN ORDER

TO LET THEM GO TO WORK REVITALIZING THE PARTY ORGANIZATION AND

REBUILDING ITS STRENGTH AMONG THE VOTERS.  BUT THE KAMARAJ PLAN

WAS REALLY USED BY THE PRIME MINISTER AS A RUSE TO FLUSH OUT ALL THE

TOP CONTENDERS FOR HIS OWN JOB.  THERE IS EVEN WIDESPREAD

SUSPICION THAT NEHRU FORCED THE RESIGNATIONS OF HIS ABLEST MINISTERS

IN ORDER TO CLEAR THE WAY FOR HIS DAUGHTER, IMPERIOUS INDIRA GANDHI,

45, WIDOW OF A BACKBENCH CONGRESS POLITICIAN (NO KIN TO THE MAHATMA),

WHO HAS LONG BEEN THE PRIME MINISTER'S CLOSEST CONFIDANTE (HE

CALLS HER INDU, OR MOON), OFFICIAL HOSTESS AND POLITICAL

TROUBLESHOOTER.

RULER OF THE WORLD.  BUT DISCOUNTING INDIRA AS A REAL POLITICAL

CONTENDER, THE CHOICE OF MOST PARTY MEMBERS AT PRESENT IS FORMER HOME

MINISTER LAL BAHADUR SHASTRI, 59, AN HONEST IF COLORLESS POLITICIAN WHO,

LIKE HIS LEADER, COMES FROM UTTAR PRADESH, INDIA'S MOST POPULOUS

STATE AND THE TRADITIONAL BREEDING GROUND OF CONGRESS PARTY LEADERS.

IF SHASTRI IS DISQUALIFIED--HE HAD A HEART ATTACK IN 1959--A

LEADING CONTENDER FOR THE PRIMEMINISTERSHIP WOULD PROBABLY BE

S. K. PATIL, 63, A RIGHT-WINGER WHO RUNS BOMBAY WITH BRISK EFFICIENCY

AND UNTIL THE CABINET PURGE COPED ABLY WITH THE THANKLESS JOB OF

FOOD MINISTER, THOUGH GRAIN SHORTAGES PROMPTED THE CRACK THAT

HE "GAVE INDIA FOOD--FOR THOUGHT."

MORARJI DESAI, 67, A STERN ASCETIC WHO WAS NEHRU'S FINANCE

MINISTER AND WAS ONCE A FAVORITE TO SUCCEED HIM, HAS LOST MUCH OF HIS

POPULARITY IN THE PAST YEAR, LARGELY AS A RESULT OF HIS DRACONIAN

MEASURES TO RAISE TAXES FOR THE DEFENSE EFFORT, BUT COULD STILL BE

THE POWERFUL RIGHT WING'S CHOICE.

AS FOR NEHRU, HE IS DETERMINED TO HOLD ON TO HIS POST INDEFINITELY,

BUT EVEN INDIA'S MOST POPULAR MAN OCCASIONALLY FACES THE

LIMITATIONS OF FAME IN A COUNTRY THAT IS STILL ONLY 24 PER CENT

LITERATE.  IN A SURVEY OF VILLAGERS LIVING LESS THAN 20 MILES FROM

BUSTLING HYDERABAD, UNIVERSITY RESEARCHERS REPORTED THAT PEASANTS

VARIOUSLY IDENTIFIED NEHRU AS "HEAD OF A GERMAN STATE," "RULER

OF THE WORLD," AND "SOME BRAHMAN."  NAMED FOR KAMARAJ NADAR,

FORMER CHIEF MINISTER OF MADRAS, WHO FIRST EMPLOYED IT TO

ADVANTAGE IN HIS OWN STATE ADMINISTRATION.

GOVERNMENT TO LOCK UP ANY GHANAIAN WITHOUT TRIAL FOR FIVE YEARS, MERELY

BY CHARGING THAT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ACCUSED MIGHT PREJUDICE

GREECE  HUBRIS DOESN'T WIN  FOR COMMITTING THE SIN OF HUBRIS

(OVERWEENING PRIDE), THE FATES TOPPLED THE HEROES OF ANCIENT GREECE .

LAST WEEK GREEK VOTERS DEFEATED THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PREMIER

IN THE COUNTRY'S HISTORY, HANDSOME, HARD-DRIVING

CONSTANTINE KARAMANLIS, WHO HAD SHOWN MORE THAN A TOUCH OF HUBRIS WHEN

HE SAID IN A CAMPAIGN SPEECH:  "THE TRUE POLITICAL LEADER DOES NOT NEED

THE PEOPLE . THE PEOPLE NEED THE TRUE POLITICAL LEADER ." DURING HIS

EIGHT-YEAR REIGN, KARAMANLIS HAD, AS HE SAID, "TRANSFORMED GREECE

FROM AN ORIENTAL VILLAGE TO A EUROPEAN COUNTRY ." HE BROUGHT THE NATION

INTO THE COMMON MARKET AS AN ASSOCIATE MEMBER, BUILT DAMS AND ROADS .

ON THE AVERAGE, MANUFACTURING HAS GROWN AN IMPRESSIVE 8 PERCENT ANNUALLY

IN THE PAST DECADE, GOVERNMENT RESERVES SHOT UP BY 400 PERCENT, AND

REVENUES MORE THAN DOUBLED - - THANKS IN PART TO TOURISM, WHICH THIS

YEAR GROSSED SOME $90 MILLION .  THERE ARE DARK SPOTS IN THIS SUNNY

PICTURE -- SOME 100,000 YOUNG GREEKS HAVE EMIGRATED TO WEST GERMANY TO

FIND JOBS, AND POVERTY RETAINS ITS GRIP ON PRIMITIVE MOUNTAIN VILLAGES .

STREET PEDDLERS IN ATHENS STILL HAUL SPONGES, BANANAS AND CHESNUTS --

BUT THEY NOW WALK BENEATH GLITTERING NEON SIGNS THAT REVEAL THE

INTERNATIONALIZATION OF AN INCREASINGLY MODERN ECONOMY:  IBM, SIEMENS,

HAIG & HAIG, DINERS CLUB . REJECTED ADVICE . STRONGLY ANTI-COMMUNIST AND

PRO-NATO, KARAMANLIS WELDED HIS RIGHT-WING NATIONAL RADICAL UNION

INTO A POWERFUL PARTY, GAVE GREECE THE LONGEST STRETCH OF POLITICAL

STABILITY IN MODERN TIMES .  BUT THERE WERE PROTESTS, WHEN KARAMANLIS

WAS RE-ELECTED FOR A FOURTH TERM IN 1961, THAT POLICE IN THE BACK

COUNTRY HAD INTIMIDATED VOTERS .  THOUGH MANY ELECTION BRAWLS WERE

DELIBERATELY PROVOKED BY LEFTISTS, THEY CONVINCED LEFT-WING BRITISH

LABORITES AND OTHER ALLIES ABROAD THAT GREECE LIVED UNDER A TYRANNY .

LAST JUNE, AFTER

KING PAUL AND QUEEN FREDERIKA REJECTED KARAMANLIS' ADVICE TO CALL OFF

A STATE VISIT TO BRITAIN BECAUSE OF THE DANGER OF LEFTIST DEMONSTRATIONS

IN LONDON, THE PREMIER QUIT IN A HUFF .  WHILE KARAMANLIS SULKED IN

A SWISS VILLA FOR THREE MONTHS AND A CARETAKER CABINET LED BY HIS

POLITICAL ALLIES RULED THE COUNTRY, THE OPPOSITION CENTER UNION PARTY

LAUNCHED AN INTENSE ELECTION CAMPAIGN .  IT WAS LED BY AN AGED

DEMOSTHENES, GEORGE PAPANDREOU, 75, VETERAN OF SEVERAL PREWAR CABINETS

AND THE NATION'S FIRST POSTWAR PREMIER .  TO KARAMANLIS' BOAST THAT

GREECE HAS PROSPERED, PAPANDREOU REPLIED:  "NUMBERS PROSPER, THE PEOPLE

SUFFER ."  FARMERS, WHO HAD BENEFITED LEAST FROM THE BOOM BECAUSE OF

LOW PRICES FOR THEIR GOODS, GOT PAPANDREOU'S EASY PROMISE THAT HE WOULD

FORGIVE THEIR DEBTS .  ABOVE ALL, CAMPAIGNER PAPANDREOU CONCENTRATED

ON THE OLD 1961 CHARGES OF ELECTION FRAUD, CRIED THAT HE WAS

DETERMINED TO SAVE THE NATION FROM THE "FASCIST AND TERRORIST" POLICIES

OF KARAMANLIS .  NO THANKS .  KARAMANLIS, RELYING ON HIS IMPRESSIVE

ECONOMIC RECORD, CAMPAIGNED AS THOUGH HE EXPECTED THE PEOPLE TO THANK

HIM FOR RUNNING .  TO THE SURPRISE OF ALMOST EVERYONE, THEY DIDN'T .

A NEAR-RECORD TURNOUT OF 4,600,000 VOTERS GAVE PAPANDREOU'S CENTER

UNION 140 SEATS IN THE 300-MEMBER PARLIAMENT; KARAMANLIS' NATIONAL

RADICALS GOT 128 .  WINNER PAPANDREOU CELEBRATED BY DANCING MOST OF

THE NIGHT .  KARAMANLIS WAS FURIOUS, HASTILY ANNOUNCED HE WAS QUITTING

POLITICS .  AFTER A TALK WITH KING PAUL AT TATOI PALACE, HE CHANGED

HIS MIND .  AFTER ALL, PAPANDREOU LACKED A MAJORITY OF ELEVEN SEATS .

THE PREMIER COULD HAVE A SAFE MARGIN IF HE ACCEPTED THE EAGER SUPPORT

OF 30 PRO-COMMUNIST DEPUTIES, BUT SO FAR PRO-WESTERN PAPANDREOU HAS

REJECTED THE OFFER . BETWEEN NOW AND DEC . 11, WHEN PARLIAMENT CONVENES,

KARAMANLIS HOPES TO ATTRACT ENOUGH DEPUTIES TO DEFEAT THE OPENING VOTE

OF CONFIDENCE, IF HE SUCCEEDS, GREECE WILL BE IN FOR NEW ELECTIONS

AND ANOTHER FREE-SWINGING CAMPAIGN .

THE COMMUNISTS LOVE THE IDEA . THEY ARE SAYING REASSURINGLY THAT THEY

WEST GERMANY FROM THE TOMB WHEN A RESERVOIR BROKE AND FLOODED AN

IRON MINE NEAR LENGEDE, SAXONY, TWO WEEKS AGO, 79 WORKERS SCRAMBLED TO

SAFETY, AND TEN MORE WERE RESCUED . THE REMAINING 40, ENTOMBED WITHOUT

FOOD FOR TEN DAYS, WERE GIVEN UP FOR DEAD . THE GIANT OIL DRILL THAT

HAD BORED THE RESCUE SHAFTS FOR THE OTHERS WAS DISMANTLED AND STARTED

ON ITS WAY BACK TO THE NETHERLANDS . THE CROWDS OF REPORTERS AND

ONLOOKERS DRIFTED AWAY . ALL THAT REMAINED WAS TO HOLD A MEMORIAL

SERVICE . SOME OF THE SURVIVORS INSISTED THAT THE RESCUERS CONTINUE

BORING EXPLORATORY SHAFTS, USING A SMALLER DRILL . SUDDENLY THE

SKEPTICAL RESCUE TEAM WAS ELECTRIFIED BY A SERIES OF RAPS ON THE DRILL

BIT . OVER A QUICKLY LOWERED PHONE LINE, WORD CAME THAT ELEVEN MEN WERE

ALIVE IN AN ABANDONED GALLERY, 196 FT . BELOW . MEMORIAL SERVICES WERE

CANCELED AND THE OIL RIG HURRIEDLY RECALLED . THERE WERE BREATHLESS

WERE HEARD FROM, THE FIRST OF THE MINERS EMERGED FROM THE " RESCUE

MIDDLE EAST DANGER : PROFESSOR AT WORK TOURING THE

MIDDLE EAST UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE U.S . STATE DEPARTMENT, DUKE

ELLINGTON AND HIS BAND FOUND THEMSELVES CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A COUP

IN IRAQ LAST WEEK . FASCINATED BY THE GOINGS-ON, THE DUKE PROMISED TO

COMPOSE A NEW PIECE, " THE BAGHDAD ROCK AND I DO MEAN ROCKING WITH

ROCKETS, BOMBS AND ALL . " THE DUKE MIGHT JUST AS WELL WRITE ANOTHER

PIECE CALLED THE DAMASCUS REEL, FOR SYRIA, TOO, UNDERWENT A SHAKE-UP,

QUIETER BUT NO LESS SIGNIFICANT . BEHIND THE SUDDEN SHUFFLE OF MIDDLE

EASTERN LEADERS WAS A POWER STRUGGLE INSIDE A STRANGE NEW POLITICAL

FORCE, THE BAATH (RENAISSANCE) PARTY, WHICH IN LITTLE LESS THAN A YEAR

HAS TURNED FROM A SHADOWY, CLANDESTINE MOVEMENT WITHOUT POPULAR SUPPORT

INTO A DYNAMIC POWER CHALLENGING GAMAL ABDEL NASSER FOR LEADERSHIP OF

THE ARAB WORLD . THE AVOWED AIM OF BAATH IS TO UNITE IRAQ AND SYRIA,

WHICH IT ALREADY CONTROLS, AND TO ADD ALL OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES TO THIS

UNION, THROUGH PERSUASION OR SUBVERSION . LAST WEEK'S TUSSLES WERE

CAUSED PARTLY BY THE CLASH OF AMBITIONS WITHIN THE PARTY, PARTLY BY

DIFFERENCES OVER HOW QUICKLY AND RADICALLY THE BAATH AIMS SHOULD BE

PURSUED . OUT OF THE SHADOWS . IN SYRIA, PREMIER SALAH BITAR, 52, A

CO-FOUNDER OF THE BAATH PARTY, RESIGNED AFTER BEING ACCUSED IN PARTY

COUNCILS OF " SELF-ISOLATION FROM THE MASSES . " TRANSLATION : HE MUST

MAKE WAY FOR AN AMBITIOUS, YOUNGER RIVAL . THE RIVAL : AMIN HAFEZ, 42,

SYRIAN COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND A TOP PARTY LEADER, WHO TOOK OVER AS

PREMIER . AS A PRELUDE TO HIS SWEARINGIN, JETS WHOOSHED OVERHEAD IN

SALUTE AND TO DISCOURAGE ANY POSSIBLE TROUBLE . IN IRAQ, THE STRUGGLE

WAS BETWEEN BURLY VICE PREMIER ALI SALEH SAADI, A RADICAL, AND A

FACTION OF MODERATES HEADED BY FOREIGN MINISTER TALIB SHABIB AND

INTERIOR MINISTER HAZIM JAWAD . SAADI AND HIS FRIENDS WANT MORE OR LESS

INSTANT SOCIALIZATION OF THE IRAQI ECONOMY, CRACKDOWN ON THE MIDDLE

CLASS, REVOLUTION THROUGHOUT THE ARAB WORLD, AND AN ANTI-WESTERN POLICY

. SHABIB, JAWAD & CO . FAVOR A SLOWER, MORE CONCILIATORY COURSE . AT

FIRST IT LOOKED LIKE A CLEAR VICTORY FOR THE MODERATES . BACKED BY

GUN-TOTING AIDES, SHABIB AND JAWAD SEIZED SAADI AND THREE OTHER CABINET

MINISTERS, BUNDLED THEM INTO A MILITARY PLANE WITHOUT LUGGAGE AND FLEW

THEM TO EXILE IN MADRID WHERE SAADI KEPT HINTING THAT HE WOULD YET

RETURN TO IRAQ IN TRIUMPH . NEXT MORNING SAADI'S SUPPORTERS IN THE

LABOR UNIONS AND THE NATIONAL GUARD POURED INTO THE STREETS OF BAGHDAD,

LED BY AIR FORCE COLONEL MUNZER WANDARI, A FIERCELY MUSTACHIOED FANATIC

WHO PERSONALLY TOOK UP A JET FIGHTER AND STRAFED THE PRESIDENTIAL

PALACE WITH ROCKETS . WHEN THE MODERATES CALLED ON THE ARMY FOR HELP,

TROOPS CLEARED THE STREETS AND JAILED WANDARI . BUT HE HAD APPARENTLY

MADE HIS POINT . AN EMERGENCY MEETING OF THE BAATH HIGH COMMAND DECIDED

UPON A PLAGUE-ON-BOTH-YOUR-HOUSES GESTURE : SHABIB, JAWAD AND FIVE

AIDES WERE HUSTLED INTO ANOTHER PLANE AND SENT INTO EXILE TOO IN BEIRUT

. STRANGELY SILENT IN THE UPROAR WAS THE ONE NON-BAATHIST IN A POSITION

OF POWER, IRAQ'S PRESIDENT ABDUL SALAM AREF, WHO WAS REPORTEDLY UNDER

PALACE ARREST . UNTIL PARTY ELECTIONS ARE HELD SOME TIME NEXT YEAR,

IRAQ WILL APPARENTLY BE RUN BY THE BAATH CENTRAL COMMITTEE (WHICH

INCLUDES A JORDANIAN, A LEBANESE AND A KUWAITI AS WELL AS IRAQI AND

SYRIAN GENERALS) AND BY MICHEL AFLAK, THE SECRETARY-GENERAL AND REAL

POWER IN THE PARTY . IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT AFLAK, A WITHDRAWN,

SEEMINGLY GENTLE INTELLECTUAL WHO HAS SANCTIONED THE EXECUTIONS OF

HUNDREDS OF POLITICAL OPPONENTS, EMERGED FROM HIS SHADOWY POSITION

BEHIND THE SCENES . NATIONAL FAMILIES . WHAT PRECISELY IS BAATH ?

NASSER SEEMS TO CONSIDER IT AN EVEN GREATER THREAT THAN HIS OLD

ENEMIES, THE ARAB MONARCHIES OF JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA, AND COMPLAINS

: " I HAVE READ EVERY BOOK BY OR ABOUT BAATH AND I COULD UNDERSTAND

NOTHING . " A WESTERN DIPLOMAT DESCRIBES IT AS AN " ARAB COSA NOSTRA .

/ ON THE CONTRARY, ONE KNOWLEDGEABLE OBSERVER THINKS BAATH " IS

PROBABLY AHEAD OF ITS TIME REFORMIST, PROGRESSIVE AND SECULAR IN A

WORLD OF ARABS BOUND BY TRADITION, RELIGION AND NARROW, PERSONAL

INTEREST . " FOUNDER AFLAK, 53, WHOSE SCHOLARLY MANNER HAS WON HIM THE

NICKNAME " THE PROFESSOR, " DEFINES BAATH THROUGH HIS CAREER AS MUCH AS

THROUGH HIS WORDS BORN IN DAMASCUS TO THE GREEK ORTHODOX FAITH IN AN

OVERWHELMINGLY MOSLEM ENVIRONMENT (AFLAK'S FATHER WAS A MODERATELY

SUCCESSFUL GRAIN MERCHANT, AND HIS MOTHER, NOW 75, IS STILL

ILLITERATE), AFLAK GOT HONORS IN HISTORY AT THE SORBONNE . IN PARIS HE

ARGUED POLITICS WITH OTHER AFRO-ASIAN STUDENTS, READ MARX, NIETZSCHE

AND JEFFERSON . HE SAYS, " I QUICKLY FOUND MARXISM INADEQUATE, BASED ON

MATERIALISM WITHOUT HUMAN AND SPIRITUAL VALUES, WITHOUT NATIONAL

CONSCIOUSNESS . NATIONS ARE ONLY LARGE FAMILIES, AND THE ARAB FAMILY

NEEDS MORE THAN MARX . THUS WE EVOLVED THE BAATHIST DOCTRINE OF

SOCIALISM MINGLED WITH NATIONALISM AND THE HUMAN SPIRIT . " RETURNING

TO DAMASCUS AS A TEACHER, AFLAK WAS SOON INDOCTRINATING STUDENTS IN HIS

REVOLUTIONARY IDEALS, DRAWING SUPPORT FROM THOSE WHO WERE OVEREDUCATED,

UNEMPLOYED SONS OF THE POOR . IN 1942, AFTER LEADING A STRIKE AGAINST

FENCH HISTORY TEXTS BEING USED IN SYRIAN SCHOOLS, HE QUIT TEACHING AND

BECAME A FULLTIME AGITATOR, DRAWING SUPPORT FROM THOSE WHO, LIKE

HIMSELF, WERE OVEREDUCATED, UNDEREMPLOYED SONS OF PEASANTS AND WORKERS

. THE LUMINOUS CLASSICAL ARABIC OF HIS POLITICAL TRACTS FILLS BAATHISTS

WITH ECSTASY, BUT IN ENGLISH TRANSLATION, HIS IDEAS SEEM RATHER MURKY

: " NATIONALISM IS LOVE BEFORE EVERYTHING ELSE " ; " REVOLUTION IS

THE OPPOSITION OF TRUTH TO THE EXISTING SITUATION . " AFLAK WROTE

BAATH'S DEMOCRATIC-SOUNDING CONSTITUTION IN FIVE DAYS, AND IT HAS NEVER

SINCE BEEN CHANGED OR, FOR THAT MATTER, IMPLEMENTED .

BY 1947, AFTER THE FRENCH LEFT

SYRIA, BAATH HAD 1,000 CAREFULLY SELECTED MEMBERS, AND AFLAK CALLED THE

FIRST NATIONAL CONGRESS IN A DAMASCUS CAFE . TWO YEARS LATER HE WAS

STRONG ENOUGH TO HELP TOPPLE A SYRIAN GOVERNMENT AND SERVED IN THE

CABINET FOR THREE MONTHS BEFORE RESIGNING ON THE GROUND THAT HE WAS OF

MORE VALUE TO BAATH OUTSIDE THE GOVERNMENT THAN IN IT . COLLIDING

AMBITIONS . AFLAK WAS PROFOUNDLY SHAKEN BY THE 1948 ARAB DEFEAT IN

PALESTINE . DURING THE FIGHTING HE PROWLED THE FRONT, LIVING WITH ARAB

TROOPS . " THE ARAB SOCIAL STRUCTURE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DISASTER,

/ HE SAYS . " A SOCIETY BASED ON DISUNITY AND INEQUALITY PREVENTED THE

ARABS FROM REACHING THEIR FULL POTENTIAL . " TODAY HE IS AS VOCAL AS

ANY ARAB LEADER ABOUT DRIVING THE ISRAELIS INTO THE SEA . AT FIRST,

BAATH WORKED WILLINGLY WITH NASSER . AT THE THIRD PARTY CONGRESS IN

1956, BAATH DECIDED ON THE UNION OF SYRIA WITH EGYPT THAT WAS

ACCOMPLISHED TWO YEARS LATER . BUT THE RIVAL AMBITIONS OF NASSER AND

BAATH COLLIDED . SYRIA BROKE AWAY FROM EGYPT IN 1961 AND BECAME A

BAATH-DOMINATED STATE AFTER A MILITARY COUP LAST MARCH . BAATH HAD

ALREADY WON BLOODY CONTROL OF IRAQ A MONTH EARLIER AND TELEVISED THE

GORY SCENE OF THE EXECUTION OF DICTATOR KASSEM . SINCE THEN, BAATH HAS

SUCCESSFULLY AND BLOODILY PUT DOWN TWO NASSERITE INSURRECTIONS IN IRAQ

AND FIVE IN SYRIA, AND ITS LEADERS ARE UNDERSTANDABLY BITTER ABOUT

NASSER . SAYS ONE : " WE LOVED HIM AND CHERISHED HIM, THE BASTARD .

NASSER IS A LOST PROPHET . HE TRIES TO ANNIHILATE US, THE DEVIL . WE

ARE IDEALISTS AND DON'T WANT TO KILL, BUT HE MAKES US KILL . WE HAVE TO

USE HIS TACTICS, DAMN HIM . " THE EGYPTIAN PRESS AND RADIO IN TURN

PICTURE AFLAK AS A COMBINATION OF ROBESPIERRE, STALIN, BEN-GURION AND

THE POPE . WHENEVER CAIRO RADIO MENTIONS HIM, IT IS FOLLOWED BY THE

INTERJECTION " YANI, YANI " (I MEAN, I MEAN), GIBING AT THE FUZZINESS

OF HIS POLITICAL CONCEPTS . TOTAL HOSTILITY . BAATH DEPENDS ON 50,000

PARTY MEMBERS SCATTERED IN EIGHTMAN CELLS THROUGHOUT THE ARAB WORLD . "

WE COULD TAKE IN THOUSANDS MORE, " AFLAK BOASTS, " BUT WE MUST SCREEN

OUT OPPORTUNISTS, IDLERS AND ENEMY AGENTS . " NOT ONLY NASSER, BUT ALSO

ARAB MONARCHS, BUSINESSMEN AND THE TRADITIONAL, MIDDLE-CLASS

POLITICIANS DETEST BAATH . ARAB CHRISTIANS FEAR BEING SUBMERGED IN A

UNITED ARAB STATE . THE KURDISH TRIBESMEN, WHO ARE MOSLEMS BUT NOT

ARABS, HAVE WAGED A LONG, BITTER WAR FOR AUTONOMY IN NORTHERN IRAQ .

ORIGINALLY, THE COMMUNISTS WERE NUMBERED AMONG THE MANY FOES OF BAATH,

AND IN IRAQ WERE HUNTED DOWN AND EXECUTED, WHILE MOSCOW RAILED AGAINST

/ BAATHIST GENOCIDE . " BUT RECENTLY, PERHAPS IN A SEARCH FOR ALLIES, A

BAATH OFFICIAL IN IRAQ ANNOUNCED THAT " THE RED HUNT IS OVER, " AND

HUNDREDS OF COMMUNISTS WERE RELEASED FROM JAIL . COMMUNIST LEADERS ARE

JOINING BAATH IN CALLING FOR " THE LIQUIDATION OF FEUDALISM, " AND THE

BAATH PARTY NEWSPAPER PROCLAIMS " TOTAL HOSTILITY GAINST CAPITALISM . "

STILL BETTING THAT IRAQ AND SYRIA, WHILE ANTI-WESTERN, WILL REMAIN

ANTI-COMMUNIST, THE U.S . THIS YEAR IS SUPPLYING CREDITS AND LOANS OF

MORE THAN $60 MILLION . IN TAKING OVER, BAATH FOUND BOTH COUNTRIES

NEARLY BANKRUPT AND HAS TRIED TO REVIVE THE ECONOMY WITH SOCIALIST

CURE-ALLS RANGING FROM NATIONALIZATION OF INDUSTRY (INCLUDING, IN

SYRIA, THE ADVERTISING BUSINESS) TO CONVERTING STATE LAND INTO FARM

COLLECTIVES . FOR STRATEGIC REASONS, A PAVED HIGHWAY FROM BAGHDAD TO

DAMASCUS IS BEING PUSHED TO COMPLETION . THIS YEAR'S RICH COTTON

HARVEST PROMISES A $100 MILLION WINDFALL FOR SYRIA, AND IRAQ'S COFFERS

ARE BEING REFILLED BY OIL REVENUES . BRAINWASHING . AS SET UP BY AFLAK,

THE ORGANIZATION OF BAATH RESEMBLES THAT OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY . EACH

CELL ELECTS A LEADER, CELL LEADERS ELECT DISTRICT CHIEFS AND SO ON, UP

TO THE VARIOUS REGIONAL CONGRESSES . OVER THEM STANDS THE POWERFUL

CENTRAL COMMITTEE, WHICH REALLY RUNS THE WHOLE SHOW . IN DEALING WITH

POLITICAL OPPONENTS, BAATH TENDS TO RELY ON THE FIRING SQUAD, BUT BAATH

MEETINGS ARE CONDUCTED STRICTLY BY ROBERT'S RULES OF ORDER . MEMBERSHIP

IS GAINED ONLY AFTER A MINIMUM OF TWO YEARS AS A CANDIDATE " ON TRIAL

FOR SINCERITY AND INTENSITY . " BAATHISM IS BEING EXTENDED TO THE

SYRIAN AND IRAQI ARMIES IN ADDITION TO MILITARY DUTY EACH SOLDIER MUST

SPEND TWO HOURS A DAY BEING POLITICALLY INDOCTRINATED . BAATHIST POLICE

OFFICIALS ARE NOW TRYING THEIR HAND AT BRAINWASHING POLITICAL

PRISONERS, AND BOAST THAT THEY HAVE EVEN CONVERTED COMMUNISTS . AS LAST

WEEK PROVED, BAATH CAN BE AS HARD ON ITS OWN LEADERS AS ON ITS ENEMIES

. MICHEL AFLAK, AS SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE BAATH CENTRAL COMMITTEE,

HAS SURVIVED AS THE ONLY STABLE ELEMENT IN BAATH . HE HAS NEVER MADE A

RADIO OR TV SPEECH, SELDOM APPEARS IN PUBLIC, BUT HE IS A VIRTUOSO IN

MAN-TO-MAN DISCUSSIONS, AND PREMIERS, CABINET MEMBERS AND GENERALS

DUTIFULLY REPORT TO HIM FOR " ADVICE . " IN FACT, MANY OF THE DECISIONS

IN LAST WEEK'S WHOLESALE FIRINGS OF BAATH LEADERS WERE HAMMERED OUT IN

AFLAK'S MODEST, FOUR-ROOM DAMASCUS APARTMENT, WITH WASH FLAPPING ON THE

BALCONY AND HIS TWO SMALL CHILDREN PLAYING UNDERFOOT UNTIL THE CRISIS

FORCED HIM TO FLY TO BAGHDAD AND TAKE CHARGE PERSONALLY . HE WAS

PLAINLY RELUCTANT TO DO SO . " I STAY AWAY FROM POWER, " HE SAYS . " I

AM INCAPABLE OF GOVERNING . " AFLAK IS CONFIDENT OF ACCOMPLISHING ALL

HIS VISIONARY GOALS IN HIS OWN LIFETIME . SAYS HE : " WE HAVE MANY

INTELLECTUALS IN THE PARTY, BUT NOT ENOUGH EXECUTIVE AND TECHNICAL

TALENT . WE NEED MORE TRAINED CADRES . WE NEED MORE FUNDS . WE NEED

MORE TIME . WE NEED MORE OF EVERYTHING . " THE MAJOR PROBLEM IS WHETHER

BAATH'S OLD ARAB ENEMIES AND NEW COMMUNIST ALLIES AS WELL AS ITS OWN

IMPATIENT RADICALS WILL ALLOW THE PARTY THE TIME IT NEEDS . MEANWHILE,

DOES AFLAK EVER HAVE NIGHTMARES ABOUT BAATH'S VICTIMS ? HE SAYS : "

WEAKENED WILLINGNESS . THE U.S . FEELS THAT IF THE RUSSIANS WANT TO

TRADE, THEY SHOULD BE FORCED TO USE UP THEIR MEAGER GOLD RESERVES AND

NOT BE GRANTED WHAT THEY WANT LONG-TERM CREDITS . SUCH CREDITS WOULD

RELEASE MASSIVE SOVIET INVESTMENT FOR MILITARY NEEDS AND DIVERT

FREE-WORLD RESOURCES FROM AID TO UNDERDEVELOPED NATIONS . UNDER

SECRETARY OF STATE GEORGE BALL LAST WEEK WOUND UP A TOUR OF WESTERN

EUROPE DURING WHICH HE ARGUED THE U.S . CASE FOR A UNIFIED, STIFFER

WESTERN CREDIT POLICY AT LEAST 20 PER CENT CASH AND THE REST WITHIN

FIVE YEARS . BALL RECEIVED HIS FRIENDLIEST HEARING IN WEST GERMANY,

EVEN THOUGH BONN TOPS THE LIST OF ALLIED TRADERS WITH THE REDS . WEST

GERMANY LAST YEAR DID JUST OVER 1 BILLION WORTH OF OFFICIAL BUSINESS

WITH MOSCOW AND ITS SATELLITES (INCLUDING $422 MILLION WITH THE SOVIET

UNION AND $213 MILLION WITH EAST GERMANY) ; NO ONE CAN GUESS

ACCURATELY HOW MUCH MORE PRIVATE TRADE WENT ON . THOUGH SOME GERMAN

INDUSTRIALISTS WERE ANXIOUS FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO GUARANTEE LONG-TERM

CREDITS, CHANCELLOR LUDWIG ERHARD RULED OUT THE IDEA AS LONG AS THE

SOVIETS BLOCK GERMAN REUNIFICATION . SAID ERHARD : " SUCH CREDITS

WOULD STRENGTHEN THE SOVIET POSITION, SO THAT ITS WILLINGNESS TO

NEGOTIATE WOULD BE WEAKENED . " GENTLEMEN'S DISAGREEMENT . IN PARIS,

BALL ALSO GOT A SYMPATHETIC RECEPTION, A PLEASANT CHANGE FOR A U.S .

ENVOY THESE DAYS . FRANCE LAST YEAR EXPORTED TO THE SOVIET BLOC GOODS

WORTH ONLY ABOUT $266 MILLION ; RUSSIAN BARTER PROPOSALS, INVOLVING A

SWAP OF SOVIET COAL AND OIL FOR HEAVY INDUSTRIAL GOODS, ARE HIGHLY

UNATTRACTIVE SINCE FRANCE CAN SELL ITS OWN COAL AND OIL INSIDE THE

COMMON MARKET . BESIDES, CHARLES DE GAULLE BELIEVES THAT TRADING WITH

THE SOVIETS IS A DIRTY BUSINESS (ALTHOUGH HE SEEMS WILLING TO TRADE

WITH RED CHINA) AND RECENTLY DENIED AN EXPORT LICENSE TO A LEADING

FRENCH STEEL COMPANY THAT WAS ALL SET TO BUILD A REFINERY IN RUSSIA .

ONLY IN LONDON DID BALL FIND OPPOSITION ; THE BRITISH FLATLY DECLINED

TO JOIN THE GENTLEMEN'S AGREEMENT TO RESTRICT THE SOVIETS' CREDIT .

BRITAIN IS ESPECIALLY FOND OF THE IDEA THAT MORE TRADE WITH MOSCOW,

INCLUDING STRATEGIC GOODS, WILL EVENTUALLY PACIFY THE SOVIETS .

MOREOVER, THE NEW TORY GOVERNMENT IS EAGER TO REDUCE UNEMPLOYMENT BY

INCREASING OUTPUT AND SHIPPING THE GOODS OVERSEAS AS FAST AS POSSIBLE .

THE PLAN HAS NOT WORKED SO FAR : BRITISH EXPORTS TO RUSSIA AND EASTERN

EUROPE TOTALED ONLY ABOUT $310 MILLION IN 1962, AND NO BIG TRADE DEAL

APPEARS IMMINENT .

GREAT BRITAIN INTO BATTLE " I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS FIGHT, /

SAID SIR ALEC DOUGLAS-HOME LAST WEEK . " I'M ALMOST SPOILING FOR IT . "

HE DID NOT HAVE LONG TO SPOIL . NEXT DAY, AS PARLIAMENT REASSEMBLED,

SHOUTING, LEAPING TORY BACKBENCHERS CHEERED LUSTILY WHILE THE NEWLY

ELECTED MEMBER FOR KINROSS TOOK HIS OATH AS AN M.P . AND MOVED INTO HIS

PLACE FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THE GOVERNMENT'S FRONT BENCH . PULLING OUT

A SMALL RED AND GOLD BALLPOINT PEN, DOUGLAS-HOME HUNCHED DOWN IN HIS

SEAT AND SCRIBBLED FURIOUSLY ON SLIPS OF PAPER FOR THE NEXT 42 MINUTES

WHILE LABOR PARTY LEADER HAROLD WILSON DELIVERED A CUTTING ATTACK ON

THE GOVERNMENT . LIKE A POSTER . CLAIMING THAT THE TORIES' "

MODERNIZATION " PLANS FOR NEW ROADS, SCHOOLS AND HOUSING WERE BORROWED

FROM LABOR, WILSON SAID TARTLY : " IMITATION IS THE SINCEREST FORM OF

POLITICAL DESPERATION . " WHY, HE CONTINUED, " HAVE WE HEARD SO LITTLE

ABOUT MODERNIZATION IN THE PAST TWELVE YEARS ? I NEVER UNDERVALUE THE

POWER OF REPENTANCE, BUT IT HAS TAKEN A VERY LONG TIME . " AMID CRIES

OF APPROVAL AND DERISION FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE PACKED HOUSE, THE PRIME

MINISTER ROSE, NERVOUSLY SHUFFLED HIS NOTES AND PLACED THEM NEATLY ON

THE DISPATCH BOX IN FRONT OF HIM . " IT'S BEEN TWELVE YEARS SINCE I

LAST SPOKE IN THIS HOUSE, " HE BEGAN. IN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES IT

BECAME ALL TOO PLAIN THAT THE COZIER, CLUBBISH STYLE OF THE HOUSE OF

LORDS HAD BLUNTED DOUGLAS-HOME'S DEBATING THRUST, AND HIS SUPPORTERS

MISSED HIS USUAL PUNGENT WIT . AFTER A LONG, MEANDERING PREAMBLE, HE

LAUNCHED INTO A LACKLUSTER EXPOSITION OF AMBITIOUS GOVERNMENT POLICIES

FOR THE COMING YEAR . " THE FORMULA, " SAID HE FLATLY, " IS GROWTH

WITHOUT INFLATION, AND THE METHOD, ACCELERATION FROM POSITIONS

PREVIOUSLY PREPARED . " GROANED ONE CONSERVATIVE : " GOD, IT'S LIKE A

TORY ELECTION POSTER ! " TWICE SIR ALEC EVEN MADE THE TACTICAL GAFFE

OF REFERRING TO WILSON AS " POSSIBLE LATER PRIME MINISTER . " THE TORY

BENCHES REMAINED DEATHLY SILENT WHILE LABOR'S TRIUMPHANT ROAR SURGED

AROUND THE SLIGHT, PALE PRIME MINISTER . FIRMER GROUND . HE WENT ON

MANFULLY, BUT AGAIN AND AGAIN LABOR'S UPROARIOUS BARRACKING SILENCED

HIM FOR PAINFUL SECONDS AT A TIME . HE WADED THROUGH THE UNFAMILIAR

MARSHES OF ECONOMICS, FINALLY REACHED FIRMER GROUND WHEN HE TURNED TO

FOREIGN POLICY . STARING COLDLY AT WILSON, WHO WANTS TO ABANDON

BRITAIN'S INDEPENDENT DETERRENT, SIR ALEC DECLARED THAT HE INTENDS TO

MAKE THIS A CENTRAL ISSUE OF THE CAMPAIGN . ONCE BRITAIN RENOUNCES

NUCLEAR ARMS, HE WARNED, " WE COULD NEVER GO BACK INTO THIS BUSINESS .

THE GOVERNMENT MEANS TO RETAIN NUCLEAR FORCES UNDER OUR OWN CONTROL, "

ADDING THAT WITHOUT THEM " WE WOULD NO LONGER HAVE A PLACE AT THE PEACE

TABLE AS OF RIGHT . " THE CUBAN CRISIS, HE SAID, FORCED RUSSIA TO "

MODIFY ITS TACTICS, " BUT " THE COMMUNIST AIM IS CLEARLY STILL

UNCHANGED . IT IS TO DESTROY OUR WAY OF LIFE . " IN COLD TYPE NEXT DAY,

HIS SPEECH READ CREDITABLY ENOUGH . BUT ON BOTH SIDES OF THE HOUSE

THERE WAS AGREEMENT THAT THE PRIME MINISTER'S EAGERLY AWAITED COMMONS

DEBUT HAD BEEN A DISAPPOINTING PERFORMANCE .

HE SAT IN THE COMMONS FROM 1931 TO 1945 AS M.P

. FOR SOUTH LANARK, WAS RE-ELECTED IN 1950 BUT WENT TO THE LORDS AFTER

SUCCEEDING TO THE 14TH EARLDOM OF HOME IN 1951 .

WEST GERMANY REMEMBRANCE TWO SPECTERS ROSE TO REMIND GERMANS OF

EVENTS THAT TOOK PLACE A QUARTER CENTURY AND MORE AGO, BUT HAD STILL

THE POWER TO EVOKE DEEP EMOTIONS . REICHSTAG REVIVED . IN WEST BERLIN,

THE REICHSTAG ONCE AGAIN BECAME HABITABLE . A HUGE, FLORID STRUCTURE OF

SILESIAN SANDSTONE SINCE 1894 THE HOME OF WHATEVER DEMOCRACY GERMANY

KNEW FROM THE DAYS OF BISMARCK THROUGH THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC THE BUILDING

HAD BULKED VACANT AND LIFELESS EVER SINCE IT WAS GUTTED BY FIRE ON FEB

. 27, 1933 . THE NAZIS CLAIMED THE FIRE WAS KINDLED BY COMMUNISTS AS

THE SIGNAL FOR A RED UPRISING, AND A CONFUSED DUTCH BOY NAMED MARINUS

VAN DER LUBBE WAS BEHEADED FOR HIS ALLEGED PART IN THE CRIME . SINCE

THE REICHSTAG FIRE GAVE HITLER A PRETEXT TO GAIN COMPLETE CONTROL OF

GERMANY, MOST HISTORIANS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE FIRE WAS SET BY THE

NAZIS THEMSELVES, POSSIBLY EVEN BY HERMANN GORING IN PERSON . THE

REICHSTAG WAS FURTHER DAMAGED BY ALLIED BOMBERS AND BY SHELLFIRE IN THE

CLOSING DAYS OF WORLD WAR II . THOUGH MANY GERMANS THOUGHT THAT IT

SHOULD REMAIN IN RUINS AS A REMINDER OF THE PAST SLOW RECONSTRUCTION

WORK WAS BEGUN IN 1958 . BY LAST WEEK THE SOUTH WING, CONTAINING 45

OFFICES, SEVEN CONFERENCE ROOMS AND A PRESIDENTIAL SUITE, WAS FORMALLY

REOPENED . IT WILL TAKE ABOUT FOUR MORE YEARS AND AN ADDITIONAL $12.5

MILLION TO COMPLETELY RESTORE THE REICHSTAG . UNANSWERED, SO FAR, IS

THE QUESTION OF WHO WILL OCCUPY IT AND WHY . THE BUNDESTAG IS UNLIKELY

TO LEAVE BONN FOR BERLIN FOR FEAR OF BRINGING CRIES OF " PROVOCATION "

FROM RUSSIA . MOST LIKELY, THE RECONSTRUCTED REICHSTAG WILL STAND EMPTY

THROUGH THE YEARS, SERVING WEST GERMANY AND WEST BERLIN AS A MUTE

SYMBOL OF THE HOPE OF EVENTUAL REUNIFICATION OF THE NATION .

KRISTALLNACHT MOURNED . ALL OVER WEST GERMANY, CEREMONIES MARKED THE

25TH ANNIVERSARY OF KRISTALLNACHT (NIGHT OF CRYSTAL), WHEN HITLER'S

STORM TROOPERS WENT ON A NATIONWIDE RAMPAGE AGAINST THE PROPERTY,

DIGNITY AND LIFE OF THE 400,000 JEWS WHO HAD NOT YET FLED THEIR GERMAN

HOMELAND . SYNAGOGUES WERE PUT TO THE TORCH . THOUSANDS OF JEWISH

STORES WERE PLUNDERED AND HAD THEIR WINDOWS SMASHED (HENCE THE NIGHT'S

BITTER NICKNAME) . THIRTY-SIX JEWS WERE MURDERED AND 25,000 ARRESTED .

THE POGROM HAD BEEN INSPIRED BY THE ASSASSINATION OF GERMAN DIPLOMAT

ERNST VOM RATH IN PARIS BY A 17-YEAR-OLD STATELESS JEW NAMED HERSHEL

GRYNSZPAN. IT WAS, JOSEPH GOEBBELS TOLD HITLER, A PROPAGANDA

OPPORTUNITY EQUAL TO THAT OF THE REICHSTAG FIRE . HITLER AGREED, AND

THE STORM TROOPERS WERE RELEASED FOR THEIR " SPONTANEOUS " ACTION,

WHILE REGULAR POLICE TURNED THEIR BACKS . BOTH GERMAN TELEVISION

NETWORKS LAST WEEK FILLED THEIR PEAK VIEWING HOURS WITH PROGRAMS

MERCILESSLY REMINDING GERMANS OF WHAT THEY HAD ALLOWED TO HAPPEN .

LEADING NEWSPAPERS DEVOTED ENTIRE PAGES TO RECOLLECTING IN DETAIL THE

HORRORS OF KRISTALLNACHT . SAID CHANCELLOR LUDWIG ERHARD : " WE MOURN

WITH THE SURVIVORS AND WITH JEWRY IN THE ENTIRE WORLD . NO MAN CAN MAKE

UP FOR THE INJUSTICE THAT WAS DONE . " ON TOUR IN AFRICA, WEST BERLIN'S

MAYOR WILLY BRANDT SENT GREETINGS TO A MEMORIAL SERVICE HELD AT THE

REBUILT JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER ON BERLIN'S FASANENSTRASSE . THERE,

HEINZ GALINSKI, THE LEADER OF THE CITY'S 6,000 REMAINING JEWS (DOWN

FROM 160,500 IN 1933), HANDED OUT AWARDS TO " UNSUNG HEROES OF THE NAZI

ERA, " 44 GERMANS WHO HAD RISKED DEATH TO GIVE SHELTER AND PROTECTION

TO JEWS .

IRONICALLY, IT WAS DISCOVERED AFTER HIS DEATH THAT

DIPLOMAT VOM RATH HAD BEEN AN ACTIVE ANTI-NAZI . YOUNG GRYNSZPAN WAS

FOUND GUILTY OF MANSLAUGHTER BY A FRENCH COURT AND SENTENCED TO 20

YEARS IN PRISON . HE WAS SERVING HIS TERM AT SANTE PRISON WHEN THE

NAZIS OCCUPIED ALL OF FRANCE, AND HIS ULTIMATE FATE IS STILL UNKNOWN .

JAPAN TWO PINS JAPAN'S DISASTER TOLL LAST WEEK STOOD AT 450 IN

THE KYUSHU MINE EXPLOSION, AND 162 IN THE THREE-TRAIN WRECK NEAR

YOKOHAMA . AS FAR AS ANYONE COULD DETERMINE, BOTH TRAGEDIES RESULTED

FROM FAULTY COTTER PINS, ONLY AN INCH OR TWO LONG . AT THE MIKAWA MINE

ON SOUTHERN KYUSHU ISLAND, A COTTER PIN APPARENTLY FELL OUT OF A

COUPLING ON A STRING OF COAL CARS HALTED ON A SLIGHT INCLINE . ONE COAL

CAR ROLLED BACK DOWN INTO THE MINE . GATHERING SPEED, IT FLEW OFF THE

TRACK ON A CURVE IN THE TUNNEL AND STRUCK THE MINE WALL, SHOWERING THE

FATAL SPARKS THAT IGNITED COAL DUST IN A VAST EXPLOSION . AT TSURUMI,

OUTSIDE YOKOHAMA, ANOTHER COTTER PIN EVIDENTLY SHEARED OFF THE WHEEL

HOUSING OF A SOUTHBOUND FREIGHT CAR . THE LOOSE LOST WHEEL CAUSED THE

LAST THREE CARS TO DERAIL AND SPRAWL ACROSS THE ADJACENT TRACK .

SECONDS LATER, ALERTED BY A WARNING FLARE, A PASSENGER TRAIN SOUTHBOUND

FROM TOKYO HALTED ON A CLEAR TRACK BESIDE THE FREIGHT . AT THAT MOMENT,

A NORTHBOUND COMMUTER TRAIN ROARED UP THE MIDDLE TRACK . THE LOCOMOTIVE

CRASHED INTO THE DERAILED FREIGHT CARS, DID A RIGHT ANGLE FLIP AND

SLICED THROUGH THE FIFTH AND SIX COACHES OF THE PASSENGER TRAIN . THE

FIRST RESCUERS RECOILED FROM THE CARNAGE . RECALLED ONE : " THERE WERE

BODIES PILED FOUR TO SIX DEEP . THERE WERE LEGS, ARMS AND HEADS TORN

OFF, ALL BLOODY, SCATTERED EVERYWHERE . IT WAS A HORRIBLE HUMAN VERSION

OF A DOLL REPAIR SHOP . " WITH NATIONAL ELECTIONS BEING HELD THIS WEEK,

THE SOCIALIST OPPOSITION HURRIEDLY TRIED TO MAKE POLITICAL CAPITAL OF

THE TRAGEDIES . AN OFFICIAL SOCIALIST STATEMENT BLAMED THE GOVERNMENT,

WHICH OPERATES THE RAILWAYS, AND THE PRIVATE OWNERS OF THE MINE FOR "

HAVING PLACED TOO MUCH EMPHASIS ON EFFICIENCY AND PROFIT AND NOT ENOUGH

ON THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF PASSENGERS AND EMPLOYEES . " THE MINE

OWNERS, WHO USED TO BOAST TO FOREIGN VISITORS THAT THE MIKAWA WAS AN "

UNDERGROUND PALACE, " COULD HAVE RETORTED THAT GOVERNMENT INSPECTORS

HAD FOUND MIKAWA TO BE AMONG THE BESTEQUIPPED MINES IN THE COUNTRY .

THE GOVERNMENT COULD POINT OUT THAT THE STRETCH OF TRACK WHERE THE

COLLISION OCCURRED WAS EQUIPPED WITH MODERN SAFETY DEVICES BUT THEY

PROVED USELESS BECAUSE THE ENTIRE CHAIN OF EVENTS, FROM THE DERAILMENT

OF THE FREIGHT CARS TO THE ARRIVAL OF THE THIRD TRAIN, TOOK LESS THAN

30 SECONDS . FEW JAPANESE HAD HEART TO ENTER THE ARGUMENT ; THEY WERE

TOO BUSY BURYING THE DEAD AND WORRYING

ABOUT THE SURVIVORS . OF THE 274 HOSPITALIZED MINERS, AN ALARMING 100

WERE SUFFERING FROM AMNESIA . AS TRAFFIC RESUMED ON THE TOKYO-YOKOHAMA

LINE, THE TRAINS MOVED SLOWLY PAST TSURUMI AND SOBBING PASSENGERS

DROPPED BOUQUETS AT THE ACCIDENT SPOT . RAILWAY WORKERS COLLECTED THE

FLOWERS AND REVERENTLY ARRANGED THEM ON AN EMBANKMENT BESIDE THE TRACK

WHEREVER MONARCHS STILL RULED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, IN JORDAN FORMAL

COURT MOURNING WAS PROCLAIMED . HARDLY A NATION IN THE WORLD FAILED TO

ORDER THE RITES OF TOLLING BELLS AND LOWERED FLAGS . THEATERS AND

SPORTS ARENAS CLOSED DOWN ON INDIVIDUAL IMPULSE . WITH THE NEWS OF

KENNEDY'S DEATH, A VIENNESE ICE SHOW HALTED IN MID-PERFORMANCE ; IN

BELGIUM, A SIX-DAY BICYCLE RACE WAS INTERRUPTED ; IN DISTANT NEPAL,

THE CEREMONIAL OPENING OF A LEPROSARIUM WAS POSTPONED . EVERYWHERE,

BARS, CAFES AND RESTAURANTS EMPTIED LONG BEFORE CLOSING TIME .

STRANGERS SPOKE TO EACH OTHER IN SHORT, SIMPLE PHRASES " POOR JACKIE, "

OR " HOW AWFUL, " OR " IT CAN'T BE TRUE . " THE PHONES OF AMERICANS

ABROAD NEVER CEASED RINGING, AS FOREIGN FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES OR

EVEN TOTAL STRANGERS CALLED TO OFFER SYMPATHY . THE STREETS IN FRONT OF

U.S . EMBASSIES WERE JAMMED WITH MOURNERS WHO STOOD IN LINE FOR HOURS

TO WRITE THEIR NAMES IN BOOKS OF CONDOLENCE . SOME BROUGHT FLOWERS, BUT

MANY SEARCHED OUT AN AMERICAN DIPLOMAT MERELY TO SHAKE HIS HAND .

MONSTROUS ACT . ONE BY ONE THE STATESMEN JOINED THE CHORUS OF

COMMISERATION . AS BIG BEN TOLLED EVERY MINUTE FOR ONE HOUR (A GESTURE

NORMALLY RESERVED FOR DEATHS IN THE ROYAL FAMILY), PRIME MINISTER SIR

ALEC DOUGLAS-HOME SAID : " THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THE MIND AND THE HEART

STAND STILL . " FROM SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL CAME A STATEMENT : " THIS

MONSTROUS ACT HAS TAKEN FROM US A GREAT STATESMAN AND A WISE AND

VALIANT MAN . " THE WORDS STILL SEEMED TO CARRY THE OLD, SIBILANT

INDIGNATION OF THE ANCIENT LION . LIBERIA'S PRESIDENT WILLIAM TUBMAN

CABLED : " THE URN OF GRIEF HAS BEEN OPENED AND IS BEING FILLED WITH

THE TEARS OF FRIENDS THE WORLD OVER . " ISRAEL'S DAVID BEN-GURION ONLY

ASKED : " WHY, WHY ? " ALMOST BY REFLEX, PEOPLE RUSHED TO DISCLAIM

EVEN REMOTE COMPLICITY IN THE MURDER . " THANK GOD IT WASN'T A NEGRO, "

SAID A NEGRO IN TORONTO . MANY OTHERS INSISTED ON READING INTO THE

EVENT THEIR OWN POLITICAL PASSIONS . STATESMEN IN AFRICA, ASIA AND

ELSEWHERE INSISTED THAT THE DEED MUST HAVE BEEN DONE BY A RACIST, AND

THAT KENNEDY WAS A MARTYR LIKE LINCOLN OR GANDHI . AND NEHRU COULD NOT

RESIST REMARKING THAT THE MURDER GAVE EVIDENCE OF " DARK CORNERS IN THE

U.S., AND THIS GREAT TRAGEDY IS A SLAP FOR THE CONCEPT OF DEMOCRACY . "

GOLDEN BOY . THE MOURNING VOICES FIRST OF ALL WERE FOR THE PRESIDENT OF

THE UNITED STATES, REGARDLESS OF HIS NAME OR IDENTITY . FOR IN A SENSE

FAR BEYOND DAILY FOREIGN POLICY SQUABBLES, HE IS TO MUCH OF THE WORLD

THE PROTECTOR OF THE WEAK, THE BENEFACTOR OF THE POOR . BECAUSE OF THE

CHANGES IN THE COLD WAR CLIMATE THAT OCCURRED DURING HIS

ADMINISTRATION, MILLIONS, EVEN ON THE ENEMY SIDE, MOURNED JOHN KENNEDY

AS A MAN OF PEACE . BUT ABOVE ALL THEY MOURNED HIM FOR HIS PERSON .

PERHAPS EVEN MORE THAN HIS OWN COUNTRYMEN, OTHER PEOPLES SAW IN HIM THE

EMBODIMENT OF AMERICAN VIRTUES YOUTH, STRENGTH, INFORMALITY, GOOD

LOOKS, THE IDEALISTIC BELIEF THAT ALL PROBLEMS CAN EVENTUALLY BE SOLVED

. A SOUTHERN RHODESIAN PAPER CALLED HIM " THE GOLDEN BOY, " AND COMMON

MARKET PRESIDENT WALTER HALLSTEIN SAID THAT KENNEDY " PERSONIFIED THE

MOST BEAUTIFUL QUALITIES OF HIS PEOPLE . " POSSIBLY MORE THAN ANY OTHER

PRESIDENT IN U.S . HISTORY, HE HAD SET OUT TO CHARM THE WORLD, AND HE

HAD SUCCEEDED IN CONVINCING MANY A NATION THAT IT WAS HIS SPECIAL

FAVORITE .

IT WAS THE SAME IN ASIA . IN THAILAND,

AUTHORITIES SENT SOUND TRUCKS INTO THE VILLAGES TO SPREAD THE MOURNFUL

NEWS THAT PRATHANATHIBODI (PRESIDENT) KENNEDY WAS DEAD . IN SAIGON,

PEOPLE WERE MORE SHOCKED BY KENNEDY'S DEATH THAN THEY HAD BEEN BY THAT

OF PRESIDENT DIEM ; AND BUDDHISTS HELD SPECIAL MEMORIAL SERVICES AND

PRAYERS . IN JAPAN, TECHNICIANS WERE UP BEFORE DAWN TO RECEIVE THE

HISTORIC FIRST TRANS-PACIFIC TV BROADCAST FROM THE U.S., WHICH WAS TO

HAVE INCLUDED A PERSONAL MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT . INSTEAD, THE

VOICE OF A JAPANESE NEWSMAN IN MANHATTAN REPORTED THE NEWS OF KENNEDY'S

DEATH . IN ALL OF ASIA, RED CHINA WAS ALMOST ALONE IN ITS DETERMINED

LACK OF SYMPATHY . PEKING RADIO CARRIED THE KENNEDY STORY WITHOUT

COMMENT . THE HONG KONG COMMUNIST NEW EVENING POST SNEERED THAT KENNEDY

HAD " USED A TWO-FACED POLICY TO PROMOTE AN IMPERIALIST WAR COURSE . "

VANISHING BAITERS . EVEN CUBA PROVED LESS SURLY THAN RED CHINA . FIDEL

CASTRO DEPLORED THE MURDER, SAID HE HAD NO REASON TO WISH FOR KENNEDY'S

DEATH, BUT CONCEDED THAT " PERHAPS " CUBA MIGHT HAVE HAD MOTIVES " TO

FEEL LIKE IT " AND VAGUELY SUGGESTED THAT " REACTIONARIES " WERE REALLY

TO BLAME . ELSEWHERE IN LATIN AMERICA, ALL THE YANKEE BAITING SEEMED TO

DISAPPEAR FOR THE MOMENT . A SENSE OF PESSIMISM ABOUT THE FUTURE

GRIPPED BRAZIL, AND THE DOWNTOWN STREETS OF RIO DE JANEIRO WERE FILLED

WITH PEOPLE WHOSE TIGHT FACES, GLAZED EYES AND UNACCUSTOMED SILENCE

REVEALED THEIR FEELINGS . IN THE FAVELAS (SHANTYTOWNS) ON RIO'S

OUTSKIRTS, SAMBA BANDS CALLED OFF THEIR REHEARSALS FOR THE CARNIVAL,

AND PRESIDENT JOAO GOULART SAID ABOUT KENNEDY : " I KNEEL BEFORE HIS

MEMORY . " THE MOST ELOQUENT LATIN AMERICAN VOICES WERE THOSE HEARD IN

THE STREET . A JANITOR IN QUITO, WHO HAD BEEN LISTENING TO THE NEWS ON

RADIO, REFUSED TO READ HIS NEWSPAPER BECAUSE " IT'S TOO PAINFUL TO GO

OVER SUCH A SAD STORY AGAIN . " DESPITE LATER REVELATIONS ABOUT THE

CRIME, MOST LATIN AMERICANS PERSISTED IN BELIEVING THAT KENNEDY HAD

BEEN SLAIN BECAUSE OF HIS SUPPORT FOR NEGRO RIGHTS . IN BUENOS AIRES,

WOMEN CRIED, " QUE BARBARIDAD ! " , AND OLD MEN MADE SAD, FUTILE

GESTURES WITH THEIR HANDS . SAID ONE GRIEVING COLOMBIAN : " IT SEEMS

AS THOUGH ALL THE PRESIDENTS IN ALL THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES HAVE

HARRY FELT'S REINFORCED CONCRETE COMMAND POST HIGH ABOVE PEARL HARBOR,

TOP U.S . OFFICIALS LAST WEEK GATHERED FOR THE FIRST EXHAUSTIVE POLICY

STUDY OF SOUTH VIET NAM SINCE THE COUP THAT TOPPLED THE DIEM REGIME THE

NINE-HOUR CONFERENCE SECRETARY OF STATE DEAN RUSK, DEFENSE SECRETARY

ROBERT MCNAMARA AND JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF CHAIRMAN MAXWELL TAYLOR HAD

FLOWN IN FROM WASHINGTON ; FROM SAIGON CAME AMBASSADOR HENRY CABOT

LODGE AND GENERAL PAUL HARKINS . THE HONOLULU MEETING EXUDED ALMOST

RELENTLESS OPTIMISM ABOUT THE WAR, AND THE POLICYMAKERS CLUNG BRAVELY

TO THE LINE THAT THINGS SHOULD BE SUFFICIENTLY IN HAND BY 1965 TO

PERMIT COMPLETE WITHDRAWAL OF THE 16,500 AMERICAN TROOPS . JUST IN TIME

. ONE OF THE FEW CONCRETE DECISIONS LEAKED FROM THE CONFERENCE WAS A

HARDLY SURPRISING AGREEMENT TO INTENSIFY ANTI-GUERRILLA OPERATIONS IN

SOUTH VIET NAM'S RICE BOWL, A WEDGE-SHAPED SECTION OF THE MEKONG DELTA

FROM SAIGON SOUTH, WHERE ONE-THIRD OF THE POPULATION IS CONCENTRATED

AND THE VIET CONG IS STRONGEST . ANOTHER DECISION : TO REVISE THE

GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGIC HAMLET PROGRAM . ALL TOO OFTEN IN THE PAST ,

RELUCTANT PEASANTS WERE HERDED INTO BLEAK " FORTIFIED " VILLAGES THAT

WERE IN FACT INSUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO HASTILY

BUILT . MEANWHILE THE RED GUERRILLAS, WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO BE STARVING

IN THE NO MAN'S LAND OUTSIDE THE HAMLETS, MANAGED TO LIVE WELL ENOUGH

OFF THE LAND . HENCEFORTH, THE PLAN IS TO SEE THAT ALL EXISTING

VILLAGES ARE REALLY DEFENSIBLE AND MORE PLEASANT TO LIVE IN, WITH

SCHOOLS AND DISPENSARIES . AS THE CONFERENCE ADJOURNED, THE WAR IN

SOUTH VIET NAM WAS PROCEEDING FITFULLY . NEW, AGGRESSIVE COMMANDERS

REPORTED SEVERAL SUCCESSFUL ATTACKS AGAINST THE GUERRILLAS, BUT IN THE

DELTA THE COMMUNISTS STILL SEEMED TO HAVE THE INITIATIVE . VIETNAMESE

OFFICERS AND MANY OF THEIR U.S . ADVISERS CLAIM THAT BECAUSE OF DIEM'S

MILITARY MISMANAGEMENT, THE COUP CAME JUST IN TIME TO KEEP THE

COMMUNISTS FROM GAINING COMPLETE CONTROL OF TWO DISPUTED PROVINCES

CLOSE TO SAIGON . THIS MAY OR MAY NOT BE TRUE, BUT THE ARGUMENT OFFERS

A BUILT-IN CHANCE TO BLAME DIEM LATER, IN CASE THINGS SHOULD GO

SERIOUSLY WRONG . NO MORE SIESTAS . IN SAIGON, LIEUT . GENERAL DUONG

VAN ( " BIG " ) MINH, THE HEAD OF THE RULING MILITARY JUNTA, RODE ABOUT

ALMOST UNNOTICED IN A BLACK CITROEN (IN CONTRAST TO DIEM'S VAST

MOTORCADES), VISITING A FEW GOVERNMENT OFFICES AND MILITARY UNITS . HE

ALSO OPENED PROMISING NEGOTIATIONS WITH VIETNAMESE SECTS THAT HAD

WITHDRAWN SUPPORT FROM DIEM BUT WERE NOT READY TO RALLY TO THE NEW

REGIME . BUT WHILE STILL CLEARLY FAVORED BY THE POPULATION, THE NEW

REGIME SEEMED ODDLY RELUCTANT TO ASSUME POLITICAL LEADERSHIP . ONE OF

ITS FEW DECISIONS : TO ABOLISH THE SIESTA THAT HAS TRADITIONALLY

CLOSED GOVERNMENT OFFICES FOR 2F HOURS EACH AFTERNOON . DESPITE THE

MOURNFUL YAWNS OF CIVIL SERVANTS, THE NEW DECREE ENABLES PEASANTS AND

RURAL OFFICIALS TO COMPLETE THEIR BUSINESS IN THE CAPITAL EARLIER AND

RETURN HOME SAFELY BEFORE DUSK, WHEN THE VIET CONG START HARASSING

CAMBODIA " BALANCE OF MENACES " A CHUBBY LITTLE MAN IN A DARK

BLUE SUIT STRODE INTO THE SPORTS STADIUM OF THE STEAMY CAMBODIAN

CAPITAL OF PNOMPENH (PRONOUNCED NOM-PEN) LAST WEEK, MOUNTED THE

PLATFORM, AND BEGAN HARANGUING THE ASSEMBLED CROWD IN A WHINY,

HIGH-PITCHED VOICE . THE SPEAKER WAS PRINCE NORODOM SIHANOUK,

NEUTRALIST, MERCURIAL RULER OF CAMBODIA, AND HE HAD CALLED THE RALLY TO

ANNOUNCE IN EFFECT THAT THE U.S . WAS WORKING TO UNDERMINE HIS REGIME .

TURNING THEATRICALLY TO THE THRONG, SIHANOUK ASKED WHETHER THE NATIONAL

HONOR DID NOT DEMAND THAT CAMBODIA REJECT ANY FUTURE HELP FROM THE

AMERICANS . WHEN HIS SUBJECTS ROARED OBEDIENT APPROVAL, THE PRINCE

ORDERED : " SO BE IT . " SIHANOUK MIGHT CHANGE HIS MIND AGAIN, AS HE

HAS BEFORE . IN A FORMAL NOTE TO WASHINGTON, HE CALLED FOR A HALT TO

ALL AMERICAN ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AID, WHICH IN THE PAST EIGHT YEARS

HAS AMOUNTED TO $366 MILLION . AND SO THE U.S . ALREADY STRIVING TO

SAVE WAR-TORN SOUTH VIET NAM AND " NEUTRAL " BUT TOTTERING LAOS FROM

THE REDS FACED ANOTHER MESS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA . SHAKEN NEIGHBOR . WHAT

WAS AILING THE PRINCE ? A SUSPICIOUS, EMOTIONAL, FRENCH-EDUCATED

DESCENDANT OF CAMBODIA'S MEDIEVAL KHMER KINGS, HE ONCE PERFORMED

SLAPSTICK PARTS IN MOVIES (WHICH HE PRODUCED HIMSELF) AND HAS OFTEN

PLAYED SLAPSTICK POLITICS . FRIENDS SERIOUSLY REPORTED LAST WEEK THAT

TWO CONTRIBUTING REASONS FOR SIHANOUK'S BAD MOOD MIGHT BE THAT 1) HE

HAD BEEN CRASH-DIETING TO LOSE 15 LBS . IN TEN DAYS, AND 2) THE U.S .

TRANSFERRED A FORMER MILITARY ADVISORY CHIEF WITH WHOM THE PRINCE

ENJOYED PLAYING VOLLEYBALL . THE PRINCE HIMSELF ACCUSED THE U.S . OF

SUPPORTING A CLANDESTINE RADIO, ON SOUTH VIET NAM SOIL, RUN BY THE

PRINCE'S POLITICAL OPPOSITION (THE U.S . DENIED THE CHARGE) .

BUT, ABOVE ALL, THE

PRINCE TALKS OF THE " INEVITABILITY " OF COMMUNIST CHINA'S TAKEOVER OF

SOUTHEAST ASIA, HENCE MAY BE TRYING TO SAVE HIMSELF BY COZYING UP TO

THE RED DRAGON . WHAT PRECIPITATED HIS LATEST PERFORMANCE COULD WELL

HAVE BEEN THE OVERTHROW AND ASSASSINATION OF HIS LATE NEIGHBOR, SOUTH

VIET NAM'S NGO DINH DIEM . ALTHOUGH SIHANOUK AND DIEM WERE BITTER

ENEMIES, THE PRINCE WAS SHAKEN BY DIEM'S DEATH AND ATTRIBUTED IT TO THE

CUTOFF OF DIEM'S AMERICAN AID . POSSIBLY DETERMINED NEVER TO GET

HIMSELF ON THE SAME VULNERABLE SPOT, SIHANOUK MOVED QUICKLY TO LESSEN

HIS DEPENDENCE ON THE U.S . OPENING TO THE SEINE . FOR ALL HIS

ECCENTRIC BEHAVIOR, SIHANOUK HAS ALSO SOMETIMES PROVED HIMSELF A SHREWD

POLITICIAN . SINCE INDEPENDENCE FROM FRANCE TEN YEARS AGO, HE HAS

JAILED HOME-GROWN COMMUNISTS AND WOOED HIS RED-HOT YOUNG LEFTIST

CRITICS INTO THE GOVERNMENT WHILE AT THE SAME TIME MAINTAINING WARM

RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA AND RED CHINA . SIHANOUK LAST WEEK PERFORMED

ANOTHER TYPICALLY SLIPPERY GYRATION . INSTEAD OF RUSHING RIGHT INTO

PEKING'S ARMS, HE TURNED TO HIS OLD COLONIAL TUTOR, FRANCE, AND ASKED

HER TO HELP REPLACE U.S . AID . SAID THE PRINCE : " FOR OUR COUNTRY,

LIBERATED FROM THE U.S . AND WHICH THE COMMUNIST POWERS DO NOT WISH TO

TAKE IN CHARGE, IT COULD BE THE HOUR OF FRANCE . " THE INVITATION WAS

ANOTHER POTENTIAL OPENING FOR CHARLES DE GAULLE, WHO WANTS TO WHEEL AND

DEAL IN THE AREA OF FRANCE'S OLD INDO-CHINA EMPIRE (HE KEEPS SUGGESTING

A " NEUTRALIZED " VIET NAM, HINTED LAST WEEK THAT FRANCE MAY ESTABLISH

DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH COMMUNIST NORTH VIET NAM) . BUT WHETHER PARIS

WILL FILL THE GAP TO BE LEFT BY THE ELIMINATION OF A $30 MILLION ANNUAL

U.S . DOLE REMAINS TO BE SEEN . FRANCE HAS BEEN SUPPLYING CAMBODIA ONLY

ONE TENTH THE U.S.'S CONTRIBUTION, MOSTLY TO MAINTAIN A 300-MAN FORCE

TRAINING THE CAMBODIAN ARMY .

AT WEEK'S END THE PRINCE

CLIMAXED HIS PERPLEXING THEATRICS BY CALLING IN THE PRESS CORPS,

DELIVERING A MEANDERING MONOLOGUE INTERSPERSED WITH GIGGLES . PROUDLY,

HE ANNOUNCED THAT RED CHINA HAD OFFERED HIM MILITARY SUPPORT . " I

THINK I HAVE ACHIEVED A BALANCE OF MENACES, " HE SAID . " THE MENACE OF

THE IMPERIALISTS AND THEIR LACKEYS IS COUNTERBALANCED BY THE MENACE OF

COMMUNIST CHINA, OUR NO . 1 FRIEND . " BUT HE INDICATED THAT HE WOULD

HAVE ONLY FOUR CHINESE CIVILIAN ADVISERS AND NO CHINESE MILITARY

ADVISERS : " EVERYWHERE IN OUR ARMY THERE WILL BE ONLY ONE POWER

HELPING US FRANCE . " ADDED THE PRINCE : " I DO NOT LIKE TO BE A

SATELLITE . I LIKE TO BE FREE . " SERVING CHAMPAGNE ALL AROUND, HE

URGED THE CORRESPONDENTS TO DRINK UP BECAUSE (JOKINGLY REFERRING TO

IMPENDING AUSTERITY) " IN A FEW MONTHS I WON'T BE ABLE TO OFFER

CONGRESS MET IN SECRET TO HEAR THE LATEST WORD ON THE STATUS OF THE

SINO-SOVIET FEUD, AMONG OTHER TOPICS, COMMUNIST CHINA CUT LOOSE WITH

ONE OF ITS MOST SCATHING PERSONAL ATTACKS TO DATE ON NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV

. IN SIMULTANEOUS ARTICLES, RED FLAG AND PEOPLE'S DAILY ACCUSED HIM OF

PARALYZING THE RUSSIAN ARMED FORCES, OF KOWTOWING TO THE CAPITALISTS

AND OF SOUNDING TOO HOLY BY FAR . " IT IS CLEAR, " SAID THE CHINESE,

THAT " IN SPITE OF KHRUSHCHEV'S BIBLE-READING AND PSALMSINGING, U.S .

IMPERIALISTS HAVE NOT BECOME BEAUTIFUL ANGELS . THEY HAVE NOT TURNED

INTO COMPASSIONATE BUDDHAS IN SPITE OF HIS PRAYERS AND INCENSEBURNING .

/ IN SHORT, SAID RED CHINA, KHRUSHCHEV IS " A LAUGHING STOCK . " THE

BLAST MAY WELL OPEN A NEW RIFT BETWEEN MOSCOW AND PEKING, EVEN THOUGH

THE KREMLIN HAS BEEN RELATIVELY RESTRAINED IN RECENT WEEKS . FOR AS

KHRUSHCHEV ONCE ASSERTED : " THERE IS MUCH IN CHRIST THAT IS COMMON

WITH US COMMUNISTS . BUT I CANNOT AGREE WITH HIM WHEN HE SAYS THAT WHEN

YOU ARE HIT ON THE RIGHT CHEEK, TURN THE LEFT CHEEK . IF I AM HIT ON

THE LEFT CHEEK, I HIT BACK ON THE RIGHT CHEEK SO HARD THAT HIS HEAD

MIGHT FALL OFF . /

IRAQ

UNTIL THE NEXT COUP FOR A WHILE LAST WEEK IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL

WHO WAS UP AND WHO WAS DOWN IN IRAQ . PERHAPS THE PRINCIPALS THEMSELVES

WERE NOT SURE . TWO WEEKS AGO, THE BAATH PARTY (TIME, NOV . 22) SEEMED

FIRMLY IN CONTROL . THE COUNTRY'S NON-BAATHIST PRESIDENT, FIELD MARSHAL

ABDUL SALAM AREF, SEEMED A MERE FIGUREHEAD, KEPT ON FOR HIS PRESTIGE

AND POPULARITY . THEN AN INTERNECINE CONFLICT ERUPTED BETWEEN BAATH'S

ANTI-WESTERN, ANTI-BOURGEOIS AND ANTI-AREF RADICAL WING AND A MORE

CONCILIATORY MODERATE FACTION . RUSHING IN FROM NEIGHBORING SYRIA, THE

BAATH PARTY'S HOME BASE, THE PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE UNDER MICHEL AFLAK

APPEARED TO SETTLE THE MATTER BY EXILING THE LEADERS OF THE OPPOSING

FACTIONS . ALTHOUGH SYRIAN-DOMINATED, THE PARTY LEADERS TOOK CHARGE IN

IRAQ, PLACED AREF UNDER PALACE ARREST AND TURNED BAGHDAD OVER TO THE

NATIONAL GUARD, A BAATH-LED OUTFIT FOR WHICH THE REGULAR ARMY HAS

CONTEMPT . WHEN THE BAATH BOSSES OVERCONFIDENTLY RELEASED AREF A FEW

DAYS LATER, HE PROMPTLY JOINED WITH ANGRY FELLOW OFFICERS TO HEAD A

COUP . AT DAWN ONE MORNING LAST WEEK, THE ARMY ATTACKED BAGHDAD WITH

SIX INFANTRY BATTALIONS, SUPPORTED BY ARMOR, ARTILLERY AND JETS .

THOUGH THE NATIONAL GUARD HAD NO HEAVY WEAPONS, THEY FOUGHT

DESPERATELY, LOST HUNDREDS OF MEN . THREE DAYS AFTER THE REVOLT,

BAGHDAD WAS IN AREF'S HANDS . SINCE THE BAATH PARTY IS NASSER'S

ARCHENEMY, THE COUP WAS AT FIRST HAILED IN EGYPT AS PRO-NASSER . IT WAS

ALSO DENOUNCED IN SYRIA AS ANTI-BAATH . BOTH CONCLUSIONS MAY BE

PREMATURE . THE COUP LOOKED MORE LIKE A MILITARY THAN A POLITICAL

AFFAIR, DESIGNED TO PURGE IRAQ OF BAATH ELEMENTS WHO HAD HAD THE

TEMERITY TO DOWNGRADE THE ARMY IN FAVOR OF THE NATIONAL GUARD . THOUGH

HE PACKED THE SYRIAN BAATH LEADERS OFF TO DAMASCUS, AREF INCLUDED IN

HIS NEW CABINET NINE MODERATE BAATHISTS . STILL, THE MIDDLE EAST BEING

WHAT IT IS, AREF MAY WELL JOIN WITH NASSER, AN OLD FRIEND, TO OVERTHROW

THE BAATH LEADERSHIP IN SYRIA . EVEN MORE LIKELY, THE BAATH LEADERSHIP

WILL TRY TO OVERTHROW AREF . JUST ABOUT THE ONLY CERTAINTY IN THE

SITUATION IS THAT THERE IS BOUND TO BE ANOTHER COUP, IN BAGHDAD OR IN

DAMASCUS, IF NOT BOTH .

JAPAN VOTE OF CONFIDENCE FOR IKEDA JAPAN'S NEW ELECTION

REGULATIONS SEVERELY LIMIT CAMPAIGN ACTIVITIES, BUT THE COUNTRY'S

POLITICIANS ARE MASTERS AT CIRCUMVENTING THE RULES . FACED WITH A

$7,000 LIMIT ON CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURES, MANY A CANDIDATE IN LAST WEEK'S

GENERAL ELECTIONS SIMPLY FOLLOWED AN OLD PRACTICE OF HAVING

CONTRIBUTIONS FUNNELED THROUGH " RESEARCH INSTITUTES . " SINCE

CANDIDATES WERE RESTRICTED TO THREE POSTERS EACH (V . THE PREVIOUS

LIMIT OF 12,000), MANY " ACCIDENTALLY " DROPPED CARDS, COMPLETE WITH

PICTURE AND SLOGAN, IN TELEPHONE BOOTHS, DEPARTMENT STORES, BARS AND

BUSES . ON RAINY DAYS, ONE ASPIRANT EVEN HAD HIS CAMPAIGN WORKERS

APPROACH COMMUTERS AND HAND OUT ARMLOADS OF UMBRELLAS ; WHEN THEY WERE

OPENED, THE CANDIDATE'S NAME SPREAD OUT IN HUGE CHARACTERS PAINTED ON

THE UMBRELLA SURFACE . FOR ALL THE UPROAR OVER PROCEDURES, THE ELECTION

AMOUNTED TO AN IMPORTANT VOTE OF CONFIDENCE FOR PRO-CAPITALIST

PRO-WESTERN PREMIER HAYATO IKEDA, 63 . THE SOCIALIST OPPOSITION ZEROED

IN ON THE NAGGING INFLATION THAT HAS ACCOMPANIED JAPAN'S PHENOMENAL

ECONOMIC BOOM . ECONOMIST IKEDA, WHISTLE-STOPPING ACROSS THE NATION,

RETORTED THAT INCOMES HAVE RISEN 52 PER CENT IN THE PAST THREE YEARS,

WHILE PRICES HAVE RISEN ONLY 14 PER CENT . AT A KYOTO RALLY, HE ASKED

: " WHICH DO YOU THINK IS BETTER ? THE SOCIALISTS' ADVOCACY OF

DIVIDING THREE EGGS AMONG FOUR PEOPLE ? OR IKEDA'S POLICY OF DIVIDING

EIGHT EGGS AMONG FOUR PEOPLE ? " ON ELECTION DAY, AMID THE SHRIEK OF

SIRENS THAT REMINDED PEOPLE TO VOTE, IKEDA'S LIBERAL-DEMOCRATIC PARTY

WON CONTROL OF THE 467-SEAT HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES FOR ANOTHER FOUR

YEARS, ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT'S 283-SEAT TOTAL FELL THREE SHORT OF ITS

SHARE IN THE OLD HOUSE . THE SOCIALISTS GAINED SEVEN SEATS FOR A TOTAL

OF 144 . THE MORE MODERATE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS PICKED UP NINE

ADDITIONAL SEATS, FOR A TOTAL OF 23 .

CONGO READING THE RUSSIANS' MAIL A COUPLE OF SOVIET DIPLOMATS

GOT THE KIND OF TREATMENT IN THE CONGO LAST WEEK THAT MANY OTHER

COUNTRIES HAVE OFTEN WISHED BUT NOT DARED TO METE OUT TO RED ENVOYS .

ALMOST FROM THE DAY OF THE CONGO'S INDEPENDENCE IN 1960, THE RUSSIANS

AND THEIR SATELLITES WORKED DOGGEDLY TO DESTROY WHAT LITTLE STABILITY

THE COUNTRY HAD IN HOPES OF GETTING A COMMUNIST FACTION IN CONTROL .

EXPELLED EN MASSE AFTER THE DEMISE OF ERRATIC PATRICE LUMUMBA, THE REDS

BEGAN FILTERING BACK INTO LEOPOLDVILLE LAST YEAR, NOTABLY TO THE

TOWERING EIGHT-STORY APARTMENT BUILDING THAT IS BOTH EMBASSY AND

RESIDENCE FOR SOVIET AMBASSADOR SERGEI NEMCHINA AND HIS 100-MAN STAFF

OF OPERATIVES . TWO OF NEMCHINA'S MOST IMPORTANT AIDES, HIS SLIM, FAIR

EMBASSY COUNSELOR BORIS VORONIN AND STOCKY, BUSHY-HAIRED PRESS ATTACHE

YURI MIAKOTNYKH, HAVE DEVELOPED ESPECIALLY CLOSE CONTACTS WITH

EXTREMISTS OPPOSED TO PREMIER CYRILLE ADOULA'S MODERATE REGIME .

MIAKOTNYKH WORKED HARD TO PENETRATE THE TRADE UNIONS AND LEFTWING

STUDENT GROUPS, EVEN LOBBIED IN THE CORRIDORS OF PARLIAMENT . TUG OF

WAR . WHAT WORRIED THE GOVERNMENT MOST WAS THE CLOSE CONTACT OF THE TWO

RUSSIANS WITH A PLOTTING EXILE GROUP LED BY LUMUMBA'S FORMER PARTY

CHIEF CHRISTOPHE GBENYE, WHO MADE HIS HEADQUARTERS ACROSS THE CONGO

RIVER IN THE EX-FRENCH CONGO CAPITAL OF BRAZZAVILLE . ONE DAY LAST

WEEK, WHEN VORONIN AND MIAKOTNYKH DROVE DOWN TO THE RIVER BANK, KNOWN

AS " LE BEACH, " FOR THE FERRY RIDE OVER TO BRAZZAVILLE, ADOULA'S COPS

DECIDED TO STOP THEM ON THE WAY BACK AND FIND OUT WHAT THEY HAD BEEN UP

TO . SURROUNDING THEIR CAR AT THE LANDING STAGE, CONGOLESE POLICE

INSISTED ON A SEARCH . WITH A SHRUG, THE RUSSIANS OPENED THE TRUNK,

THEN LET THEM LOOK IN THE FRONT AND BACK SEATS . BUT VORONIN WAS

CLEARLY DETERMINED NOT TO GIVE UP HIS BRIEFCASE, AND HUGGED IT TO HIS

CHEST AS HE AND MIAKOTNYKH GOT BACK INTO THE CAR . TO MAKE SURE THE

RUSSIANS DID NOT TRY TO START THE ENGINE AND SPEED AWAY, THE POLICE LET

THE AIR OUT OF THEIR TIRES, THEN PULLED OPEN THE DOORS AND BEGAN A TUG

OF WAR WITH VORONIN'S LEGS, YANKING HIS SHOES OFF IN THE PROCESS . AS

THEY PULLED, MIAKOTNYKH CLUNG JUST AS FIERCELY TO VORONIN, UNTIL AT

LAST, BOTH MEN WERE DRAGGED OUT FEET FIRST, RELIEVED OF THE BRIEFCASE

AND HEAVED UNCEREMONIOUSLY INTO A PICKUP TRUCK . WHEN ONE OF THE

RUSSIANS TRIED TO STUFF A DOCUMENT INSIDE HIS SHIRT, A CONGOLESE GUARD

RIPPED THE ENTIRE FRONT OF HIS SHIRT OFF . OUT IN THE RAIN . WITH THAT,

THE PRISONERS WERE DRIVEN OFF TO A MILITARY CAMP OUTSIDE LEOPOLDVILLE,

AND THE CONTENTS OF VORONIN'S BRIEFCASE WERE TAKEN TO POLICE

HEADQUARTERS . SURE ENOUGH, CLAIMED THE GOVERNMENT, AMONG THEM WAS A

LETTER FROM GBENYE TO THE RUSSIANS ASKING FOR 5 BILLION IN COUNTERFEIT

CONGOLESE FRANCS TO BE USED TO UNDERMINE THE CONGO'S CURRENCY, AND

ANOTHER DOCUMENT REQUESTING ARMS, TAPE RECORDS AND " OTHER ESPIONAGE

EQUIPMENT . " ONE OF THE LETTERS BORE TEETH MARKS, AS IF A RUSSIAN HAD

TRIED TO SWALLOW IT . TO PUT AN ABRUPT STOP TO SUCH SOVIET ACTIVITIES,

SQUADS OF CONGOLESE POLICE WERE RUSHED TO CORDON OFF THE RUSSIANS'

APARTMENTS, AND INSIDE, THE RUSSIANS SUDDENLY DISCOVERED THEMSELVES

WITHOUT TELEPHONE SERVICE AND WITHOUT ELECTRICITY, WHICH MEANT THEY

WOULD HAVE TO SWELTER IN THE HEAT WITHOUT AIR CONDITIONERS AND DO

WITHOUT COOKSTOVES . TWO CZECH DIPLOMATS WHO DROVE UP TO THE GATE WERE

ARRESTED AND FORCED TO STAND OUTSIDE MOST OF THE NIGHT IN A TROPICAL

DOWNPOUR . FROM MOSCOW CAME AN ANGRY DEMAND FOR THE RELEASE OF THE

PRISONERS, WHO, ACCORDING TO IZVESTIA, HAD BEEN ARRESTED BY POLICE LED

BY " AMERICAN ADVISERS . " IGNORING THE PROTEST, ADOULA'S AGENTS NEXT

MORNING SWOOPED DOWN ON THE HOTEL ROOM OF ANOTHER SUSPECTED COMMUNIST

TROUBLEMAKER, THE NEWLY ARRIVED CORRESPONDENT OF THE SOVIET NEWS AGENCY

NOVISTI, HUSTLED HIM OFF TO A CELL . HE WAS LATER RELEASED, BUT BY

WEEK'S END, THE TWO RUSSIAN DIPLOMATS WERE PUT ABOARD EUROPE-BOUND

PLANES . USUALLY HESITANT PREMIER ADOULA REJECTED HIS CABINET'S

RECOMMENDATION THAT DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA AND CZECHOSLOVAKIA

BE SEVERED . BUT HE DID ORDER AMBASSADOR NEMCHINA TO GET OUT OF THE

CONGO WITHIN 24 HOURS AND TAKE THE ENTIRE 100-MAN STAFF WITH HIM .

SOUTH AFRICA WHOSE COUNTRY ? FOR A NATION DEDICATED TO WHITE

SUPREMACY, THE VOTING IN SOUTH AFRICA LAST WEEK HAD AN UNACCUSTOMED

LOOK . BLACK WOMEN WITH RED-OCHERED FACES FUMBLED WITH CUMBERSOME

2-FT.-SQ . BALLOTS . THEIR MEN, LOOKING A LITTLE BAFFLED BY THE WHOLE

BUSINESS, STREAMED UP TO REGISTER THEIR VOTES FOR A TRANSKEI PARLIAMENT

. IT WAS THE FIRST STEP IN PRIME MINISTER HENDRIK VERWOERD'S PLAN TO "

SOLVE " SOUTH AFRICA'S RACE PROBLEM : THE FORMATION OF BLACK "

SELF-GOVERNING " REGIONS CALLED BANTUSTANS, WHERE ALL OF SOUTH AFRICA'S

11 MILLION NATIVES, EXCEPT FOR A FEW MILLION NEEDED AS LABOR FOR THE

WHITES, ARE TO BE HERDED INTO REMOTE AND UNDEVELOPED RESERVATIONS .

TRANSKEI, WHERE THE FIRST BANTUSTAN LEGISLATURE WAS BEING DRAWN, IS A

DENMARK-SIZED PLOT OF ROLLING LAND ALONG THE INDIAN OCEAN COAST, WHICH

FOR YEARS HAS BEEN LARGELY IGNORED BY THE WHITES . IT IS FARM LAND THAT

THROUGH BANTU OVERPOPULATION HAS BEEN VICTIM OF OVERGRAZING AND EROSION

. WITHOUT HEAVY CAPITAL INVESTMENT, IT CANNOT SUPPORT MANY ADDITIONAL

PEOPLE . SINCE THE GOLD MINES AND INDUSTRY OF THE WHITE MAN'S ORANGE

FREE STATE AND TRANSVAAL ARE FAR MORE ALLURING, THERE IS PRECIOUS

LITTLE CHANCE OF ANYONE'S INVESTING ANYTHING MUCH IN THE BANTU'S

BOONDOCKS . PREPARING THE ELECTION IN THIS UNPROMISING REGION (SEVEN

OTHER SIMILAR RESERVATIONS ARE PLANNED), VERWOERD'S POLICE FLOCKED INTO

THE TRANSKEI TO SET UP SENTINELS AT EACH OF 1,100 POLLING STATIONS .

AND TO THE ILLITERATE ELECTORATE, WORD HAD ALREADY GONE OUT ABOUT WHICH

CANDIDATES THE GOVERNMENT FAVORED . IRONICALLY, VERWOERD'S CHOICE WAS A

BLACK RACIST NAMED KAIZER MATANZIMA, 48, A SUAVE, HANDSOME ATTORNEY,

WHO SAYS : " ALL THE WHITES MUST LEAVE THE TRANSKEI . THIS IS OUR

COUNTRY . " HIS OPPONENT : WISE, WIZENED PARAMOUNT CHIEF VICTOR POTO,

65, WHO DOES NOT WANT TO SEE THE TRANSKEI'S SMALL (16,000) WHITE

COMMUNITY FORCED OUT, WANTS TO SET UP A MULTIRACIAL REGIME : " I AM

GRATEFUL TO GOD FOR A CHRISTIAN ATTITUDE TO ALL MEMBERS OF THE HUMAN

RACE . " IN ANY CASE, VERWOERD'S WIDELY ADVERTISED SELF-RULE FOR THE

NATIVE REGIONS IS LARGELY HOLLOW, SINCE HIS GOVERNMENT WILL RETAIN

CONTROL OVER THE POLICE, DEFENSE AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS . ALL LEGISLATION

PROPOSED BY THE TRANSKEI'S NEW ALL-BLACK ASSEMBLY WILL FIRST RUN THE

GAUNTLET OF NUMEROUS TAME, GOVERNMENT-APPOINTED CHIEFS, AND AFTER THAT

IS SUBJECT TO THE VETO OF VERWOERD'S OWN OFFICIALS .

GREAT BRITAIN ANOTHER TORY SETBACK DUNDEE, A DOUR, SLUM-RIDDEN

INDUSTRIAL CITY (POP . 182,900) ON SCOTLAND'S EAST COAST, IS FAMED FOR

PARLIAMENT . IN 1959 THE LABOR PARTY ONLY MANAGED TO HANG ONTO DUNDEE

BY 714 VOTES, AND SO, IN LAST WEEK'S BY-ELECTION, THE TORIES HAD HOPES

THAT THE IMPACT OF A NEW, SCOTTISH PRIME MINISTER MIGHT HELP TO DEFEAT

LABOR . INSTEAD, THE GOVERNMENT SUFFERED ANOTHER SETBACK . THE

PROGRESSIVE CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE, A POPULAR LAWYER, LOST TO HIS

LABORITE OPPONENT, A TRADE-UNION OFFICIAL, BY 4,955 VOTES, A TORY DROP

OF 8.8 PER CENT FROM THE LAST GENERAL ELECTION . PART OF THE OUTCOME

WAS CAUSED BY PURELY LOCAL ISSUES (EXAMPLE : RECENT GOVERNMENT

PROPOSALS TO LOWER PROTECTIVE TARIFFS ON JUTE, WHICH WOULD JEOPARDIZE

AN INDUSTRY THAT EMPLOYS 20 PER CENT OF THE CITY'S WORK FORCE), AND THE

LOSS WAS NOT AS SHARP AS THE TORIES' RECENT DEFEAT AT THRIVING,

THE COUNTRY TOGETHER AMIDST THE LINGERING BITTERNESS WITHOUT CURBING

PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY . PROBABLY NO ONE ELSE COULD HAVE DONE IT .

INONU, 80, SEEMED LIKE AN EMBODIMENT OF TURKEY'S PAST : BORN UNDER THE

SULTANATE, HE WAS ONE OF KEMAL ATATURK'S MOST DASHING REVOLUTIONARY

GENERALS, FIRST BECAME PRIME MINISTER IN 1923, SERVED ON AND OFF AS

PREMIER OR PRESIDENT OF TURKEY FOR 40 YEARS . YET LAST WEEK INONU WAS

AGAIN FIGHTING TO SAVE TURKEY FROM NEW POLITICAL TURMOIL . NEW DILEMMA

. INONU AND HIS PEOPLE'S REPUBLICAN PARTY INAUGURATED OVERDUE REFORMS,

BUT THESE DID NOT NECESSARILY MAKE HIM POPULAR . BUREAUCRATS WERE

ANGERED BY HIS CAMPAIGN AGAINST WASTE . BUSINESSMEN AND BIG LANDOWNERS

WERE INCENSED BY NEW SCHEMES TO MAKE THEM PAY TAXES . PLAIN CONSUMERS

WERE MAD AT THE ATTEMPT TO PUT GOVERNMENT MONOPOLIES ON A PROFITMAKING

BASIS, WHICH RAISED PRICES . PEASANTS, WHO STILL WOULD RATHER HAVE NEW

MOSQUES THAN NEW SCHOOLS, HANKERED FOR THE OLD DAYS WHEN MENDERES BUILT

8,000 VILLAGE SHRINES . MENDERES' HEIRS IN THE JUSTICE PARTY KEPT

GAINING GROUND WITH THEIR STRANGE MIXTURE OF AGING LEADERS FOREVER

TROTTING OUT THE GHOST OF THE DEAD LEADER AND YOUNG POLITICIANS FOREVER

PROMISING THAT THEY COULD RUN THINGS MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN INONU . IN

LAST MONTH'S NATIONWIDE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS, INONU WAS PLAINLY

OVERCONFIDENT . WHILE JUSTICE PARTY LEADER RAGIP GUMUSPALA, 66,

CAMPAIGNED STRENUOUSLY, COVERING THOUSANDS OF MILES A WEEK, INONU

LOFTILY LIMITED HIS POLITICKING TO A SINGLE 20-MINUTE RADIO SPEECH .

THE RESULTS GAVE INONU'S REPUBLICANS ONLY 37 PER CENT OF THE VOTE ;

TWO SMALLER PARTIES IN INONU'S SHAKY GOVERNMENT COALITION WERE

VIRTUALLY WIPED OUT . THE WINNER WAS THE JUSTICE PARTY, WITH 46 PER

CENT OF THE BALLOTS . LAST WEEK INONU RESIGNED . HIS DILEMMA : NEITHER

MAJOR PARTY CAN RULE SEPARATELY, SINCE EACH LACKS A PARLIAMENTARY

MAJORITY, AND NEITHER WANTS TO RULE JOINTLY, SINCE THAT EXPERIMENT WAS

TRIED ONCE BEFORE, LASTED SEVEN MONTHS AND ACCOMPLISHED NOTHING . NONE

OF THE SMALLER PARTIES SEEM EAGER TO JOIN ANOTHER COALITION, EITHER .

NEW NATIONAL ELECTIONS ? NOBODY IS ENTHUSIASTIC OVER THAT IDEA . TRY

AGAIN . FOR THE TIME BEING, AT LEAST, THE ARMY WAS STICKING TO ITS

PLEDGE OF POLITICAL NEUTRALITY, BUT NO ONE COULD BE SURE HOW LONG THE

MILITARY WOULD RESIST THE IDEA OF RESTORING " STABILITY " BY STAGING

ANOTHER TAKEOVER . BY WEEK'S END TURKEY'S PRESIDENT, GENERAL CEMAL

GURSEL, CAME TO INONU AND ASKED HIM TO FORM A NEW CABINET ;

CONCEIVABLY, HE MIGHT SUCCEED, BY PERSUADING ONE OF THE SMALL PARTIES

TO JOIN A COALITION AND PICKING UP ENOUGH DEFECTORS ELSEWHERE TO SCRAPE

FOREIGN MINISTER GIUSEPPE SARAGAT . THE NEW CENTER-LEFT COALITION,

OUTGROWTH OF THE APERTURA A SINISTRA (OPENING TO THE LEFT) WHICH

STARTED ALMOST TWO YEARS AGO, LAST WEEK FINALLY MANAGED TO FORM A

CABINET . IN ADDITION TO THE PREMIERSHIP, THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS WOUND

UP WITH 15 OF THE 26 CABINET POSITIONS, INCLUDING THE KEY MINISTRIES OF

DEFENSE, TREASURY, AND INTERNAL AFFAIRS . ALONG WITH THE VICE

PREMIERSHIP, THE LEFT-WING SOCIALISTS GOT FIVE MORE POSTS, THE ONLY

IMPORTANT ONE BEING THE BUDGET MINISTRY . FOUR CABINET JOBS WENT TO THE

SOLIDLY ANTI-COMMUNIST SOCIAL DEMOCRATS (INCLUDING SARAGAT'S FOREIGN

MINISTRY) AND THE MODERATE REPUBLICANS . ITALY'S 25TH CABINET IN 20

YEARS JOINS PARTIES OF DIFFERENT AIMS INTO AN ALLIANCE BASED ON WHAT

EACH SIDE HOPEFULLY TAKES TO BE EXPEDIENCY : THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS

WANT SOCIALIST SUPPORT FOR A FAR-RANGING PACKAGE OF REFORMS ; THE

SOCIALISTS WANT TO EXERCISE POWER AFTER 16 YEARS IN POLITICAL EXILE .

AS ODDLY MATCHED AS THE PARTIES THEMSELVES ARE THEIR TWO LEADERS, FOR

THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE THE KEY POLITICAL FIGURES IN ITALY .

PREMIER ALDO MORO, 47, IS

THE ANTITHESIS OF THE VOLUBLE, EMOTIONAL ITALIAN . A RESERVED ONETIME

LAW PROFESSOR, HE DETESTS THE ACID NAME CALLING OF ITALIAN POLITICS, IS

SO SHY THAT HE OFTEN TRAVELS BY CAR TO AVOID THE NECESSARY SOCIAL

AMENITIES ON PLANES AND TRAINS . MORO'S POLITICAL GENIUS IS FOR

COMPROMISE, SOMETIMES ACHIEVED BY PURE TENACITY . HE ONCE REDUCED A

COLLEAGUE TO NEAR COLLAPSE BY ARGUING REASONABLY FOR FOUR UNINTERRUPTED

HOURS . SO CONSCIENTIOUSLY CAPABLE IS MORO OF SEEING ALL SIDES OF EVERY

QUESTION THAT FRIENDS AND FOES ALIKE ARE CONVINCED THAT HE AGREES ONLY

WITH THEM . MORO'S COLORLESS CAUTION WAS THE VERY QUALITY THAT BOOSTED

HIM TO POLITICAL PROMINENCE . FIVE YEARS AGO, AFTER SHARP-TONGUED

AMINTORE FANFANI QUIT IN A HUFF AS CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC LEADER IN A

DISPUTE OVER HIS THEN STILL HEAVILY OPPOSED PLANS FOR AN OPENING TO THE

LEFT PARTY ELDERS LOOKED FOR A REPLACEMENT . HE HAD TO BE A MAN NOBODY

WAS MAD AT, AND MORO FILLED THE BILL . ALTHOUGH FANFANI LATER BECAME

PREMIER FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS, MORO STAYED ON AS THE PARTY'S CHIEF

STRATEGIST . NO LESS VIGOROUS THAN FANFANI IN HIS ADVOCACY OF THE

CENTER-LEFT ALLIANCE, MORO AT THE SAME TIME WAS MORE MILITANTLY

ANTI-COMMUNIST THAN FANFANI AND THEREFORE PROVED FAR MORE PERSUASIVE

WHEN IT CAME TO SELLING CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS ON THE SCHEME

. PROPHETICALLY, MORO HAD ONCE TRIED TO JOIN THE SOCIALIST PARTY BUT

WAS TURNED DOWN AS BEING " TOO CATHOLIC . " A DEVOUT CHURCHGOER WHO

ATTENDS MASS DAILY, HE WAS BORN IN LECCE IN THE HEEL OF ITALY'S BOOT,

STUDIED LAW AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BARI, AT 24 BEGAN TEACHING . ENTERING

PARLIAMENT IN 1946, THE NEWCOMER WAS NICKNAMED BY HIS COLLEAGUES " THE

QUAKER " BECAUSE OF HIS DOUR OUTLOOK AND AUSTERE HABITS . THROUGH SHEER

DILIGENCE, MORO BECAME UNDER SECRETARY FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS IN 1948,

RECEIVED HIS OWN MINISTRY (JUSTICE) IN 1955 . HOWEVER, HIS SPEECHES AS

A POLITICIAN SOUNDED AS IF HE WERE STILL ADDRESSING LAW STUDENTS AT

BARI, CONTAINED SO MANY PEDANTIC ABSTRACTIONS THAT DECIPHERING HIS

MEANINGS GAVE RISE TO A WHOLE NEW GROUP OF EXPERTS KNOWN AS "

MOROLOGISTS . /

MARRIED, FATHER OF

FOUR DAUGHTERS AND ONE SON, MORO LIVES UNPRETENTIOUSLY IN A

LOWER-MIDDLE-CLASS APARTMENT DISTRICT IN ROME . HIS WIFE, WHO ALMOST

NEVER APPEARS IN PUBLIC WITH HIM, OWNS FEW FANCY FURS OR JEWELS .

OUTSIDE OF HIS FAMILY, MORO'S ONLY NONPOLITICAL PASSION IS FLOWERS,

WHICH HE RAISES AT A SMALL COUNTRY HOUSE ABOUT 30 MILES FROOM ROME . "

THERE, " HE SAYS, " I AM PERFECTLY AT EASE BECAUSE I AM WITH MY

CHILDREN AND MY ROSES . " VICE PREMIER PIETRO NENNI, 72, IS AS

IMPULSIVE AS MORO IS DELIBERATE . WHILE MORO ACHIEVES AGREEMENT THROUGH

PATIENCE, NENNI OFTEN GETS HIS WAY BY SHEER CHARM AND ELOQUENCE . IN

MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY, HIS CAREER HAS FOLLOWED INNUMERABLE TWISTS

AND TURNS . EVEN AS A YOUTH IN ROMAGNA, IN ITALY'S RUGGED NORTH, NENNI

WAS AN ADEPT AT POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY . AFTER HIS PEASANT PARENTS DIED,

HE WAS PLACED IN AN ORPHANAGE BY AN ARISTOCRATIC FAMILY . EVERY SUNDAY

NENNI RECITED HIS CATECHISM BEFORE THE COUNTESS AND IF HE DID WELL

RECEIVED A SILVER COIN . " GENEROUS BUT HUMILIATING, " HE RECALLED . HE

BECAME A SOCIALIST AND BEFRIENDED A FELLOW ROMAGNAN NAMED BENITO

MUSSOLINI . IL DUCE'S FASCIST THUGS LATER ALMOST SHOT NENNI WHEN THEY

RAIDED AND BURNED HIS SOCIALIST HEADQUARTERS IN MILAN . NENNI FLED TO

FRANCE, AND DURING THE NEXT 17 YEARS FOUGHT ON THE LOYALIST SIDE IN

SPAIN, WAS CAPTURED BY THE NAZIS IN OCCUPIED FRANCE DURING WORLD WAR

II, TURNED OVER TO ITALIAN POLICE, AND DEPORTED TO THE LONELY ISLAND OF

PONZA IN THE TYRRHENIAN SEA IN 1943 . THREE DAYS AFTER NENNI ARRIVED,

THE SHORTLIVED GOVERNMENT OF MARSHAL BADOGLIO SHIPPED ANOTHER EXILE TO

PONZA : MUSSOLINI . NENNI MADE HIS WAY TO ROME, BECAME FOREIGN

MINISTER AND VICE PREMIER IN A COALITION CABINET THAT INCLUDED

COMMUNISTS . WITH A BERET PUSHED TO THE BACK OF HIS HEAD AND HIS BULL

VOICE ROARING, NENNI DEMANDED " UNITY OF THE WORKING CLASS, "

SOUTH VIET NAM END OF THE GLOW ONE CRITICISM BROUGHT AGAINST

PRESIDENT NGO DINH DIEM WAS THAT HE KEPT SOME OF HIS BEST OFFICERS IN

NONCOMBAT JOBS FOR POLITICAL REASONS . ONE PROMISE MADE BY DIEM'S

SUCCESSORS WAS TO APPOINT AGGRESSIVE NEW COMMANDERS AND GIVE THEM A

FREE HAND . LAST WEEK THE FIRST SUCH NEW COMMANDER FOUND HIMSELF SACKED

AND ORDERED TO A DESK EXILE THAT EVEN DIEM HAD NOT THOUGHT OF MILITARY

ATTACHE IN FORMOSA . FIVE DAYS AFTER THE COUP, COLONEL PHAM VAN DONG,

44, WAS PLACED IN COMMAND OF THE 7TH DIVISION, RESPONSIBLE FOR TWO

PROVINCES SOUTH OF SAIGON . IN HIS FIRST TWELVE DAYS ON THE JOB, DONG

LAUNCHED SEVEN MAJOR OPERATIONS, BUT THEN THE VIET CONG REGAINED THE

INITIATIVE . WHEN ONE VILLAGE NEAR THE CAPITAL WAS SEVERELY SHELLED AND

SEVERAL PEOPLE WERE KILLED, THE VILLAGERS COMPLAINED BITTERLY . EVEN

THOUGH SUCH ATTACKS ARE STANDARD, THE GENERALS IN SAIGON FIRED DONG, TO

THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF U.S . ADVISERS . BUT WHY TRANSFER HIM 1,400 MILES

AWAY ? ACCORDING TO ONE VERSION, DONG HAD BEEN TOO FRIENDLY WITH THE

RULING JUNTA'S AMBITIOUS NO . 3 MAN, MAJOR GENERAL TON THAT DINH, WHOM

SOME OF HIS COLLEAGUES CONSIDER POTENTIALLY TROUBLESOME . ROOM AT THE

TOP . AS THE REVOLUTIONARY GLOW THAT FOLLOWED DIEM'S OVERTHROW FADES,

SOUTH VIET NAM'S GENERALS SEEM TO BE WATCHING EACH OTHER EVER MORE

ALERTLY . THEY NOW OFTEN WRANGLE OVER POLICY IN MARATHON DEBATES THAT

LAST UNTIL 5 A.M . BUREAUCRACY ALSO TAKES ITS TOLL OF LEADERSHIP .

BRIGADIER GENERAL LE VAN KIM, A TOP STRATEGIST, IS OCCUPIED BY

ADMINISTRATIVE CHORES ; LAST WEEK ONE OF HIS STAFF'S CHIEF PROJECTS

WAS REQUISITIONING THREE TYPEWRITERS . NEAR BY, GENERAL DINH FLOPPED

BACK IN HIS CHAIR, GROUSED THAT THE PILE OF PAPER ON HIS DESK GROWS

HIGHER EACH DAY . U.S . OFFICIALS MAINTAIN THAT THE GENERALS ARE

QUIETLY ACCOMPLISHING MUCH BENEATH THE SURFACE ; CONSIDERED AN

IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENT IS THE JUNTA'S START AT WINNING OVER THE HOA HAO

AND CAO DAI SECTS, MANY OF WHOSE MEMBERS HAD COLLABORATED WITH THE VIET

CONG . BUT THE JUNTA CHAIRMAN, LIEUT . GENERAL DUONG VAN ( " BIG " )

MINH, SEEMS RELUCTANT TO WIELD POWER, AND THE OUTSIZED, 22-MEMBER

MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL HAS TAKEN FEW OUTWARDLY BOLD STEPS .

REPORTED TIME CORRESPONDENT MURRAY GART : " NONE OF THIS PROVES THAT

THE GENERALS CANNOT DO THE JOB OF RUNNING SOUTH VIET NAM . IT IS TOO

SOON TO TELL . BUT FOR THE MOMENT, THERE IS A POWER VACUUM AT THE TOP

IN A COUNTRY AT WAR . " IN SAIGON, THERE WERE NEW SUICIDES BY FIRE, THE

FIRST SINCE THE COUP AND VIRTUALLY IGNORED IN COMPARISON TO THE

RELENTLESSLY PUBLICIZED BUDDHIST SUICIDES UNDER DIEM . A 17-YEAR-OLD

GIRL, BACH TRI NGA, DRENCHED HERSELF WITH GASOLINE AND TOUCHED A MATCH

TO HER SKIRTS BEFORE THE LOCAL RESIDENCES OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONTROL

COMMISSION, SET UP IN 1954 TO OVERSEE VIET NAM'S PARTITION . A

22YEAR-OLD UNEMPLOYED PEDICAB DRIVER CREMATED HIMSELF HALF A BLOCK FROM

THE U.S . AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, AND A YOUNG TELEPHONE OPERATOR

FOLLOWED SUIT (HE LEFT A NOTE SAYING HE HAD BEEN REJECTED BY HIS

FATHER) . THE CHARRED SKELETON OF A THIRD VICTIM, AN OLDER MAN, WAS

FOUND NEAR A SUBURBAN GRAVEYARD . AUTHORITIES INSISTED THAT THE MEN

ACTED OUT OF PERSONAL DESPONDENCY BUT CONCEDED THAT THE GIRL MAY HAVE

HAD PRO-COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA IN MIND A FAREWELL NOTE REPEATED THE

NEUTRALIST LINE AGAINST " VIETNAMESE FIGHTING VIETNAMESE . " ALL THE

WAY HOME . THE FIGHTING ITSELF CONTINUED INTENSELY AND INCONCLUSIVELY .

150 ROUNDS OF MORTAR AND RECOILLESS RIFLE FIRE INTO THE LONELY OUTPOST

OF BAUCO, THEN OVERRAN TWO OF ITS THREE BLOCKHOUSES . OF THE 60

DEFENDERS, 18 DIED, 21 WERE WOUNDED AND 21 CAPTURED . ALSO FOUND

SPRAWLED DEAD WITHIN THE POST : 16 WOMEN AND CHILDREN . THE GOVERNMENT

CHASED THE ATTACKERS IN AN OPERATION INVOLVING 3,000 MEN, BUT THE

GUERRILLAS VANISHED . FIVE MORE AMERICANS APPARENTLY LOST THEIR LIVES A

SERGEANT SHOT IN AN AMBUSH AND FOUR AIRMEN ABOARD AN RB-26 THAT CRASHED

INTO THE MEKONG RIVER . THE U.S., NEVERTHELESS, WENT AHEAD WITH PLANS

TO BRING HOME 1,000 TROOPS FROM VIET NAM BY NEW YEAR'S CHIEFLY

WITH EDWARD TOPSELL, AN EARLY 17TH CENTURY BESTIARIST, THAT THE

ELEPHANT IS A " GREAT AND AMPLE DEMONSTRATION OF THE POWER AND WISDOM

OF ALMIGHTY GOD " PARTICULARLY THE WHITE VARIETY . KING BHUMIBOL HAS

DEMOCRATICALLY QUARTERED HIS OWN NINE-YEAR-OLD WHITE MODEL IN THE

BANGKOK ZOO . THERE, WHEN HE REACHES MATURITY IN A FEW YEARS, THE

HANDSOME SPECIMEN MAY BECOME THE FIRST WHITE ELEPHANT EVER TO BE MATED

IN CAPTIVITY . THEY INSIST TO

THIS DAY THAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN SHOULD HAVE ACCEPTED THEIR KING MONGKUT'S

THE KING THAT THE U.S . CLIMATE DID NOT " FAVOR THE MULTIPLICATION OF

DID SIKKIM . BUT TO THE LATE MAHARAJAH, FREEDOM BROUGHT MORE PROBLEMS

THAN PROFIT . ONE DAY IN 1949, SEVERAL THOUSAND PEASANTS SWARMED AROUND

THE BLUE AND WHITE ROYAL PALACE (ACTUALLY A LARGE BUNGALOW) DEMANDING

AN ELECTED NATIONAL COUNCIL AND TAX REFORMS . TASHI SUBMITTED TO THE

EXPERIMENT IN DEMOCRACY FOR 29 DAYS AND THEN, FEELING UNABLE TO COPE

RESULT, CATTLE, COFFEE AND BANANAS AND U.S . FOOD FOR PEACE SUPPLIES

TOURE ALSO NATIONALIZED VIRTUALLY EVERY BUSINESS IN GUINEA, INCLUDING

THE ONCE-LUCRATIVE DIAMOND MINES . SOON EVERY COMMODITY FROM TAP WATER

TO BEER-BOTTLE CAPS WAS IN SHORT SUPPLY . ONCE-DOCILE GUINEANS REACTED

QUESTIONS OF 1) HOW MUCH OF A VOICE EUROPE IS TO HAVE AS TO WHEN AND

HOW THIS U.S . FORCE IS TO BE APPLIED, AND 2) WHAT WESTERN STRATEGY

SHOULD BE IN THE INTERMEDIATE GREY AREA SHORT OF TOTAL WAR, AN AREA IN

WHICH NATO IS PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANT POLITICALLY THAN MILITARILY .

THESE PROBLEMS SWIRLED UP AGAIN THIS WEEK AS THE FOREIGN AND DEFENSE

MINISTERS OF 15 NATO NATIONS SAT DOWN FOR THEIR BIG ANNUAL REVIEW

WAS CROWDED WITH DISTANT GENERAL MATTERS : WHAT NEXT IN DISARMAMENT

SURFACE SHIPS ARMED WITH POLARIS WEAPONS AND MANNED BY MIXED CREWS FROM

ARDENT OF ALL THOSE I MET IN MY CAREER AS A SPY . . . DESPITE THE

BOTTLED-IN-BOND FLAVOR, THE SCENE ACTUALLY TOOK PLACE IN WARTIME

WASHINGTON . IT WAS RECOUNTED RECENTLY IN LONDON'S THE PEOPLE BY ITS

HEROINE, A MATA HARI FROM MINNESOTA WHO WORKED FOR BRITISH INTELLIGENCE

UNDER THE CODE NAME CYNTHIA . HER REAL NAME : ELIZABETH PACK . USING

THE BOUDOIR AS IAN FLEMING'S HERO USES A BERETTA, SHE WAS DESCRIBED BY

HER WARTIME BOSS AS " THE GREATEST UNSUNG HEROINE OF THE WAR . " AFTER

THE WAR CYNTHIA MARRIED HER ONETIME PREY, THE ARDENT CHARLES, AND WITH

HIM RETREATED TO A REMOTE 10TH CENTURY FRENCH CHATEAU WHERE SHE DIED

LAST WEEK, AT 53, OF THROAT CANCER . SCUPPERED ADMIRAL . WHEN WORLD WAR

II BROKE OUT, BLONDE, GREEN-EYED CYNTHIA HAD BEEN MARRIED FOR NINE

YEARS TO ARTHUR PACK, A COLORLESS BRITISH DIPLOMAT WHO WAS NEARLY TWICE

HER AGE . THE DAUGHTER OF A U.S . MARINE CORPS COLONEL, AT 29 SHE WAS

ADVENTUROUS, ASTUTE, ATTRACTIVE AND, FROM DILIGENT YEARS ON EUROPE'S

DIPLOMATIC CIRCUIT, ALREADY AN OLD HAND AT AFFAIRS OF STATE . LEAVING

HER HUSBAND, SHE RETURNED TO THE U.S . SHORTLY AFTER THE FALL OF

FRANCE, IMMEDIATELY JOINED BRITISH SECURITY COORDINATION (B.S.C.), THE

MANHATTANBASED INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERESPIONAGE NETWORK THAT WAS RUN

BY SIR WILLIAM STEPHENSON, THE FAMED " QUIET CANADIAN . " HE SENT

CYNTHIA TO WASHINGTON, WHERE SHE TOOK A GEORGETOWN HOUSE ON O STREET

AND WENT TO WORK . CYNTHIA'S FIRST BIG ASSIGNMENT WAS ENOUGH TO DAUNT

THE WILIEST OLD PRO : HER ORDERS WERE TO GET HOLD OF THE ITALIAN NAVAL

CODE BOOK . WITHIN A FEW WEEKS OF FIRST MEETING THE SHAPELY BETTY PACK,

ITALY'S NAVAL ATTACHE, ADMIRAL ALBERTO LAIS, WAS SO SCUPPERED BY HER

THAT HE SURRENDERED THE CODE WITH HARDLY A MURMUR . ITALIAN APOLOGISTS

MAINTAIN THAT LAIS, WHO DIED IN 1951, WAS ACTUALLY SO UNGALLANT AS TO

GIVE HIS MISTRESS A FAKE CIPHER BOOK . UNDENIABLY, HOWEVER, BRITISH

INTELLIGENCE THEREAFTER PROVED UNCANNILY ADEPT AT FORESTALLING ITALIAN

FLEET MOVEMENTS, NOTABLY IN THE MARCH 1941 SEA BATTLE OFF GREECE'S CAPE

MATAPAN, WHERE THE ROYAL NAVY CRIPPLED ITALY'S NUMERICALLY SUPERIOR

FORCE . OUTWITTED WATCHMAN . FOR THE U.S . AS WELL AS BRITAIN,

CYNTHIA'S MOST VALUABLE COUP WAS TO CAPTURE THE SECRET CODE USED BY THE

VICHY GOVERNMENT'S DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS AS WELL AS THE FRENCH FLEET,

WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE TAKEN THOUSANDS OF ALLIED LIVES DURING THE

INVASION OF NORTH AFRICA . POSING AS A WASHINGTON NEWSHEN, CYNTHIA HAD

ALREADY SEDUCED THE DASHING CAPTAIN BROUSSE, THEN THE PRESS ATTACHE IN

THE PETAIN GOVERNMENT'S WASHINGTON EMBASSY ; BY PLAYING ON HIS HATRED

OF THE NAZIS, SHE MADE HIM A WILLING ALLY . " I WAS NOT JUST INDULGING

HIS DESIRES SO AS TO GET HIM TO DISCLOSE MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC

INTELLIGENCE, " WROTE CYNTHIA . " I WAS FULFILLING A DEEP NEED OF MY

OWN . " BROUSSE MORE THAN SATISFIED HER BOSSES' NEEDS AS WELL BY

SUPPLYING DAILY COPIES OF ALL FRENCH DIPLOMATIC CABLES . IN 1942, WHEN

THE EMBASSY'S NAVAL ATTACHE PROVED SEDUCIBLE BUT OBDURATELY PRO-VICHY,

BROUSSE EVEN AGREED TO HELP HER FILCH THE CODE BOOKS FROM THE ATTACHE'S

OFFICE SO THAT THEY COULD BE COPIED AND RETURNED TO THE EMBASSY SAFE

UNNOTICED . THEIR TACTICS WERE EXQUISITELY GALLIC . CHARLES SHOWED UP

AT THE EMBASSY WITH CYNTHIA ONE NIGHT AND, RUSTLING A FEW DOLLAR BILLS,

WHISPERED TO THE UNDERSTANDING WATCHMAN THAT MME . BROUSSE WAS

SUSPICIOUS OF THEIR LIAISON (SHE WAS, INDEED, AND LATER DIVORCED HIM) .

THE EMBASSY, BROUSSE EXPLAINED TO THE GUARD, WAS THE ONLY PLACE WHERE

HE AND HIS GIRL COULD RENDEZVOUS, AND THEY SOON BECAME REGULAR VISITORS

. ON THE NIGHT THEY PLANNED TO LIFT THE CODE, WITH THE HELP OF A

SAFEBREAKER CALLED THE GEORGIA CRACKER, THEY PUT THE WATCHMAN TO SLEEP

WITH DRUGGED CHAMPAGNE, ONLY TO FIND THAT THE LOCKS WERE SO TOUGH THAT

THEY HAD TO COMPLETE THE JOB A FEW NIGHTS LATER . BY NOW, THEY GUESSED

THAT THE NIGHT WATCHMAN MUST SUSPECT THAT IT WAS NOT JUST AMOUR THEY

WERE AFTER . SURE ENOUGH, SOON AFTER CYNTHIA AND HER LOVER ENTERED THE

DARKENED OFFICE, THE DOOR BURST OPEN AND THE WATCHMAN STUDIED THEM

UNDER A POWERFUL FLASHLIGHT . FINALLY, HE BLURTED, " I BEG YOUR PARDON,

MADAME, A THOUSAND TIMES, " AND FLED DOWN THE CORRIDOR . BEFORE GOING

TO WORK ON THE SAFE, CYNTHIA HAD TAKEN THE SIMPLE PRECAUTION OF

REMOVING ALL HER CLOTHES .

RUSSIA BETTER THINGS FOR BETTER LIVING THROUGH CHEMISTRY ? /

UTOPIANS THINK THAT SCIENCE CAN TRANSFORM THE ATLANTIC OCEAN INTO

LEMONADE, " SNORTED KARL MARX'S CO-WORKER, FRIEDRICH ENGELS . YET WHO

SHOULD BE SERVING UP LEMONADE LAST WEEK THAN THAT OLD REALIST NIKITA

KHRUSHCHEV . IN THE KREMLIN'S MARBLE-HALLED PALACE OF THE CONGRESSES,

ADDRESSING THE COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE AND MORE THAN 5,000

OTHER COMRADES, NIKITA PROMISED THAT ONE GREAT FORCE WOULD MIRACULOUSLY

STRAIGHTEN OUT THE SOVIET ECONOMIC MESS : BIG CHEMISTRY . BETWEEN 1964

AND 1970, KHRUSHCHEV ANNOUNCED, THE REGIME WILL SPEND $46 BILLION TO

EXPAND THE SOVIET CHEMICAL INDUSTRY ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT THAT NOW GOES

ANNUALLY INTO ALL DOMESTIC ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT . WHERE WOULD THE

ADDITIONAL MONEY COME FROM ? KHRUSHCHEV HINTED AT A RADICAL REDUCTION

IN MILITARY SPENDING . MORE IMPORTANT, HE ADMITTED THAT RUSSIA WOULD

NEED CREDIT AND SUPPLIES, INCLUDING ENTIRE FACTORIES, FROM THE WEST BUT

NOT, HE FUMED, AT " FABULOUS PROFITS " TO THE CAPITALISTS . BRAVE TALK

. PLANS CALL FOR BUILDING 200 NEW PLANTS AND MODERNIZING 500 OLD ONES

; SINCE MUCH OF THE NEW PRODUCTION WILL BE PLASTICS AND SYNTHETIC

FIBERS, SOVIET CITIZENS MAY AT LAST FIND IT EASIER TO BUY SUCH SIMPLE

ITEMS AS NYLON STOCKINGS AND LINOLEUM FLOORING . " FOR THE FIRST TIME

IN ALL THE 46 YEARS OF SOVIET POWER, " SAID NIKITA IN A REMARKABLE

CONFESSION, THE PARTY AND THE STATE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT " SATISFYING

THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PEOPLE . " MOREOVER, NEW PRODUCTS MUST SHOW

BETTER DESIGN, BECAUSE IT IS " NO LONGER POSSIBLE TO TOLERATE " RUSSIAN

CONSUMER GOODS THAT " LOOK LESS SMART THAN FOREIGN ARTICLES . " AN EVEN

MORE URGENT TASK FOR BIG CHEMISTRY IS THE PRODUCTION OF CHEMICAL

FERTILIZER . ITS OUTPUT, PROMISED KHRUSHCHEV, WOULD BE QUADRUPLED FROM

20 MILLION TONS THIS YEAR TO 80 MILLION TONS BY 1970 . THIS WOULD

PERMIT RUSSIA TO CATCH UP WITH THE U.S., FOR U.S . FARM SURPLUSES ARE

NOT THE RESULT OF ANY " SPECIAL AMERICAN WISDOM, " KHRUSHCHEV INSISTED

; IT IS JUST THAT THE U.S . USES ALMOST TWICE AS MUCH FERTILIZER AS

THE SOVIET UNION ON ABOUT HALF THE ACREAGE . THROUGH ALL THIS BRAVE

TALK RAN THE ADMISSION OF RUSSIA'S DISASTROUS AGRICULTURAL FAILURES .

ONE ARRESTING FIGURE : ALTHOUGH ACREAGE INCREASED 7 PER CENT SINCE

LAST YEAR, YIELD ACTUALLY DROPPED 20 PER CENT . IF ANYONE WAS INCLINED

TO CRITICIZE THIS FAILURE, OR THE COSTLY PALLIATIVE OF BUYING GRAIN

FROM THE WEST, KHRUSHCHEV HAD THE STANDARD ANSWER . REMEMBER HOW

BAD THINGS

WERE UNDER STALIN . IN 1947, TO EARN FOREIGN EXCHANGE, STALIN AND

MOLOTOV ACTUALLY SOLD GRAIN ABROAD WHILE IN A NUMBER OF AREAS " PEOPLE

HAD BLOATED STOMACHS OR EVEN DIED FROM LACK OF FOOD . " IT WAS THE

FIRST TIME MOSCOW HAD ADMITTED THAT STARVATION TOOK PLACE IN THE SOVIET

UNION SINCE THE FORCED COLLECTIVIZATION OF THE EARLY 1930S . BULGING

WAREHOUSES . FOLLOWING KHRUSHCHEV'S 4F-HOUR SPEECH, OTHER COMMUNIST

BIGWIGS SHOOK THE AUDIENCE WITH A SERIES OF ANGRY COMPLAINTS . MOST

COLLECTIVE FARMERS DO NOT KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT USING CHEMICAL

FERTILIZER ; THE UKRAINE IS PLANNING A CRASH PROGRAM TO EDUCATE 4,000

/ SKILLED FERTILIZER APPLIERS . " SUPERPHOSPHATE FERTILIZER ARRIVES AT

THE FARMS WITH ONLY 20 PER CENT OF THE REQUIRED CHEMICAL NUTRIENTS ;

THE REST IS WORTHLESS BALLAST THAT GETS LUMPY AND HEAVY IN THE RAIN .

RUSSIA HAS AN IMPRESSIVE 561 SOIL LABORATORIES, BUT MOST OF THEM HAVE

ONLY ONE OR TWO EMPLOYEES AND THE WRONG EQUIPMENT . AS FOR THE CHEMICAL

INDUSTRY ITSELF, MANAGERS ARE STILL WAITING FOR DELIVERY OF EQUIPMENT

DESIGNED TEN YEARS AGO . SOME OF THE PRODUCTS ARE SO UNGAINLY THAT THEY

PILE UP UNSOLD IN WAREHOUSES FOR INSTANCE, SYNTHETIC FUR COATS, WHICH,

COMPLAINED ONE SPEAKER, " ARE SO HEAVY THAT ONLY WELL-TRAINED ATHLETES

CAN WEAR THEM . " ONLY ABOUT 30 PER CENT OF THE WORKERS IN THE INDUSTRY

ARE ENGAGED IN PRODUCTION, WHILE THE REST ARE OCCUPIED WITH MAINTENANCE

OR BUREAUCRATIC TASKS . MOREOVER, WORKERS ARE UNDERPAID AND RECEIVE

ONLY A FRACTION OF THE PRESCRIBED INCENTIVE BONUSES . THE MATTER OF

PERSONAL INCENTIVES WAS CLEARLY THE KEY TO THE SITUATION, BOTH IN

INDUSTRY AND AGRICULTURE . IT IS THE VERY NATURE OF COLLECTIVE FARMING

NOT THE RELATIVELY SUPERFICIAL PROBLEM OF FERTILIZER PRODUCTION THAT

ACCOUNTS FOR THE CHRONIC CRISIS . AS KHRUSHCHEV'S OWN FIGURES SHOWED,

PEASANTS WORKING ON THEIR TINY, PRIVATE HALF-ACRE PLOTS, WHICH COMPRISE

LESS THAN 1 PER CENT OF THE ARABLE LAND, SELL TO THE STATE 14 PER CENT

OF THE COUNTRY'S MEAT, 30 PER CENT OF THE EGGS, AND RAISE 65 PER CENT

OF THE CABBAGES AND POTATOES .

THAILAND DEATH OF A MAN ON A VISIT TO THAILAND TWO YEARS AGO,

LYNDON JOHNSON SAID THAT THE TIME HAD COME FOR SOUTH EAST ASIA TO /

SEPARATE THE MEN FROM THE BOYS " IN ITS BATTLE AGAINST COMMUNIST

AGGRESSION . IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD, THAILAND'S PREMIER SARIT

THANARAT WAS A MAN . A BLUFF, HARD-WENCHING, HARD-DRINKING SOLDIER,

SARIT WAS ALSO A MASTERLY PRO-WESTERN POLITICIAN WHO STABILIZED

THAILAND'S CHAOTIC GOVERNMENT AND SAGGING ECONOMY, ROOTED OUT OFFICIAL

CORRUPTION AND CRACKED DOWN HARD ON COMMUNIST INFILTRATION . IN THE "

DOMINO " VIEW OF SOUTHEAST ASIA, ACCORDING TO WHICH THE COLLAPSE OF ONE

COUNTRY COULD KNOCK OVER ALL THE OTHERS, THAILAND ALONE STOOD FIRM,

SURROUNDED BY TOTTERING NEIGHBORS LAOS, CAMBODIA, VIET NAM, BURMA .

WHEN SARIT DIED LAST WEEK AT 55, THE U.S . FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FIVE

YEARS WAS FORCED TO WORRY WHETHER THAILAND WOULD BECOME ANOTHER OF

SOUTHEAST ASIA'S WAVERING DOMINOES . TRICK ACHIEVED . THOUGH MARSHAL

SARIT RULED THAILAND AS AN ABSOLUTE DICTATOR, HE HAD A STRONG SENSE OF

RESPONSIBILITY TOWARD COUNTRY AND PEOPLE . " ANYBODY CAN STAGE A

REVOLUTION, " HE SAID AFTER SEIZING POWER IN A BLOODLESS COUP IN 1957 .

/ THE TRICK, ONCE THE REVOLUTION HAS BEEN STAGED, IS WINNING PUBLIC

APPROVAL . " ON DOCTOR'S ORDERS, HE WENT ON THE WAGON, BEGAN

HOUSECLEANING THAILAND FROM TOP TO BOTTOM . HE BANNED OPIUM SMOKING,

AND WHEN A RASH OF FIRES BROKE OUT IN BANGKOK'S BUSINESS DISTRICT ONE

WINTER, HE ORDERED FOUR CHINESE MERCHANTS SHOT A BRUTAL BUT EFFECTIVE

REMINDER THAT THE ANNUAL CUSTOM OF BURNING SHOPS TO COLLECT INSURANCE

FOR THE CHINESE NEW YEAR WAS NOW TABOO . SARIT SLASHED THE PRICE OF

RICE, TRANSPORTATION AND SCHOOL FEES, ALLOCATED AS MUCH MONEY FOR

EDUCATION AS FOR DEFENSE . HE ENCOURAGED FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND

INDUSTRIAL EXPANSION, HAD MORE THAN $500 MILLION IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RESERVES SOCKED AWAY, SPURRED A HEALTHY 6 PER CENT ANNUAL RISE IN THE

G.N.P . WHEN COMMUNIST GUERRILLAS STEPPED UP THEIR CAMPAIGN OF

SUBVERSION IN THE SCRUBBY, IMPOVERISHED NORTHEAST PROVINCES, SARIT SET

IN MOTION A CRASH $300 MILLION PROGRAM OF MEDICAL, ECONOMIC AND

EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT THAT UNDERCUT THE RED THREAT . THOUGH HIS RULE

WAS ABSOLUTE, HE ALWAYS KNELT BEFORE THAILAND'S KING BHUMIBOL

ADULYADEJ, ENCOURAGED THAIS TO ACCEPT THE KING AS HEAD OF STATE AND

SYMBOL OF NATIONAL UNITY . THREE WEEKS AGO, SARIT WENT TO THE HOSPITAL

WITH COMPLICATIONS ARISING FROM CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER AND A LIFETIME

OF HARD LIVING . AMONG HIS OTHER AILMENTS : ENLARGEMENT OF THE HEART,

HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, KIDNEY DISEASE, CONGESTED LUNGS . FROM HIS

HOSPITAL BED, HE SANG TO HIS WIFE AN OLD THAI BALLAD THAT BEGINS : /

THE LOVE OF 100 MISTRESSES COULD NOT BE COMPARED TO THE LOVE ONE HAS

FOR HIS OWN WIFE.' ? THE U.S . ARMY SURGEON GENERAL RUSHED TO BANGKOK

TO TREAT SARIT, BUT HIS HEART FINALLY GAVE OUT . THE JOB AHEAD .

SARIT'S DEATH OCCASIONED NATIONAL MOURNING AND HONORS USUALLY ACCORDED

ONLY TO THAILAND'S ROYAL FAMILY . DRESSED IN A FIELD MARSHAL'S UNIFORM,

SARIT'S BODY WAS PLACED ON A BIER IN BANGKOK ON THE GROUNDS OF THE

MARBLE TEMPLE . THOUSANDS OF MOURNERS POURED SCENTED WATER FROM CONCH

SHELLS OVER THE CORPSE'S EXTENDED RIGHT HAND AS A GESTURE OF FAREWELL

AND AS A PLEA FOR FORGIVENESS FOR ANY GRIEVANCE COMMITTED AGAINST THE

DEAD MAN . THEN THE BODY, FOLDED IN A FETAL POSITION, WAS PUT IN AN

ORNATE GOLDEN URN, WHERE IT WILL REMAIN UNTIL IT IS CREMATED, PROBABLY

SOME TIME IN THE EARLY SPRING . SARIT'S SUCCESSOR IS FORMER VICE

PREMIER AND DEFENSE MINISTER THANOM KITTIKACHORN, 52, A HANDSOME,

AMIABLE ARMY GENERAL WHO SERVED UNIMPRESSIVELY AS PREMIER IN 1958 WHEN

SARIT WAS LAID UP IN A WASHINGTON HOSPITAL . THANOM WAS A CLOSE FRIEND

OF SARIT'S AND A LOYAL SUPPORTER OF HIS POLICIES ; HE IMMEDIATELY

APPOINTED A NEW CABINET ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS HIS PREDECESSOR'S,

PROMISED TO FOLLOW SARIT'S PRO-WESTERN, ANTI-COMMUNIST POLICIES . MOST

IN HIS FAVOR : HE INHERITS A FUNCTIONING GOVERNMENT IN WHICH THE ARMY

PROVIDES POWER, THE TOPFLIGHT CIVIL SERVICE CONTRIBUTES ADMINISTRATIVE

ABILITY, AND THE MONARCHY LENDS LEGITIMACY TO THE WHOLE . BUT

REMEMBERING THAILAND'S SHAKY, PRE-SARIT PAST, IN WHICH COUP FOLLOWED

COUP, THAILAND'S MOST SOPHISTICATED LEADERS KNOW THAT THIS SYSTEM WILL

HAVE TO WITHSTAND A STRONG DRIFT BACK TO THE OLD PATTERN . THE THAI

NATION FACES " A TREMENDOUS TASK, " SAYS ABLE FOREIGN MINISTER THANAT

KHOMAN . " IT IS, AS YOU SAY IN AMERICA, A HELL OF A JOB . /

VIET NAM'S NEW REGIME, WHICH WAS HELPED TO POWER BY THE U.S . ON THE

THEORY THAT IT WOULD FIGHT THE WAR MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN THE MURDERED

PRESIDENT DIEM, BUT WHICH, SO FAR AT LEAST, HAS PROVIDED DISAPPOINTING

LEEDERSHIP . THE WAR IS STILL SHOWING ALARMING DRIFT, AND THE COMMUNIST

GUERRILLAS HAVE SHOWN SIGNS OF GETTING BOLDER . LAST WEEK TIME

CORRESPONDENT MURRAY GART, TO GET HIS OWN LOOK AT THE WAR, FLEW ON 26

HELICOPTER MISSIONS IN FIVE DAYS (THREE OF HIS CHOPPERS WERE HIT BY

GUNFIRE), CAME AWAY WITH THE STORY OF A PLAN FOR STEPPED-UP AERIAL

STRIKES AGAINST THE REDS AND SOME GRIM IMPRESSIONS OF THE FIGHTING IN

GENERAL . GART'S REPORT : AT SAIGON

AIRPORT BEFORE DAWN, A SWARM OF HELICOPTERS SPUTTERED TO LIFE, THEIR

WHIRLING BLADES CHURNING UP MISTY CONTRAILS IN THE COOL, DAMP AIR .

SOON A FORMATION OF 13 " HUEYS " (UH-1BS) WAS AIRBORNE AND DRONING AWAY

AT 2,000 FT . BELOW, THE LIGHT OF DAY BROKE OVER THE MEKONG DELTA,

TURNING RIVERS AND CANALS INTO SILVERY RIBBONS AMONG THE GREEN

PADDYFIELDS . INSIDE THE CHOPPERS, MEN LONG HARDENED TO POSSIBLE DEATH

CAREFULLY CRUSHED OUT THEIR AFTER-BREAKFAST CIGARETTES . A MERE FIFTEEN

MINUTES OUT OF SAIGON AND DIRECTLY SOUTH OF THE CAPITAL, THE THREE LEAD

HUEYS, BRISTLING WITH ROCKETS AND MACHINE GUNS, BUZZED THE TARGET AREA

; THEY HEDGE-HOPPED LINES OF FOLIAGE, HOVERED OVER HUTS, SCRUTINIZED

THE PADDY FIELDS . " NEGATIVE CONTACT, " U.S . PILOT CAPTAIN DENNIS

BOYLE RADIOED TO THE MAIN FORCE, MEANING NO GROUND FIRE . THE REST OF

THE FLEET FLUTTERED INTO THE ZONE, AND WHILE ARMED CRAFT CIRCLED

PROTECTIVELY, FIVE " SKINNED " (UNARMED) HUEYS ALIGHTED IN A CLEARING

AND DISGORGED 70 VIETNAMESE TROOPS . THE SOLDIERS SWEPT THROUGH A

VILLAGE, ROUNDING UP PEASANTS SUSPECTED OF BEING GUERRILLAS ; SOME OF

THE MEN HAD BEEN FOUND CROUCHING TOGETHER, UNABLE TO EXPLAIN WHY THEY

WERE NOT OUT IN THE FIELDS WORKING . ONE OFFERED A SOLDIER 1,000

PIASTERS ($13.60) TO SET HIM FREE ; THE SOLDIER GLADLY ACCEPTED THE

PAYOFF, THEN TAGGED THE CAPTIVE WITH A WHITE SCARF IDENTIFYING HIM AS A

PROBABLE VIET CONG . SHIRTS WERE STRIPPED FROM BACKS TO CHECK FOR THE

GUERRILLA'S TELLTALE MARKS OF PACK STRAPS . FORTY-FIVE MINUTES LATER,

THE HELICOPTERS WERE HEADED BACK TO SAIGON WITH A HAUL OF 14 PRISONERS

. REPLACING TERROR . THE OPERATION, CALLED AN " EAGLE STRIKE,

/ IS A TACTIC BY WHICH THE NEW GOVERNMENT AND ITS U.S . ADVISERS HOPE

TO ADD SPEED AND INITIATIVE TO ANTI-GUERRILLA OPERATIONS . THOUGH SUCH

STRIKES HAVE LONG BEEN USED IN VIET NAM FOR MISSIONS BIG AND SMALL, THE

PROGRAM NOW BEING LAUNCHED AIMS TO CARRY OUT SMALLSCALE,

SEARCH-AND-SEIZE MISSIONS AS NEVER BEFORE, ESPECIALLY IN THE HEAVILY

INFILTRATED DELTA . FOR THE FIRST TIME THE U.S . UTILITY TACTICAL

TRANSPORT COMPANY BASED AT SAIGON AIRPORT HAS BEEN ASSIGNED " EAGLE

STRIKES " AS A PERMANENT DUTY . A U.S . MAJOR DESCRIBES THE OPERATION

AS " A RECONNAISSANCE FORCE ALWAYS SEEKING OUT THE ENEMY, STRIKING ONLY

WHEN CONTACT IS MADE OR INTELLIGENCE IS GOOD ENOUGH TO MAKE A LANDING

WORTHWHILE . ALSO, IT IS CARRIED OUT BY A SMALL FORCE, NOT ONE THAT

REQUIRES THE MOVEMENT OF DOZENS OF CRAFT AND BATTALIONS OF MEN . "

BRIGADIER GENERAL JOSEPH W . STILWELL JR., " VINEGAR JOE'S " SON, WHO "

FLIES " A DESK IN SAIGON BUT WHO IS ALWAYS SLIPPING OUT ON CHOPPER

MISSIONS, PUTS THE TACTICAL CHALLENGE IN SOUTH VIET NAM IN BRUTALLY

FRANK TERMS . " THE PROBLEM, " SAYS HE, " IS TO REPLACE VIET CONG

CONTROL OF THE COUNTRYSIDE, WHICH THEY MAINTAIN THROUGH MURDER, RAPE,

TORTURE AND TERROR, WITH SOMETHING ELSE . WE DON'T USE TERROR TACTICS .

THE EAGLE STRIKE IS THE BEST WAY TO GO AFTER THEM, USING THE ELEMENT OF

COMPLETE SURPRISE . BUT IT IS ONLY ONE WAY, AND WE NEED OTHERS . "

AFTER COMPLETING THEIR CRACK-OF-DAWN MISSION LAST WEEK THE CREWS OF THE

13 HUEYS AND THE 70 VIETNAMESE SOLDIERS RESTED WHILE THEIR CHOPPERS

WERE BEING REFUELED, THEN WERE AIRBORNE AGAIN, HEADING FOR A

VILLAGE JUST TWELVE MILES SOUTH OF SAIGON . THIS TIME ONE HELICOPTER IN

THE FIRST WAVE TOOK A BULLET IN THE FUSELAGE, BUT THE TROOP CARRIERS

SET DOWN ANYWAY . THE SOLDIERS FOUND THE VILLAGE FLYING A VIET CONG

HAD NOT MANAGED TO ESCAPE . PRIVATE YALU . THE HELICOPTER

WORK REQUIRES STEADY NERVES . ONE ARMED HUEY ESCORTING A SUPPLY CHOPPER

MACHINEGUN NEST THAT HAD OPENED FIRE . JUST BEFORE ONE ROCKET WAS

DROPPED, IT WAS APPARENTLY STRUCK BY A SNIPER'S BULLET AND BLEW UP,

SHATTERING THE PLANE'S PLEXIGLAS WINDOWS ; THE GUNNER AND THE CREW

THINGS DO SEEM CERTAIN : MANY MORE LIVES WILL BE TRAGICALLY LOST, THE

WAR CANNOT POSSIBLY BE WON BY 1965, AND A RICH JEWEL OF A COUNTRY

CARVED OUT OF ANCIENT INDOCHINA SEES NO END IN SIGHT TO A DECADE OF

RED-INSTIGATED FIGHTING . ABOUT THE BEST THAT CAN BE EXPECTED IS TO

MAINTAIN HOPE, APPLY MUSCLE IN THE RIGHT PLACES, MAKE LONG-RANGE

COMMITMENTS, AND RETAIN A DOGGED DETERMINATION TO KEEP FIGHTING . THEN

MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, EVENTS AND THE TIDE OF BATTLE WILL MERGE TO KEEP

THIS PIECE OF REAL ESTATE FROM COMMUNIST CONTROL .

KENYA UHURU IS NOT ENOUGH THE YOUTH RALLY AT NAIROBI

LAST WEEK WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF FOUR RANGY

AFRICANS . EACH WAS CLAD IN ANIMAL SKINS, ARMED WITH SHARP-BLADED

PANGAS AND WEARING HIS HAIR IN LONG BRAIDS SMEARED WITH RED MUD THE

FIGHTING INSIGNIA OF THE MAU MAU TERRORISTS . THE CROWD FELL SILENT AS

THE FOUR APPROACHED THE DAIS WHERE SAT PRIME MINISTER JOMO KENYATTA AND

HIS HONORED GUEST, PRINCE PHILIP, HUSBAND OF BRITAIN'S QUEEN ELIZABETH

. WITH HIS LUMBERING, ELEPHANT WALK, KENYATTA DESCENDED FROM THE DAIS,

PUSHED THROUGH HIS STARTLED SECURITY GUARDS, AND GREETED THE MAU MAU .

/ KENYA IS FREE NOW, " HE SAID . " THERE IS NO NEED TO HIDE OR FIGHT .

/ PEACEFULLY, THE FOUR MEN SURRENDERED THEIR WEAPONS . THE CEREMONY .

ALTHOUGH KENYA'S VICIOUS MAU MAU LONG AGO STOPPED FIGHTING, MANY WERE

STILL HIDING OUT IN THE GREEN-BLACK FORESTS ON THE SLOPES OF MOUNT

ASSORTED " GENERALS . " THE FOREIGN REPRESENTATIVES ARRIVING ALONG WITH

THE MAU MAU RANGED FROM RED CHINA'S FOREIGN MINISTER CHEN YI TO INDIA'S

INDIRA GANDHI AND U.S . INTERIOR SECRETARY STEWART UDALL . ALSO FROM

THE U.S., AS GUESTS AND ENTERTAINERS, CAME HARRY BELAFONTE AND MIRIAM

MAKEBA. THERE WERE BALLS, GARDEN PARTIES, RECEPTIONS, THE LAYING OF

CORNERSTONES, AND THE PRESENTATION OF GIFTS . QUEEN ELIZABETH GAVE

KENYATTA THE ROYAL LODGE AT SAGANA ; THE AGA KHAN TURNED OVER TO HIM

HIS OWN FORMER RESIDENCE ; A GROUP OF U.S . BUSINESSMEN DONATED A

WHITE LINCOLN CONTINENTAL . THE CLIMAX CAME WHEN KENYATTA GOT INTO HIS

NEW CAR AND WAS DRIVEN TO UHURU STADIUM . AT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE

MIDNIGHT, AS KENYATTA ROSE TO TAKE PART IN THE FLAG-RAISING CEREMONY,

PRINCE PHILIP WHISPERED JOKINGLY TO HIM, " ARE YOU SURE YOU WOULDN'T

LIKE TO CHANGE YOUR MIND NOW ? " SMILING, KENYATTA SHOOK HIS HEAD

AND, ACCOMPANIED BY BRITAIN'S GOVERNOR MALCOLM MACDONALD (WHO WILL STAY

ON AS GOVERNOR-GENERAL), WALKED TO THE TWO FLAGPOLES IN THE CENTER OF

THE STADIUM . IN ORDER TO SPARE BRITISH ONLOOKERS ALL POSSIBLE ANGUISH,

KENYATTA HAD TACTFULLY ORDERED THAT THE LIGHTS BE DIMMED DURING THE

MOMENT THE UNION JACK WAS LOWERED, AND THEN BLAZED ON AGAIN AS KENYA'S

FLAG WAS RAISED . THE NEW BANNER : BLACK FOR THE PEOPLE, RED FOR THE

BLOOD THAT HAS BEEN SHED, AND GREEN FOR THE LAND, WITH THIN WHITE LINES

INSERTED BETWEEN THE COLORS . THE WHITE, SAYS KENYATTA, IS TO ENSURE

THAT THE FLAG REPRESENTS ALL KENYANS . SLOWLY THE BANNER OF AFRICA'S

35TH NEW STATE UNFURLED TO WILD CRIES OF " UHURU ! " AND THE

EXPLOSION OF FIREWORKS . MINUTES LATER, WORD REACHED THE STADIUM THAT A

TEAM OF CLIMBERS HAD REACHED THE SUMMIT OF MOUNT KENYA, PLANTED THE NEW

FLAG AND LIT FLARES THAT ILLUMINATED THE SACRED MOUNTAIN " LIKE A

FIREBALL . " THE PROBLEMS . DESPITE HIS ESTIMATED 73 YEARS (HE CLAIMS

NOT TO BE SURE OF HIS BIRTH DATE), AND FREQUENT SIGNS OF FATIGUE,

KENYATTA IS STILL TALL AND BROADSHOULDERED, HIS EYES HUGE AND PIERCING

. IN HIS TIME HE HAS BEEN A FARM BOY, STUDENT, LABORER, METER-READER,

RESPECTED ANTHROPOLOGIST, HEADMASTER, CONVICTED TERRORIST AND, FOR

DECADES, THE UNPARALLELED IDOL OF MILLIONS OF AFRICANS . THE COUNTRY HE

NOW RULES CARRIES MOST OF ITS OLD ILLS INTO INDEPENDENCE . ABROAD, THE

MOST IMMEDIATE PROBLEM IS A VIOLENT QUARREL WITH KENYA'S NORTHEASTERN

NEIGHBOR, SOMALIA, WHICH LAYS CLAIM TO THE BARREN BUT EXTENSIVE

NORTHEASTERN REGION, INHABITED BY 200,000 SOMALIS (SEE MAP) . TO

DIMINISH SUCH QUARRELS, KENYA IS EARNESTLY PUSHING AN EAST AFRICAN

FEDERATION OF KENYA WITH TANGANYIKA AND UGANDA, WHICH WOULD CREATE A

NATION OF 25 MILLION PEOPLE AND MIGHT EVENTUALLY BE EXTENDED TO SUCH

SMALL STATES AS ZANZIBAR, NYASALAND, RWANDA AND BURUNDI .

INTERNATIONALLY, KENYA WILL, OF COURSE, BE NEUTRALIST AND ACCEPT AID

FROM BOTH EAST AND WEST .

INDEPENDENCE BROUGHT ABOUT A

REUNION OF KENYATTA'S FAR-FLUNG FAMILIES . HIS ENGLISH THIRD WIFE, EDNA

MAY, AND HER 20-YEAR-OLD SON PETER, A CAMBRIDGE UNDERGRADUATE, FLEW TO

NAIROBI AND WERE MET BY KENYATTA'S FOURTH WIFE, NGINA, AN AFRICAN, AND

HIS DAUGHTERS MARGARET, 34, AND JANE, 14, BY HIS FIRST WIFE GRACE, ALSO

AN AFRICAN . HIS SECOND WIFE, WHOSE NAME KENYATTA REFUSES TO DIVULGE,

IS SAID TO HAVE DIED ABOUT TWELVE YEARS AGO .

KENYATTA HIMSELF HAS HARDLY SHOWN

ANY COMMUNIST SYMPATHIES, BUT HIS HOME MINISTER, OGINGA ODINGA, IS A

LEFT-WINGER WHO HAS ALREADY SET UP A STATE NEWS AGENCY WITH RUSSIAN AND

CZECH HELP . HE IS PERHAPS BALANCED BY JUSTICE MINISTER TOM MBOYA, WHO

IS AT PRESENT POLITICALLY IN THE SHADE, BUT REMAINS STRONGLY

NATIONALIST AND GENERALLY PRO-WESTERN . AT HOME, KENYATTA MUST RECKON

WITH A POPULATION THAT IS SOARING AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF 3.4 PER CENT ,

AND THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS WITHIN FIVE YEARS TO SETTLE 50,000

AFRICAN FAMILIES ON A MILLION ACRES IN THE " WHITE HIGHLANDS " BOUGHT

FROM EUROPEAN SETTLERS WITH $80 MILLION SUPPLIED BY BRITAIN, BY THAT

TIME AN ADDITIONAL 100,000 FAMILIES WILL BE CLAMORING FOR LAND .

KENYA'S HUGE LABOR SURPLUS MUST IDLY AWAIT THE SLOW DEVELOPMENT OF

INDUSTRY, AND THERE IS A GREAT LACK OF TRAINED PROFESSIONALS TO REPLACE

THE DEPARTING WHITES . FOR EXAMPLE, KENYA HAS 750 DOCTORS BUT NEEDS AT

LEAST 9,000 . THE OUTLOOK . PAINSTAKINGLY, KENYATTA PLEADS WITH HIS

PEOPLE TO ACCEPT HARAMBEE, A SWAHILI WORD MEANING " PULL TOGETHER . "

HE TELLS AFRICANS THAT THEY MUST CONCEDE FULL PARTNERSHIP TO WHITES AND

ASIANS, AND TELLS HIS OWN DOMINANT KIKUYU TRIBE THAT THEY MUST WORK

AMIABLY WITH OTHER TRIBES . THE OPPOSITION KADU PARTY, WHICH ELECTED

ONLY 31 OF THE 130-MEMBER HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, IS FALLING APART AS

MORE AND MORE OF ITS OWN REPRESENTATIVES CLIMB ON THE KENYATTA

BANDWAGON, LURED BY GOVERNMENT JOBS AND PATRONAGE . AS A RESULT, KENYA

WILL PROBABLY BECOME A TYPICALLY AFRICAN ONE-PARTY STATE, BUT PROBABLY

NOT IN SO VIRULENT A FORM AS GHANA OR GUINEA . NO ONE CAN IGNORE THE

DIFFICULTIES AHEAD THE UNEASINESS OF THE REMAINING WHITE SETTLERS, THE

FEARS OF THE ASIANS WHO CONTROL MOST OF THE NATION'S COMMERCE, THE

AGE-OLD TRIBAL RIVALRIES THAT COULD EXPLODE INTO SEPARATISM OR TRIBAL

WAR . BUT THE DEPARTING BRITISH ARE GREATLY IMPRESSED BY KENYATTA'S

GROWING STATESMANSHIP . " ONLY WE CAN SAVE OURSELVES, " HE TOLD HIS

PEOPLE LAST WEEK . " NOBODY ELSE CAN SAVE US . IN THE PAST WE HAVE

BLAMED THE ENGLISHMAN WHEN ANYTHING WENT WRONG . WE SAID HE WAS SUCKING

OUR BLOOD . NOW THE GOVERNMENT IS OURS, AND NOW YOU WILL BLAME KENYATTA

. BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT KENYATTA, BY HIMSELF, CANNOT GIVE YOU

ANYTHING . I URGE YOU TO WORK HARD SO THAT OUR UHURU WILL BE MEANINGFUL

. FROM TODAY ON, OUR MOTTO WILL BE " UHURU NA KAZI (FREEDOM AND WORK) .

REPLACING THE UNION JACK AND ENDING 73 YEARS OF BRITISH RULE IN THE

CLOVE-SCENTED PROTECTORATE OF ZANZIBAR AND NEIGHBORING PEMBA ISLAND .

WITH A POPULATION OF ONLY 300,000 ON THE TWO ISLANDS, ZANZIBAR BECOMES

AFRICA'S SMALLEST INDEPENDENT NATION . FOR MORE THAN THREE CENTURIES,

ZANZIBAR WAS THE JUMPING-OFF PLACE FOR ADVENTURERS AND EXPLORERS AND A

SANCTUARY FOR SLAVERS, WHO CARRIED THEIR BLACK CARGO FROM THE MAINLAND

BEYOND THE RANGE OF AVENGING TRIBES . SWEPT BY THE MONSOONS, DHOWS FROM

THE ARABIAN PENINSULA BROUGHT MOSLEM RAIDERS WHO INSTALLED ARAB SULTANS

AND KEPT THE ISLAND'S BLACK MAJORITY IN BONDAGE CULTIVATING THE CLOVE

GROVES (THE ISLAND STILL SUPPLIES 75 PER CENT OF THE WORLD'S CLOVES) .

TODAY RACE RIOTS SPORADICALLY ERUPT . THOUGH THE ARABS MAKE UP LESS

THAN 20 PER CENT OF THE POPULATION, THEY CONTROL THE ECONOMY, DOMINATE

THE NEW GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE ARAB-LED NATIONALIST PARTY . THE NEW

NATION FACES PRESSING PROBLEMS . THE PER CAPITA INCOME IS ONLY $56 A

GENERAL ELECTION BOTH THE NATIONALIST PARTY AND THE OPPOSITION

AFRO-SHIRAZI PARTY HIRED WITCH DOCTORS TO INFLUENCE THE RESULTS . LIKE

KENYA'S KENYATTA AND UNLIKE SOME OTHER AFRICAN LEADERS PRIME MINISTER

GHANA OUTRAGE AT LAW DICTATOR KWAME NKRUMAH OUTDID HIMSELF

LAST WEEK . HE NOT ONLY FLATLY REFUSED TO FREE THREE POLITICEL

PRISONERS WHO HAD BEEN ACQUITTED BY GHANA'S HIGHEST COURT, BUT HE

SUMMARILY FIRED THE JUDGE WHO HAD PRESIDED OVER THEIR TRIAL . THE

DEFENDANTS, FIVE IN ALL, WERE CHARGED AITH TREASON AFTER NKRUMAH WAS

WOUNDED IN THE SHOULDER BY A BOMB IN AN ATTEMPT ON HIS LIFE IN AUGUST

1962 . THE DICTATOR'S TAME PRESS HAD REPEATEDLY CONDEMNED THEM IN

ADVANCE . BUT CHIEF JUSTICE SIR ARKU KORSAH, WHO HEADED THE THREE-MAN

COURT, CHOSE TO IGNORE THE HINT . AT THE END OF A 51-DAY TRIAL, HE

CONVICTED TWO OF THE ACCUSED, WHO WILL BE HANGED, BUT EXONERATED THE

THREE TOP OFFICIALS WHO WERE CHARGED WITH MASTERMINDING THE CONSPIRACY

. AMONG THE THREE : FORMER INFORMATION MINISTER TAWIA ADAMAFIO, 51, A

LEFTWING, LONDON-EDUCATED LAWYER WHO HAD ONCE BEEN NKRUMAH'S CLOSEST

CRONY . THE PROSECUTION CITED AS " EVIDENCE " THE FACT THAT ADAMAFIO

HAD REFUSED TO SIT BESIDE THE PRESIDENT ON THE DAY THAT HE WAS TO BE

KILLED AND CLAIMED THAT LATER, WHEN NKRUMAH LAY ON A HOSPITAL OPERATING

TABLE, HE HAD TRIED TO ENGAGE HIM IN " WEARISOME ARGUMENT " IN ORDER,

LITERALLY, TO TALK HIM TO DEATH . ALONG WITH THE OTHER DEFENDANTS A

FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER AND A LEADER OF NKRUMAH'S RULING CONVENTION

PEOPLE'S PARTY ADAMAFIO WAS FORMALLY " DISCHARGED " BY THE COURT . BUT

THE TRIO WAS IMMEDIATELY BUNDLED BACK INTO THE CELLS . INTERIOR

MINISTER KWAKU BOATENG CYNICALLY EXPLAINED THAT THE THREE PRISONERS'

ACQUITTAL " WAS THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE JUDICIARY, NOT OF THE

GOVERNMENT, WHICH IS THEREFORE NOT BOUND TO TAKE ANY COGNIZANCE OF IT .

/ ADAMAFIO AND HIS CO-DEFENDANTS WILL REMAIN IN JAIL UNDER A LAW THAT

PERMITS THE GOVERNMENT TO DETAIN ANY CITIZEN FOR TEN YEARS WITHOUT

TRIAL " IN ORDER TO PREVENT HIM FROM ACTING IN A MANNER PREJUDICIAL TO

GHANA'S SECURITY . " LEAPING TO NKRUMAH'S DEFENSE, THE GHANAIAN TIMES

RECALLED FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT'S 1937 ATTACK ON THE U.S . SUPREME COURT,

ADDING : " WE CANNOT HAVE A WIG-AND-GOWN CANTETA WHILE ROME IS BURNING

. THE NATION CANNOT BE BAMBOOZLED BY THE DIABOLIC INSINUATIONS AND

ASPERSIONS OF A CONFUSED AND ANTAGONISTIC JUDICIARY . " NKRUMAH

COMPLETED THE OUTRAGE WHEN, IN VIOLATION OF GHANA'S CONSTITUTION, HE

SACKED SIR ARKU KORSAH, 69, A WIDELY RESPECTED JURIST WHO IN 1956

BECAME GHANA'S FIRST BLACK CHIEF JUSTICE . THE NEWS ASTONISHED EVEN

EGYPT EXODUS FROM NUBIA " WE WENT TO THE GRAVES OF OUR

ANCESTORS FOR THE LAST TIME, " SAID SHEIK AHMED MARDANI . " THE WOMEN

AND CHILDREN CRIED AND WE TRIED TO CONSOLE THEM, BUT WE KNEW OUR HOMES

WERE LOST AND OUR LIVES CHANGED FOREVER . " SHEIK MARDANI'S LAMENT WAS

FOR HIMSELF AND 100,000 OTHER NUBIANS IN EGYPT WHO LAST WEEK WERE

BEING EVACUATED FROM THEIR ANCESTRAL HOMELAND ON THE NILE BANKS . THE

EXODUS WAS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE ASWAN HIGH DAM, BEING BUILT BY EGYPT

WITH RUSSIAN HELP, NEXT SPRING WILL BACK UP THE NILE, CREATING A HUGE

1,800-SQ.-MI . RESERVOIR THAT EVENTUALLY WILL GIVE EGYPT VAST NEW

IRRIGATED ACRES AND ELECTRIC POWER . BUT IT WILL ALSO FLOOD THE GAILY

PAINTED HOUSES OF THE NUBIANS, THEIR CEMETERIES, MOSQUES AND GROVES OF

DATE PALM . WILD VALLEY . IN THEIR WILD, INACCESSIBLE VALLEY, THE

NUBIANS PROSPERED TRANQUILLY FOR CENTURIES UNTIL THE FIRST ASWAN LOW

DAM WAS BUILT IN 1902 . THE RISING NILE WATER DROVE THE VILLAGERS

FARTHER UP THE CLIFFS, AND THE PROCESS WAS REPEATED IN 1912 AND 1933 AS

THE DAM WAS SUCCESSIVELY RAISED TO A HEIGHT OF 182 FT . HALF OF NUBIA'S

30,000 ARABLE ACRES WERE LOST AND THE REMAINING 15,000 COULD ONLY BE

HASTILY CULTIVATED WHEN THE NILE WAS LOW . AS THE LAND VANISHED, NUBIAN

MEN SOUGHT WORK IN THE CITIES, WHERE THEIR PROVERBIAL HONESTY AND

FANATICAL CLEANLINESS WON THEM JOBS . NOW, AT THE RATE OF 300 A DAY,

THE REMAINING NUBIANS ARE BEING MOVED DOWNSTREAM FROM THEIR VILLAGES TO

THE KOM OMBO AREA, SOME 40 MILES NORTH OF ASWAN . THE GOVERNMENT OF

PRESIDENT GAMAL ABDEL NASSER, DETERMINED TO MAKE A SHOWPIECE OF KOM

OMBO, IS AT WORK ON 25,000 HOUSES, 138 STORES, 33 MOSQUES AND 36

SCHOOLS . THE HOUSES HAVE BEEN BUILT LARGELY TO THE NUBIANS' OWN

SPECIFICATIONS, WITH HIGH-WALLED PATIOS, ANIMAL PENS, 12-FT . CEILINGS

AND UP TO FOUR BEDROOMS PER HOUSE . THEY WILL SOON BE ADORNED WITH

KING PAUL, AND AT GREEK VOTERS WHO HAD ENDED HIS EIGHT-YEAR

ADMINISTRATION, KARAMANLIS ABRUPTLY EXILED HIMSELF TO PARIS . NO

WATCHDOG . THOUGH CONSERVATIVE KARAMANLIS WAS THE ABLEST PREMIER IN

RECENT GREEK HISTORY, KING PAUL AND QUEEN FREDERIKA CONSIDERED HIM

HIGHHANDED (HE THOUGHT THE SAME OF THE QUEEN) ; THEY ALSO OPPOSED HIS

IDEAS OF REFORMING THE CONSTITUTION TO GIVE THE PREMIER STRONGER

EXECUTIVE POWERS . IN JUNE, WHEN THEY REJECTED KARAMANLIS' ADVICE TO

CALL OFF A SCHEDULED STATE VISIT TO BRITAIN BECAUSE OF POSSIBLE LEFTIST

DEMONSTRATIONS, HE RESIGNED AND SPENT THREE MONTHS IN A SWISS VILLA .

RETURNING TO RUN FOR RE-ELECTION, HE WAS NARROWLY DEFEATED BY WILY,

MIDDLE-OF-THE ROAD GEORGE PAPANDREOU, 75 . KARAMANLIS WANTED TO QUIT

THEN, BUT WAS DISSUADED BY HIS POLITICAL ALLIES AND THE KING, WHO

CONVINCED HIM THAT AS LEADER OF HIS MAJESTY'S LOYAL OPPOSITION HE WOULD

BE DEMOCRACY'S WATCHDOG . BUT KARAMANLIS WANTED TO BE TOP DOG, AND HE

GROWLED AT EACH NEW MOVE THAT BOOSTED PAPANDREOU'S POPULARITY . THE NEW

PREMIER FROZE RENTS, LAVISHLY PROMISED ALL GREEKS A FREE EDUCATION,

DECLARED A MORATORIUM ON FARMERS' DEBTS, OFFERED WAGE BOOSTS TO JUST

ABOUT EVERYBODY . HE GAVE UP THE PREMIER'S LIMOUSINE ( " WE CAN BUILD

FOUR VILLAGE SCHOOLS WITH THE MONEY " ), OPENED HIS OFFICE ONCE A WEEK

TO PETITIONERS WHO SWAMPED HIM WITH GRIPES, JOB REQUESTS, EVEN DEMANDS

TO SPEED UP THEIR DIVORCES . THOUGH ANTI-COMMUNIST PAPANDREOU ALSO

MANAGED TO PLEASE LEFTISTS . HE PROMISED TO FREE MOST OF THE 1,000

POLITICAL PRISONERS, IN JAIL SINCE THE END OF THE COMMUNIST CIVIL WAR

IN 1949 . HE ALSO COMPLAINED, ACCURATELY, THAT THE GREEK DEFENSE

BUDGET, AMOUNTING TO 5 PER CENT OF ITS GROSS NATIONAL INCOME, IS HIGHER

THAN THAT OF OTHER SMALL NATIONS, IN NATO, CALLED FOR MORE FOREIGN AID

ACTUALLY, THE U.S . IS PLANNING CUTBACKS) . TRIUMPHAL RETURN ? THOUGH

SOME ECONOMISTS HOPEFULLY PREDICTED THAT PAPANDREOU'S SPENDING SPREE

WILL BE COVERED BY RISING NATIONAL INCOME, GREEK BUSINESSMEN WERE

UNEASY . WHEN KING PAUL, SIDING WITH THE NEW PREMIER, AGREED TO

POSTPONE A PARLIAMENTARY VOTE OF CONFIDENCE, KARAMANLIS FUMED ; HE

CHARGED THAT IN DELAYING THE EARLY TEST OF STRENGTH, THE KING WAS

SUBMITTING TO " BLACKMAIL " BY PAPANDREOU, WHO IMPLICITY THREATENED

THAT HIS DEFEAT MIGHT CAUSE POLITICAL DISORDER AND HELP THE LEFT .

FINALLY, KARAMANLIS SUMMONED HIS CLOSEST POLITICAL AIDE AND TOLD HIM :

/ I'M RETIRING AND LEAVING GREECE TOMORROW . " HE BOOKED SPACE UNDER A

FALSE NAME ON A FLIGHT TO PARIS . ONLY AFTER KARAMANLIS AND HIS WIFE

HAD DEPARTED DID HIS NATIONAL RADICAL UNION GET THE WORD . STUNNED,

THEY ELECTED A NEW PARTY CHAIRMAN AND TOOK WHATEVER COMFORT THEY COULD

FROM A LETTER THEIR LEADER HAD LEFT BEHIND : " WHEN A STATESMAN KNOWS

WHAT IS BEST FOR HIS COUNTRY BUT CANNOT CARRY IT OUT, HE MUST, INSTEAD

OF COMPROMISING WITH HIS CONSCIENCE, RETIRE . " KARAMANLIS APPARENTLY

HOPES THAT IF PAPANDREOU MAKES A MESS OF THINGS HE CAN RETURN FROM

EXILE IN TRIUMPH . IN THE EVENT OF NEW ELECTIONS, HIS SUPPORTERS ARE

READY TO CAMPAIGN UNDER THE SLOGAN " BRING KARAMANLIS BACK . " AS FOR

PAPANDREOU, HE CLAIMS TO BE LOOKING FORWARD TO A NEW VOTE, CONFIDENT OF

HOPE FOR LIBERALIZATION OF NATIONAL IMMIGRATION POLICIES, WHOSE

PRINCIPAL VICTIMS ARE THE PARENTS AND CHILDREN OF MIXED MARRIAGES . ONE

WATCHED WITH AMAZEMENT, MORE THAN 400 AFRICAN STUDENTS LAST

WEEK BATTLED RED COPS IN THE STREETS, INSIDE RED SQUARE ITSELF,

RIGHT PAST NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV'S OWN OFFICE WINDOW .

"MOSCOW -- A SECOND ALABAMA," SAID ONE CRUDELY LETTERED SIGN,

IN RUSSIAN AND ENGLISH . "STOP KILLING AFRICANS," WARNED

ANOTHER PLACARD . MOURNING BANDS . THE RACE RIOT WAS

TOUCHED OFF BY THE MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF EDMOND ASARE-ADDO, 29,

A SECOND-YEAR MEDICAL STUDENT FROM GHANA WHO WAS

STUDYING AT KALININ INSTITUTE, ABOUT 100 MILES NORTHWEST OF THE

CAPITAL . ON THE EVE OF HIS MARRIAGE TO A RUSSIAN GIRL, THE STUDENT'S

BODY WAS DISCOVERED NEAR THE RAILROAD TRACKS OF A SUBURBAN MOSCOW

STATION . THE SOVIET POLICE CLAIMED THAT ASARE-ADDO, DRUNK, HAD

FALLEN DOWN IN THE 11 DEGREE-BELOW-ZERO WEATHER AND FROZEN TO

DEATH . BUT GHANAIANS, WHO KNEW THAT THE MARRIAGE WAS FIERCELY OPPOSED

BY THE GIRL'S RUSSIAN FRIENDS, INSISTED THAT THE YOUTH WAS STABBED

BELOW THE CHIN AND TOSSED INTO THE SNOW . QUICKLY SWINGING INTO ACTION,

STUDENTS AT PATRICE LUMUMBA FRIENDSHIP UNIVERSITY SPREAD THE WORD TO

OTHER AFRICANS IN LENINGRAD, KALININ, AND AS FAR AWAY AS ODESSA AND

TASHKENT . THE MESSAGE:  WE MARCH ON THE KREMLIN . WEARING THE

TRADITIONAL RED MOURNING BAND OF GHANA AROUND THEIR HEADS, THE STUDENTS

GATHERED BEFORE THE GHANA EMBASSY ON A STREET A MILE FROM RED SQUARE .

"NO TROUBLE," SHOUTED THEIR LEADERS AS THE PROCESSION TROOPED OFF, BUT

AT THE END OF THE STREET, THERE WAS PLENTY . SOVIET POLICE HAD

BARRED THE WAY WITH TRUCKS AND CARS . WHEN THE COPS REFUSED TO BUDGE,

THE CROWD BEGAN ROCKING A POLICE CAR, INTENDING TO FLIP IT OVER .

ANXIOUS TO AVOID BLOODSHED, AND OUT-NUMBERED 100 TO 1, THE POLICE GAVE

WAY AFTER A BRIEF SCUFFLE . AS ENGLISH-SPEAKING RUSSIAN

YOUTHS -- MEMBERS OF THE YOUNG COMMUNIST LEAGUE -- BLOCKED THE VIEW

FROM WESTERN PHOTOGRAPHERS, THE STUDENTS REGROUPED, MARCHED

THROUGH THE HEART OF MOSCOW SINGING FREEDOM SONGS . BUT THE POLICE

REGROUPED TOO, AND NEAR RED SQUARE, OFFICIALS COMMANDEERED MORE

TRUCKS TO BLOCK THE ENTRANCE . LOUDSPEAKERS BLARED "ENTRY TO RED SQUARE

IS CLOSED," BUT THE AFRICANS SQUEEZED THROUGH A SPACE BETWEEN TWO

TRUCKS; AS TWO STUDENTS DROPPED A POLICEMAN WITH A FLYING TACKLE,

OTHER MARCHERS GRAPPLED WITH COPS ON TOP OF THE VEHICLES .

"IT'S NATURAL ." ONCE AGAIN POLICE GAVE WAY . THE HORDE RACED ACROSS

RED SQUARE, UP AN INCLINE NOT FAR FROM NIKITA'S WINDOW (HE WAS OUT

INSPECTING AN ECONOMICS EXHIBITION), PAST LENIN'S GRANITE MAUSOLEUM, AND

ON TOWARD THE HISTORIC SPASSKY GATE THAT LEADS TO THE INNER KREMLIN

GROUNDS . AT THAT MOMENT THE HUGE IRON GATES CLANGED SHUT . USING

SOUND TRUCKS, THE POLICE PLEADED WITH THE STUDENTS TO DISPERSE, BUT FOR

TWO MORE HOURS THEY ARGUED AND JOSTLED WITH POLICE . OGLING THE

DEMONSTRATION WERE THOUSANDS OF RUSSIANS, WHO WATCHED FROM THE STREET

AND FROM THE WINDOWS OF GUM, THE BIG STATE-OWNED DEPARTMENT STORE,

UNTIL EMPLOYEES CURTAINED OFF THE UNCOMRADELY SCENE .

WORD ABOUT THE RIOT ALL MOSCOW WAS TALKING ABOUT . FINALLY,

IZVESTIA ISSUED A STERN WARNING TO THE STUDENTS, TOLD THEM TO "RESPECT

SOVIET LAWS" OR GET OUT OF THE COUNTRY . PRAGUE HAS ERUPTED IN TWO

RACE RIOTS WITHIN TWO YEARS . LAST FEBRUARY IN SOFIA, BULGARIAN

MILITIAMEN WIELDED CLUBS AGAINST 200 GHANAIANS WHO WERE MARCHING DOWN

THE MAIN STREET DEMANDING NOTHING MORE THAN THEIR OWN CAMPUS

ORGANIZATION . IN MOSCOW, AFRICANS HAVE BEEN SMOLDERING FOR YEARS

OVER THINLY DISGUISED RACIAL DISCRIMINATION . EXCEPT FOR A TOKEN NUMBER

OF RUSSIAN STUDENTS, THE DINING ROOMS AND DORMITORIES OF LUMUMBA U .

(WHICH AFRICANS SARDONICALLY CALL "APARTHEID U .") ARE SEGREGATED .

AFRICANS FIND IT DIFFICULT TO DATE A RUSSIAN GIRL . STUDENTS SQUIRM

AT THE STARES THEY GET IN PUBLIC AND OBJECT TO POOR SERVICE THEY OFTEN

RECEIVE IN RESTAURANTS . DESPITE PROFESSIONS OF BROTHERHOOD, MANY

RUSSIANS STILL THINK AFRICANS ARE HALF-CIVILIZED STRANGERS WHO HAVE

JUST EMERGED FROM THE JUNGLE . " WE TOO ARE PEOPLE, NOT ANIMALS," CRIED

ONE SIGN CARRIED BY STUDENTS WHO SURGED THROUGH MOSCOW'S STREETS LAST

WEEK . TO WHICH ONE RUSSIAN REPLIED, OBVIOUSLY GROANING UNDER THE WEIGHT

OF THE IMPERIALIST WHITE MAN'S BURDEN:  "WE HELP THEM AND GIVE THEM

AN EDUCATION . THEN THEY TURN AGAINST US ."

COMMUNISTS       THE SPHINX ANYONE?  THE MOST RELUCTANT

RUBBERNECK IN EGYPT LAST WEEK WAS COMMUNIST CHINA'S PREMIER CHOU

EN-LAI . GRANTED ONLY THREE SESSIONS WITH PRESIDENT NASSER DURING

HIS WEEK'S SOJOURN IN CAIRO, CHOU WAS PROPELLED RELENTLESSLY

THROUGH THE LIST OF VIP TOURIST ATTRACTIONS:  AN AUTOMOBILE PLANT,

A MUSEUM, EGYPT'S MILITARY ACADEMY, THE ASWAN DAM . WHEN HIS

HOSTS INSISTED ON A CLOSE-UP INSPECTION OF THE SPHINX, CHOU ASKED

PLAINTIVELY:  "DO I HAVE TO GO?  I'VE ALREADY SEEN IT FROM A

DISTANCE ." THOUGH THE VISIT TO EGYPT WAS ONLY THE FIRST LEG OF HIS

SCHEDULED TWO-MONTH SWING THROUGH AFRICA, THE ROUND OF SIGHTSEEING

CLEARLY TIRED THE AILING, 67-YEAR-OLD CHOU . FOR THE FIRST TIME,

WESTERNERS NOTICED THAT HE HAS ONLY PARTIAL USE OF HIS RIGHT ARM,

WHICH WAS USUALLY CLUTCHED TIGHTLY OVER HIS STOMACH . AT ONE POINT,

AFTER CLIMBING A FLIGHT OF STAIRS AT AN ASWAN POWER STATION, THE

ASHEN-FACED PREMIER STAGGERED OFF INTO A CORNER AS IF HE WERE ABOUT

TO FAINT . ONE OF TWO DOCTORS IN HIS ENTOURAGE HURRIED OVER AND

APPEARED TO GIVE HIM A WHIFF OF SMELLING SALTS . AS CHOU RAISED HIS

HEAD, BLOOD TRICKLED FROM HIS NOSE . "IT HAPPENS WHENEVER HE GETS

TIRED," SHRUGGED ONE OF HIS AIDES . "IT IS NOT SERIOUS, BUT THAT

IS WHY HE ALWAYS HAS A DOCTOR WITH HIM ." CHOU NONETHELESS HAD

PLENTY OF ENERGY FOR SPEECHMAKING, HARPED REPEATEDLY ON THE PEKING

VERSION OF MOSCOW'S WE-WILL-BURY-YOU REFRAIN . INDEED, TO

HEAR CHOU, THE AFRO-ASIANS WILL BURY NOT ONLY THE WEST, BUT RUSSIA AS

WELL . "THE ASIAN AND AFRICAN PEOPLES," HE PROCLAIMED, "THROUGH

THEIR LABOR AND INTELLECT CREATED ILLUSTRIOUS CIVILIZATIONS WHICH WERE

DEMOLISHED BY IMPERIALIST AGGRESSION AND TYRANNY . NOW THAT WE HAVE

BROKEN THE IMPERIALISTIC SHACKLES, WE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK NEW

MIRACLES ." FOR ALL HIS EAGERNESS TO WIN AFRICAN SUPPORT FOR PEKING'S

SIDE IN THE SINO-SOVIET CONFLICT, HOWEVER, CHOU COULD OFFER LITTLE

CASH TO THE UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES . IN SOME AREAS THAT THE

CHINESE HAVE CULTIVATED, THEY MAY EVEN END BY MAKING MORE

ENEMIES THAN FRIENDS . BY LENDING SOMALIA $20 MILLION TO BUY ARMS FOR

ITS CAMPAIGN TO GRAB ADJACENT TERRITORY, PEKING HAS ANGERED NEIGHBORING

KENYA, WHERE IT HAS ALSO SPENT HEAVILY TO WOO THE NEW NATION . IT MAY

SUCCEED AT LEAST IN RAISING RUSSIA'S ANTE IN AFRICA AND ASIA . AT

WEEK'S END, AS CHOU LEFT FOR ALGERIA, NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV WAS

REPORTEDLY PLANNING HIS OWN SWING THROUGH AFRICA . BEFORE

VISITING CAIRO NEXT SPRING, HE MAY ALSO JUNKET TO INDIA AND

NEPAL ON CHOU'S BACK DOORSTEP . THEN IT WILL BE NIKITA'S TURN

TO TELL WHO WILL BURY WHOM .

COLD WAR     IMPROVED BALANCE      ANY SURPRISES AT NATO'S YEAR-END

MINISTERIAL CONFERENCE IN PARIS WERE PURELY ACCIDENTAL . AN

ELEVATOR GOT STUCK IN THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE ALLIANCE, BRIEFLY

TRAPPING A DOZEN PHOTOGRAPHERS . THEN U.S . DEFENSE SECRETARY ROBERT S .

MCNAMARA NARROWLY MISSED SUDDEN DEATH WHEN THE FOUR-ENGINE JET

CARRYING HIM FROM ORLY AIRPORT TO SAIGON BRAKED TO A JOLTING STOP ON

THE RUNWAY, JUST IN TIME TO AVOID COLLISION WITH AN INCOMING PLANE .

AS FOR THE MEETING OF NATO'S DEFENSE, FINANCE AND FOREIGN

MINISTERS, IT WENT SO SMOOTHLY THAT THE SESSION ADJOURNED AFTER

ONLY TWO DAYS, A DAY AHEAD OF SCHEDULE . GENTLE REMINDER .

MCNAMARA, IMPRESSIVE AS USUAL, TICKED OFF A FEW AWESOME FACTS OF

U.S . NUCLEAR POWER:  MORE THAN 2,000 ATOMIC WARHEADS READY IN CASE

OF WAR, A 100 PER CENT INCREASE IN TWO YEARS; 500 SAC BOMBERS AND

500 INTERCONTINENTAL MISSILES, WITH 1,000 MORE MISSILES BY 1966;

A NEW 155-MM . NUCLEAR HOWITZER TO BOOST THE POWER OF ARMY GROUND

FORCES, WHOSE MANPOWER HAS BEEN RAISED BY 45 PER CENT WITHIN TWO

YEARS . IN A GENTLE BUT UNMISTAKABLE REMINDER TO U.S . ALLIES, THE

PENTAGON CHIEF SAID THAT UNLESS THEY HIKED THEIR OWN CONTRIBUTIONS

TO NATO, CONGRESS AND U.S . PUBLIC OPINION WOULD BECOME INCREASINGLY

RESTLESS OVER WASHINGTON'S FAR HEAVIER SHARE OF THE WESTERN DEFENSE

BURDEN . IN A SENSE, THE FAMILIAR DISCUSSION OF MILITARY

PREPAREDNESS WAS OVERSHADOWED BY NATO'S "GENERAL RECOGNITION," AS

SECRETARY-GENERAL DIRK STIKKER SUMMED IT UP, "OF CHANGE IN THE

ATMOSPHERE OF WORLD AFFAIRS ." BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY R. A . BUTLER

ECHOED A COMMON VIEW THAT IN THE WAKE OFTHE KREMLIN'S RETREAT IN

THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS, THE SOVIETS "HAVE RENOUNCED THE POLICY

OF HIGH RISKS IN DEALING WITH THE WEST ." U.S . SECRETARY OF STATE

DEAN RUSK, WHILE WARNING THAT THE COMMUNISTS COULD CREATE NEW DANGERS

WITH UNPREDICTABLE AND PERILOUS SPEED, HINTED THAT THE ARRAY OF

PROBLEMS FACING RUSSIA MAY MAKE IT FAR EASIER FOR THE WEST TO REACH

AGREEMENTS WITH THE REDS . THE PROBLEMS INCLUDE THE DEEPLY

SIGNIFICANT RIFT WITH RED CHINA, THE SLACKENING OF REVOLUTIONARY ARDOR

AT HOME, AND THE SOVIET UNION'S GROWING DOMESTIC ECONOMIC TROUBLES .

JANE'S VERDICT . NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV HAS STRETCHED HIS NATION'S

RESOURCES DANGEROUSLY THIN, THE 1964 AND 1965 BUDGETS PUBLISHED IN

MOSCOW LAST WEEK SHOWED SHARP CUTBACKS IN PLANS FOR SUCH KEY

SECTORS OF HEAVY INDUSTRY AS STEEL AND ELECTRIC POWER IN ORDER TO

DIVERT MASSIVE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO THE LAGGING AGRICULTURE PROGRAM

AND THE BACKWARD CHEMICAL INDUSTRY . PERHAPS THE LACK OF CAPITAL

WAS ALSO THE CAUSE OF THE DECLINING RATE IN RUSSIA'S AIR AND SPACE

SPECTACULARS . THE LATEST EDITION OF JANE'S ALL THE WORLD'S AIRCRAFT

LISTS ONLY ONE NEW SOVIET PLANE FOR 1962 -- A HIGH ALTITUDE

RECONNAISSANCE PLANE LIKE THE U-2 . JANE'S ALSO SUGGESTED THAT

RUSSIA'S HIS AND HER SPACE-TWIN FLIGHTS "FAILED TO ACHIEVE ALL THEIR

OBJECTIVES, WHICH MAY HAVE INCLUDED ORBITAL RENDEZVOUS," POINTED OUT

THAT THE RUSSIANS, IN ADDITION, LOST CONTACT WITH THEIR ROCKET PROBE OF

MARS . U.S  . PROJECTS, ALTHOUGH BEGUN WITH MORE MODEST OBJECTIVES,

FAR EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS, THE REPORT STATED, CITING MAJOR GORDON

COOPER'S 22-ORBIT FLIGHT AND THE MARINER II PROBE THAT RELAYED A

WEALTH OF DATA ABOUT VENUS . "WITH THE GREAT SATURN BOOSTER DUE TO

BECOME OPERATIONAL IN 1964-65," JANE'S ADDED, "THE SUGGESTION

THAT AMERICA AND THE SOVIET UNION SHOULD WORK TOGETHER ON MAJOR

PROJECTS LIKE LUNAR EXPLORATION IS BOTH TIMELY AND SENSIBLE NOW THAT THE

PROSPECTIVE PARTNERS ARE ATTAINING A MEASURE OF EQUALITY .

INSPECTION VISIT IN THREE MONTHS . JOINED BY U.S . CENTRAL

INTELLIGENCE AGENCY CHIEF JOHN A . MCCONE, MCNAMARA PLUNGED INTO

BRIEFINGS AT THE U.S . MILITARY MISSION . THEN HE SPENT AN

AFTERNOON CONFERRING WITH BIG MINH AND THE OTHER JUNTA CHIEFS . UNDER

DISCUSSION WERE PLANS FOR A MAJOR NEW OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE VIET CONG .

BEFORE BOARDING HIS PLANE FOR HOME, MCNAMARA TURNED TO VIETNAMESE

DEFENSE MINISTER MAJOR GENERAL TRAN VAN DON WITH SOME STERN

WORDS OF ADVICE . "NOW," SAID MCNAMARA, "LET'S BE REAL TOUGH ."

INDIA     SEA LAWYER     EVER SINCE RED CHINA'S SURPRISE ATTACK A

YEAR AGO, INDIA'S TRADITIONAL POLICY OF NEUTRALITY HAS BEEN MORE

HONORED IN WORDS THAN IN DEEDS . WHILE MOUNTING THE OLD HOMILIES ABOUT

NONALIGNMENT, INDIA HAS PETITIONED THE WEST FOR $1.5 BILLION IN

MILITARY AID AND HAS AGREED TO A WESTERN AIR-DEFENSE UMBRELLA . LAST

WEEK THE U.S . SEVENTH FLEET PREPARED TO TAKE UP POSITIONS IN THE

INDIAN OCEAN . THE QUESTION WAS BROACHED TO INDIAN PRIME MINISTER

JAWAHARLAL NEHRU BY CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF MAXWELL D .

TAYLOR ON A VISIT TO INDIA LAST WEEK . UNDER THE PROPOSAL, A TASK

FORCE OF ONE AIRCRAFT CARRIER WITH NUCLEAR BOMB-CARRYING JETS

AND FOUR ESCORT SHIPS WOULD PATROL IN THE INDIAN OCEAN FOR TWO TO

FOUR MONTHS AT A TIME . SUPPLIED BY SUPPORT VESSELS, THE TASK

FORCE WOULD NEVER HAVE TO TIE UP AT ANY INDIAN PORT FOR PROVISIONS .

PREDICTABLY, THE SEVENTH FLEET PROPOSAL STIRRED UP PROTESTS . THE

INDIAN PRESS MAINTAINED THAT THE PLAN WAS ANOTHER THREAT TO INDIAN

NEUTRALITY, PAKISTAN CLAIMED THAT IT WAS A HOSTILE GESTURE ON THE

PART OF BOTH COUNTRIES, AND RED CHINA SAID THAT IT WAS ANOTHER

EXAMPLE OF THE SUBVERSION OF INDIA BY WESTERN IMPERIALISTS . AS FOR

NEHRU, HE PERFORMED LIKE A SEA LAWYER IN LUKEWARMLY ENDORSING THE PLAN .

"HOW CAN WE OBJECT TO ANYONE GOING WHERE HE LIKES ON THE HIGH SEAS," HE

ASKED .

CAMBODIA     THE SLUMBERING PRINCE     FORMER U.S . SECRETARY OF STATE

DEAN ACHESON IS ONE OF THE MOST HIGHLY ESTEEMED AMERICANS IN

PNOM PENH . THE REASON DATES BACK TO LAST YEAR, WHEN ACHESON

SUCCESSFULLY

REPRESENTED CAMBODIA BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE IN THE

HAGUE IN A TERRITORIAL DISPUTE WITH THAILAND . LAST WEEK THE U.S .

TRIED TO CAPITALIZE ON THIS FRIENDSHIP IN AN EFFORT TO END ITS ACERBIC

AND SOMEWHAT MYSTERIOUS LITTLE QUARREL WITH CAMBODIA'S VAIN,

UNPREDICTABLE LEADER, PRINCE NORODOM SIHANOUK . THE U.S . WAS RUDELY

REBUFFED . SENDING ACHESON OUT TO CAMBODIA ON A PEACEMAKING MISSION

WOULD BE FINE, DECLARED THE PRINCE, BUT ONLY ON THREE CONDITIONS : 1)

THAT WASHINGTON APOLOGIZE FOR THE U.S . DIPLOMAT WHO DESCRIBED AS "

BARBAROUS " RADIO CAMBODIA'S TASTELESS COMMENTS ON JOHN F . KENNEDY'S

ASSASSINATION, 2) A FORMAL WITHDRAWAL BY U.S . DIPLOMATS OF A QUESTION

ASKING WHETHER THE " CAMBODIAN GOVERNMENT HAD REJOICED OVER KENNEDY'S

DEATH, " 3) AND THE CLOSING DOWN OF A RADIO STATION THAT SIHANOUK

CLAIMED WAS RUN BY CIA IN LAOS OR THAILAND FOR THE PURPOSE OF SENDING

SUBVERSIVE BROADCASTS INTO CAMBODIA . WASHINGTON TERMED SIHANOUK'S

CONDITIONS " TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE . " IN FACT, SIHANOUK IS PROBABLY

ONLY TAUNTING THE U.S . OUT OF FEAR OF THE RED CHINESE AND WANTS TO

AVOID AN OVERT DIPLOMATIC BREAK . SIHANOUK IS STILL ANXIOUS FOR A

GENEVA CONFERENCE TO GUARANTEE CAMBODIAN NEUTRALITY, BUT SUCH A

CONFERENCE IS MEANINGLESS WITHOUT U.S . PARTICIPATION . AS SIHANOUK

HIMSELF SAID LAST WEEK AFTER CLOSING CAMBODIA'S EMBASSY IN LONDON, " IT

APPEARS NECESSARY, WITHOUT A DIPLOMATIC BREAK, TO PUT OUR RELATIONS IN

SOUTH KOREA FATIGUES TO FLANNELS SEOUL WAS DECKED IN ALL

ITS FESTIVE FINERY LAST WEEK AS SOUTH KOREA OBSERVED THE END OF TWO

YEARS, SEVEN MONTHS AND ONE DAY OF MILITARY DICTATORSHIP . BUSES WERE

GARLANDED WITH WREATHS AND NEWLY MADE FLAGS DECORATED STOREFRONTS AND

STREETCARS . THE MIDNIGHT CURFEW WAS LIFTED FOR THE DAY, AND 5,000

PRISON INMATES WERE RELEASED ON AMNESTY . IN A BONE-CHILLING DRIZZLE

BEFORE THE NATIONAL CAPITOL BUILDING, 15,000 SHIVERING SPECTATORS

WATCHED FORMER MILITARY STRONGMAN GENERAL PARK CHUNG HEE, 46, TAKE THE

OATH OF OFFICE AS SOUTH KOREA'S FIFTH CIVILIAN PRESIDENT . PROMISING

NEVER " TO PERMIT THE RESURGENCE OF DICTATORSHIP UNDER ANY DISGUISE OR

PRETEXT, " PARK SAID :. " THE BRIGHT MORNING OF THE NEW REPUBLIC HAS

DAWNED . LET US PUT DEPRESSION, MELANCHOLY, CONFUSION AND PESSIMISM

BEHIND US AND CREATE A NEW HISTORY OF OPTIMISM AND DETERMINATION . "

DESPITE PARK'S RINGING WORDS, THE ONLY REAL CHANGE IN SOUTH KOREA'S

GOVERNMENT IS FROM MILITARY FATIGUES TO CIVILIAN FLANNELS . UNDER THE

NEW CONSTITUTION, THE PRESIDENT HAS ALMOST DICTATORIAL POWERS, AND

THOUGH PARK'S DEMOCRATIC-REPUBLICAN PARTY GARNERED ONLY 34 PER CENT OF

THE VOTE IN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS, THE OPPOSITION WAS SO

SPLIT THAT THE D.R.P . HAS A WHOPPING, 45-SEAT PARLIAMENTARY PLURALITY

. THOUGH PARK PLEADED FOR NATIONAL UNITY, OPPOSITION LEADER YUN PO SUN,

WHO BARELY LOST THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, BOYCOTTED THE ASSEMBLY'S

OPENING SESSION, AND OTHER DISSIDENT ASSEMBLYMEN THREATENED TO

INVESTIGATE THE CORRUPTION PREVALENT UNDER PARK'S MILITARY JUNTA . FAR

MORE MENACING TO PARK IS SOUTH KOREA'S CHAOTIC ECONOMY . IN THE PAST

YEAR, RETAIL PRICES HAVE CLIMBED 40 PERCENT, AND SOME 10 PER CENT

OF THE LABOR FORCE IS UNEMPLOYED . FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES HAVE

PLUMMETED TO $105 MILLION . DESPERATE FOR A NEW DOLLOP OF U.S .

ECONOMIC AID, PARK INVITED A U.S . CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION TO HIS

INNAUGURATION . BUT THE U.S . HAS SLASHED NEXT YEAR'S TOTAL AID

COMMITMENT BY $54 MILLION TO $236 MILLION, HOPES TO PRESSURE PARK INTO

STABILIZING THE ECONOMY . A CONTINUING DICTATORSHIP IN SOUTH KOREA IS

NOT VERY PALATABLE TO THE U.S . BUT WITH HIS DICTATORIAL POWERS, PARK

CAN AT LEAST PROMISE A DEGREE OF POLITICAL STABILITY .
