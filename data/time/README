Ed,

  Well, that's it!  The collection starts with TEXT017, and ends with
TEXT five hundred something (there are 425 documents in all, but there
are gaps in the TEXT numbering).  There are 83 queries.  It looks like
there are still a few slashes and stuff in the text that don't belong
there, but I got out what I could in the time that I've had it.
Please let me know if everything gets through ok.  Each documents file
is about 60K.
