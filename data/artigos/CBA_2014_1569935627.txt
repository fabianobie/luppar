Abstract This paper presents some solutions for the problem of state estimation in Unmanned Air Vehicles
where the sampling time of the measurements are higher than the systems controller sampling time. In this
situation, it is necessary to estimate the position of the aircraft while the GPS does not provide new measurements.
In order to bring the problem closer to reality, it is assumed that there are unknown inputs interfering on the
aircrafts trajectory. The methods that are used to solve this problem should estimate not only the vehicle states
but also the unknown inputs basing itself in a mathematical model of the system. Two methods are suggested as
solution a deterministic one - Guaranteed State Estimation - and a stochastic one - Linear Kalman Filter with
Unknown Inputs. Through simulation analysis both methods are compared.

Resumo Esse artigo se propoe a solucionar o problema de estimacao_de_estados em Veculos Aereos Nao
Tripulados quando o perodo de amostragem das medicoes sao maiores do que o perodo de amostragem do
controlador. Nessa situacao, torna-se necessario estimar a posicao da aeronave enquanto o GPS nao fornece
novas medicoes. Para trazer o problema mais proximo a realidade, assume-se que existem entradas desconhecidas
incidindo sobre a aeronave. Os metodos usados para solucionar esse problema devem nao so estimar os estados da
aeronave como tambem estimar as entradas desconhecidas baseando-se em um modelo_matematico do sistema.
Dois metodos sao sugeridos como solucao um metodo determinstico - Estimacao Garantida de Estado - e
um estocastico - Filtro de Kalman Linear com Entradas Desconhecidas. A utilizacao de ambos os metodos e

for each cycle of the controller (Alamo et al.,
2005). It can be performed using interval analysis
(Jaulin et al., 2001 Jaulin, 2009), which makes
it possible to obtain a guaranteed approximation
of the set for the estimation of all possible states.
The outer bounds of the estimation set, uncertain
parameters and noise are represented by zonotopes (Kuhn, 1998). The procedure presented in
(Alamo et al., 2005) is used in this paper to perform robust localization of a UAV, which brings
an approach for guaranteed state estimation of
discrete-time systems with noise and parameters
bounded description.

Introducao

In closed-loop control it is essential to know
the value of controlled variables when regulating them. For controlling the position of an Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) it is not different, since
it is fundamental to know the UAV localization.
However, when the localization is performed by
using a GPS (Global System Positioning), commonly for this kind of system the control law must
achieve a closed-loop time response faster than
the measurement frequency provided by the GPS.
Therefore, while no new measurements are available, it is necessary to estimate online the position of the aircraft. To further complicate this
situation, when a UAV is flying, its motion is constantly affected by wind disturbances, which are
not usually measured.
On state estimation problems it is important
to know all the inputs that affect a system. Otherwise the estimates will become biased due to
the unknown input parameters. This paper compares two approaches to solve the UAV localization problem Guaranteed State Estimation
(GSE) and Linear Kalman Filter with Unknown
Inputs (LKFUI). Both methods try to infer the
disturbances inputs so that they can be used on
the state estimation problem.
Through the set-membership methodology,
the GSE approach calculates a guaranteed bound

On the other hand, LKFUI provides a less
conservative approach for state estimation. Unlike pure classic Linear Kalman Filter (LKF)
(Kalman, 1960), LKFUI (Darouach et al., 2003)
can deal with problems involving unknown inputs
such as wind disturbances on an aircraft. For
this case, the localization of the UAV is achieved
through the method proposed in (Teixeira et al.,
2008), which presents a generalized approach to
Kalman Filters called Gain-Constrained Kalman
Filtering, in which both LKFUI and LKF are particular solutions.
The remainder of the paper is organized as
follows Section 2 deals with the UAV statespace model used for state estimation. Section 3
presents the solution using GSE method, while the

where A  nn , B  np and G  ns are
known matrices in which n is the number of states
of the system, p is the number of known inputs
and s is the number of unknown inputs. It is assumed that for all i, k  1 the input ui1,k  p
is known. The process noise wi1,k  n is assumed to be white, Gaussian, zero-mean and mutually independent with known diagonal covariance matrix Q. xi,k  n is the state vector,
which should be estimated along with time. The
initial state vector x0,0  n is supposed to be
Gaussian with initial estimate x0,0 and error coxx
variance P0,0
, E(x0  x0,0 )T (x0  x0,0 ), where
E denotes expected value.
Since model 2 uses sampling time s , these
equations can be used iteratively to predict the
systems states for sampling time Ts . Thus, to
predict xkk1 given xk1k1 and all the inputs
ui,k1 and di,k1 for i  1, . . . , Ts s , this prediction can be calculated by finding xiTs s ,k .
By defining h  Ts s , the prediction h samples
ahead of xk1k1 can be calculated as shown below

LKFUI solution is shown in section 4. Simulation
results comparing both methods are illustrated in
Section 5. Finally, section 6 concludes this paper
and provides suggestions of future work.
Technical Preliminaries and Notation
For a certain state variable x, xk denotes the value
of the state at sampling instant k, being xk its estimated value. yk contains the values measured
at instant k, while yk represents the estimation
of the same variable. xkk1 denotes that x at
instant k has been predicted using measured information up to instant k  1. The notation that
will be used for the disturbance will be letter d
and the disturbance at instant k  1 is calculated
at instant k, that is, one sampling time after it
really happened.
Since this work deals with two different sampling times (it is used Ts for the GPSs sampling time and s for the controllers sampling
time, with s < Ts and Ts s  N), xi,k (i 
0, 1, 2, ..., Ts s ) denotes the estimated states of
the system i  s seconds after the instant given
at xkk . Index i deals with increments in the controllers cycles, while index k represents sampling
instants of the GPS. Every time that the predictor assimilates new measurements, xi0,k will be
initialized as shown below
xi0,k  xkk

System Modeling

For the system model it should be noted that two
different sampling times are considered s and Ts .
For the systems sampling time s it is considered
a stochastic linear discrete-time dynamic_system
of the form

where yk  m is the output of the system and
is measured at each time instant k C  mn is
a known matrix and m is the number of outputs.
Moreover, the measurement noise vk  m is as-

The equations of motion of a UAV on a coordinate system defined by the axes x, y and z can
be modeled by using Newtons second law. It can
be assumed that all known exerted forces along
an axis are grouped into a single component (for
example, on the z axis the gravity force can be
grouped with the UAV vertical thrust into a single component). On the x axis it is possible to
dx
use the expression x  Fmx + Fm
, where Fx is the
known net force along the axis x, Fdx is the unknown net disturbance force along the same axis
and m is the bodys mass. The expressions for
the axis y and z can be easily obtained by simply
exchanging x for y and z on the aforementioned
expression.

It is important to notice that the forces Fx ,
Fy and Fz have to be known. These variables
can usually be found from the measurements
of the Inertial Measurement Unit and the rotors angular speeds. Since these angles are obtained by measurements, it is fair to say that
Fx , Fy and Fz are not precisely known. Therefore, the uncertainties of these forces can be expressed
on vector
 by process noise represented

w  w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 w6 .
Beyond that, it should be mentioned that in
the methods to be presented the unknown inputs
are estimated once at each instant of the GPSs
measurement and are denoted by dk1k . When
using equation (3) to estimate xkk1 , the vector
of unknown inputs dk1 possesses its terms equal
to dk1k for all i  1, . . . , h. Therefore, when
calculating GTs dk1 it can be proven that for the
given matrices of equation (6)

Thus, it can be said that GTs dk1 
where the matrix GTs is equal to matrix G of equation (6) except that s is substituted

The affirmation of equation (7) is easy demonstrated for a system that moves along a single axis,
but the idea can be easily extended for the threedimensional system. Thus, considering a system
that moves only along axis x this can be represented by a discrete state space model with two
state variables x and x. Thus, matrices A and
G can be adapted from equation (6) with the reGTs dk1k

The guaranteed state estimation method (Alamo
et al., 2005) used in this work is based on two
steps. The first step concerns on estimating a
bounded state xikk1 for each s seconds. It uses
information from previous states, known inputs
and the uncertainty bounds (described in subsections 3.2 - 3.3). The second step occurs at every
Ts seconds, when the GPS returns a new measurement. In this step the guaranteed intersection algorithm uses the measurements along with
its accuracy to compute an outer bound xkk (subsection 3.4). After the intersection, the result is
adapted by an algorithm to be used in the first
step of the next iteration (subsection 3.5).

Table 1 shows that the LKFUI method worked
better than GSE algorithm on all parameters. By
comparing Figures 5 and 6 it is evident that LKFUI method indeed provided better results than
GSE. Moreover, it can be seen from Figure 7 that
in general LKFUI method provided a better estimation of the disturbance input Fdx .
Basically, the disadage of GSE method is
that it is more conservative than LKFUI, given
that GSE is a deterministic method, while LKFUI
is a stochastic one. While LKFUI trusts on probabilities when including some variable into a set,
GSE worries about being certain that this same
variable belongs to it. Moreover, since GSE is
based on interval algebra, there are some operations of this theory that are computationally ex-
