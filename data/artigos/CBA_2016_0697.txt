Abstract This paper proposes an adaptive_control strategy to solve the path tracking problem of a Tilt-rotor
UAV in load transportation tasks. Initially, a nonlinear dynamic model is obtained through the Euler-Lagrange
formulation and linearized around a reference trajectory in order to obtain a linear parameter-varying model.
Therefore, a discrete linear adaptive_controller based on the LMI approach is designed to ensure closed-loop
stability and increase the systems domain of attraction. In addiction, simulation results are shown to verify the
good performance of the proposed controller in presence of external disturbances and model uncertainties.

Introduction

The several possibilities for UAVs applications
as well the issues related to the development of
these vehicles has attracted the attention of the
academia in the last two decades. Some examples
of applications are precision agriculture, aerial
surveillance, and load transportation.
UAVs are mainly presented in two regular
configurations rotary-wing and fixed-wing. The
rotary-wing aircraft has the ability to take-off and
landing vertically, while the fixed-wing one can
reach high cruising speeds. Seeking to combine
these abilities, the Tilt-rotor structure was proposed. This kind of aircraft is particularly interesting to perform tasks that require fast deployment and access to restricted areas, for example,
search and rescue and cargo transportation.
Tilt-rotor UAVs are underactuated mechanical systems since it has more degrees of freedom (DOF) than actuators. This means that is
not possible to control all DOF at the same instant of time. Hence, the path tracking control
problem must be formulated for tracking some
desired DOF while the remaining ones are kept
stable. The tiltable mechanisms that allows the
thrusters motion, increases the mechanical complexity, when compared with others UAVs. Furthermore, the system model is nonlinear and could
become non-affine at the inputs depending on how
the control inputs are selected. All these features
result in a more complex system modeling leading
to a challenging control design.

Researches dealing with control design for
Tilt-rotors UAVs are recent with few works published in the literature. Some relevant works have
used the follow control techniques model predictive (Papachristos et al., 2013) back-stepping
(Amiri et al., 2013) and robust linear (Donadel
et al., 2014). On the other hand, only Almeida
and Raffo (2015) addresses the load transportation problem considering a Tilt-rotor UAV. Although, if different UAVs structures are considered, many works dealing with the load transportation control problem can be found in the literature (Sreenath et al., 2013 Faust et al., 2013).
Generally, aerial vehicles presents highly nonlinear dynamic behavior, making linear controllers
based on the nominal linearized model unsuitable
to perform flight control even in a limited operating range. Gain-scheduled controllers are a technique widely used to obtain a system with higher
domain of attraction and then overcome this issue. However, in some frameworks it is not trivial
to ensure stability for the global system controlled
by a gain-scheduled controller.
Therefore, this paper presents a discrete linear adaptive_controller designed to perform path
tracking of a Tilt-rotor UAV at the rotary-wing
flight mode while carrying a suspended load stably. The adaptive_control law schedule the feedback gain using an optimal convex combination of
individual gains obtained using a polytopic representation to describe the nonlinear system as an
uncertain linear system.

System Model

2.1

This section briefly describes the equations of motion for a Tilt-rotor UAV with suspended load
through the Euler-Lagrange formulation. More
details about the model formulation can be found
on Almeida and Raffo (2015).
The complete system can be seen as a multibody system the Tilt-rotor UAV composed by
three bodies (a main body and two thrusters
groups) and the suspended load being the fourth
body. For modeling purposes, all bodies are assumed rigid and the load is assumed to be attached to the main body by a massless inelastic
rod on a spherical joint. Moreover, each thrusters
group is composed by a rotor to generate the lift
force and a servomotor to tilt the propellers.
Six frames are defined to describe the Tiltrotor UAV motion the inertial frame I, and the
moving frames B and Ci , which are, respectively,
frames rigidly attached to the main body and the
center of mass of the i -th body (see Fig. 1).

The nonlinear dynamic model of the Tilt-rotor
UAV with suspended load can be described by the
Euler-Lagrange equations as

The position of the body frames origin repre0

and the attitude by      , described by Euler angles using the ZYX convention about local
axes. The orientation of C2 with respect to B is obtained by a rotation R around the YB -axis and
a constant negative tilt angle  around the XB axis. Likewise, the rotation of the frame C3 with
respect to B can be obtained considering rotations
L around the YB -axis and a constant tilt angle 
around the XB -axis. Further, using a parametrization that considers the load as a pendulum with
length l and two degrees of freedom represented by
1 and 2 (rotations around XB -axis and YB -axis,
respectively) the position of the suspended load
with respect to the main body becomes a simple
forward kinematic problem.
Therefore, the generalized coordinates that
describe the motion of the Tilt-rotor UAV are defined as q  0  0 R L 1 2 0 . Furthermore, the

Once this work addresses the path tracking problem through a linear control strategy, the statespace model (3) must be linearized around a reference trajectory. Therefore, consider the vehicle in hovering without any external disturbances
(d  0). The equilibrium points can be obtained
after solving x  f (x, u, t)  0, leading to the
system of algebraic equations B (q) u  G (q)  0,
 denotes the equilibrium.
where ()
Nevertheless, this algebraic system has more
variables than equations meaning that an infinity set of real numbers can solve the problem.
To overcome this issue, let the states x, y and
z assume any value along the trajectory and let
  0. Thus, the equilibrium values for the states
and system inputs can be obtained. The reference
trajectory
can be expressed as xr (t)  qr0 qr0

xr yr zr   0 R L 1 2 xr yr zr 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 .

Likewise, rearranging (2) and evaluating
at reference trajectory, it is possible to express the reference control signal as ur (t) 
B + (qr ) M (qr )qr + C(qr , qr ) +  qr + G(qr ), be+
ing () the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse.
Finally, the linearized model can be obtained

Uncertain Linear Model

3.1

After solve the partial derivatives it turns out that
A(t)  R2020 is a function of xr , yr , and zr , and
B(t)  R204 is a constant matrix. Thus, the linear parameter-varying model obtained in (4) can
be written as x  A(xr (t), yr (t), zr (t))x + Bu.
Considering the reference accelerations xr , yr ,
and zr as bounded uncertainties, the uncertain linear model can be expressed in the polytopic form

where    is a vector of uncertain parameters
and  is a polytope with 23 vertices. Thus, the

2.4

Integral Action

In order to perform path tracking with null
steady-state error when constant disturbances affect the system, integral action acting on some
desired states must be considered. In this work
the integral action is applied to x, y, z, and .
Consider the vector   x  xr y  yr z  zr
  r 0 . Adding to the state vector the integral
of , it is possible to obtain integral action. Thus,
the new state-space model is given by

where 0 is a zero matrix with appropriate dimension. Therefore, the augmented state-space can

Since a discrete controller will be considered,
it is necessary to map (6) from the continuous time
to the discrete time domain, leading to xk+1 
Ad ()xk + Bd uk , where the matrices Ad ()
and Bd are obtained after discretize the model using a zero-order hold with sample time T .

Adaptive Controller

This section deals with the problem of designing a
controller able of solving the path tracking problem for a Tilt-rotor UAV. The main objectives are
to ensure stability for the closed-loop system and
reject constant external disturbances and modeling uncertainties. The controller developed in this
work is based on Gonzalez et al. (2010).
1 The reader should note that, for the sake of simplicity,
the symbol () was omitted in (6). Thus, for now on, x
will represent the extended state vector.

Control Problem Formulation

An adaptive_control law that reach the proposed
objectives can be defined as uk  K () xk ,
where the feedback gain is defined as a convex
combination of each individual feedback gain calculated for each vertex of the polytope, that is
K() , 1 K1 + 2 K2 +    + N KN .

(7)

Consider the error model given by xk+1 
(Ad () + Bd K ())xk , the goal is to obtain
K () that ensures asymptotic stability and reach
some performance specification.
Therefore, consider the following Lyapunov
function V (xk )  x0k P xk , where   R+
is a scaling factor. In order to obtain an asymptotically stable system, the conditions P > 0 and
V (xk+1 )  V (xk ) < 0 must be satisfied.
Aiming to add some performance requirements to the problem, V (xk ) is considered as
an upper bound for the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) cost function. Thereby, the closedloop system dynamics with an adaptive_control
law should be as close from the LQR controller
performance as the optimization problem achieve.
Therefore, the following problem is considered
V (x0 )  min

To obtain some valid linear matrix inequalities (LMI) conditions through (8), consider as necessary condition to asymptotic stability and performance the inequality below


x0k A0f P Af xk  x0k (P )xk
 x0k (Q + K 0 ()RK()) xk ,

(9)

where Af  Ad () + Bd K ().
Since (9) is not a valid LMI condition, the
inequality needs to be manipulated. Hence, rearranging (9) and applying the Schur complement
twice (Alamo et al., 2006), it holds that

In order to remove the nonlinear terms, it is
necessary to pre and post multiply (10) by
the

block diagonal matrix blkdiag P 1 , I, I, I , and
to define S  P 1 , Y ()  K()P 1 .
Thus, the LMI condition used to calculate a

Likewise, it is possible to obtain a LMI condition to constrain the control signal amplitude.

However, first it is needed to map the control signal amplitude to the maximum increment of control.
Consider the upper and lower admissible control signals, respectively, uup and ulb  the maximum increment of control can
be defined as

um , min ur  ulb , uup  ur . Then, the LMI
condition can be obtained by solving

Adding the constraints presented in (5), the
following optimization problem must be solved in
order to obtain the  vector

uk  K()xk < um .

This section presents the simulation results obtained by applying the proposed adaptive_controller to perform path tracking of the Tilt-rotor
UAV carrying a suspended load. Since the system is underactuated, only x, y, z, and  are
tracked, and the remaining DOF are stabilized
around their equilibrium points.
The discrete linear model used for controller
design purposes is obtained with sampling time
T  12 ms, which is chosen regarding the hardware and actuators features. The maximum absolute acceleration for x, y, and z is 2.5 ms2 .
The propellers can deliver thrusts in the region
0  fR , fL  30 N and the servomotors are able
to apply torque 2  R , L  2 N.m. Further,
the maximum state error considered in (19) is
e  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0.5 0.5, where the linear error is given in meters and the angular error in
radians.
The system physical parameters are the distance between the frames B and Ci given in meters by dB1  0.00433 0.00060  0.04559, dB2 

(12)

Considering also the problem to determinate
the maximum value of a linear function with ellipsoidal constraints (Alamo et al., 2006) as follows
a  max K()xk , s.t x0k P xk  1,
xk

(13)

for which the solution is given by
a 

p
K()P 1 K 0 ().

(14)

Thus, a sufficient condition to solve (12) is
K()P 1 K 0 () < (um )2 .

(15)

The LMI condition to constrain the control
signal amplitude is obtained rearranging (15) and
applying the Schurs complement, which yields to

where f1  1 0    00 , f2  0 1    00 , and so on.
Consider again the problem of obtain the

In this scenario, the ability of the proposed controller to reject constant disturbances is tested
while tracking a reference with low accelerations. The reference trajectory is given by x 
1.25 cos((50)t), y  1.25 sin((50)t), z  3.5 
2.5 cos((50)t), and   0. The system undergoes the external disturbances shown in Table 1.
Fig. 2 shows the 3D trajectory of the Tiltrotor UAV and Fig. 3-6 show the systems DOF.
Observe that the proposed controller was able to
track the desired trajectory and keep the remaining DOF stable around the equilibria. Although in
Fig. 4-6 the system stabilizes in equilibrium values distinct from those presented in this section, it
should be noted that the disturbances makes the
equilibria changes over time. In addition, Fig. 7
shows the control input applied to the system.
The table 2 shows the mean squared error
(MSE) and the integral of absolute value of the
control derivative (IADU) to compare the proposed controller and the LQR. Clearly, the LQR
controller presents better performance with less
control effort. This is expected once the system,
even in the presence of disturbance, stays near to
the nominal system, i.e., the system considering
null accelerations.

The problem of finding a feasible solution to
the LMIs presented in (11), (16), and (19) is solved
using the YALMIP solver. Also, the optimization
problem (21) is solved using the MATLABs linprog solver with an interior-point algorithm.
In order to analyze the proposed controller,
a LQR controller is designed to compare the systems closed-loop response in two different simulation scenarios. The LQR controller is obtained
using the same Q and R matrices proposed above.

Conclusion

The simulation results show that the proposed
adaptive_controller is able to stabilize all states
and reject external disturbances, ensuring the
path tracking of the Tilt-rotor UAV carrying a
suspended load. When comparing to a linear controller based on the nominal system, the proposed
controller has worst performance near to the nominal model, i.e., for small accelerations. However
when the system operates far from the nominal
case, i.e., with high accelerations the considered
adaptive_controller is better than controllers based
on the nominal model because it increases the system domain of attraction allowing the system to
work in a greater operational range.
Although this work addresses only the control
problem of a Tilt-rotor UAV operating in rotarywing flight mode, in the future the problem of
transition between modes and path tracking in airplane mode will be considered to propose a complete solution to the load transportation problem.

This scenario simulates the system behavior when
subject to accelerations around 2.5 ms2 . Consider the reference trajectory given by x 
3 cos((4)t), y  3 sin((4)t), z  4  4 cos((4)t),
and   0. Fig. 8 and 9 show, respectively, the
3D trajectory and the control input applied to the
system. Unlike the adaptive_controller, in this scenario the LQR controller was not able to stabilize
the system because it is designed for the nominal
linearized system.
The adaptive_controller presented in this work
can be seen as a gain-scheduled controller able to
ensure asymptotic stability over all operating region considered. Fig. 10 clearly shows how the
optimization problem expressed in (21) schedule
the system in order to obtain the best linear representation for the current realization.
