Abstract This paper presents LMI conditions for stability analysis and synthesis of robust and gainscheduled state feedback controllers for discrete-time linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems. It is assumed
that the system matrices have a homogeneous polynomial dependence of arbitrary degree on the time-varying
parameters. The parameters are assumed to vary inside a polytope and have known bounds on their rate of
variation. The geometric properties of the polytopic domain are exploited to derive a finite set of linear matrix
inequalities (LMIs) that take into account the bounds on the rates of variation of the scheduling parameters. The
LMI conditions are obtained using a quadratic in the state Lyapunov function with a homogeneous polynomial
dependence on the scheduling parameters at successive instants of time. Numerical results show the benefits of
the proposed approach.

that is usually conservative for practical applications, since it allows arbitrarily fast variation
of the scheduling parameters. To alleviate some
of the conservatism associated with the quadratic
stability based approaches, parameter-dependent
Lyapunov functions have been used in the following works piecewise Lyapunov matrices are
considered in Leite and Peres (2004) and Amato et al. (2005) linear and affine structures are
used in Daafouz and Bernussou (2001), Montagner et al. (2005a), Oliveira and Peres (2008) and
De Caigny et al. (2010a) homogeneous polynomial parametrization are used in Montagner et al.
(2009), Oliveira and Peres (2009) and De Caigny
et al. (2010b) and affine path dependence in Lee
and Dullerud (2006), Lee (2006) and Oliveira and
Peres (2009). The proposed work extends the
previous results by combining the homogeneous
polynomial dependence and the affine path dependence providing a new parametrization for the
Lyapunov function with a homogeneous polynomial dependence at successive instants of time on
the scheduling parameters.

Introduction

Control theory for linear systems in terms of linear
matrix inequalities (LMIs) have been intensively
investigated. It has been shown that a wide range
of control problems can be described in terms of
LMIs (Gahinet et al., 1995 Lofberg, 2004 Boyd
et al., 1994 Apkarian and Tuan, 2000).
For linear parameter varying (LPV) systems
whose parameters vary inside a polytope, the
conditions for stability analysis and synthesis of
feedback controllers, based in the existence of a
Lyapunov function, can be described in terms of
LMIs that depends on the time-varying parameters, called scheduling parameters. These LMI
conditions must be satisfied for the entire parameter space, thus, generating an infinite set
of LMIs (infinite-dimensional problem), that are
not numerically tractable. To arrive at a finite
dimensional set of LMI conditions, a classic approach called quadratic stability, uses a constant
Lyapunov matrix (Kaminer et al., 1993 Bernussou et al., 1989 Montagner et al., 2005b). However, it produce a finite dimensional set of LMIs

The goal of the paper is to provide LMI con-

ditions for stability analysis and synthesis of robust and gain-scheduled state feedback controller
for discrete-time LPV system with time-varying
parameters belonging to a polytope. The system matrices are assumed to have a homogeneous
polynomial dependence of arbitrary degree on the
scheduling parameters. The geometric properties
of the polytopic domain are exploited to derive a
finite set of LMI conditions that take into account
the bounds on the rate of variation of the scheduling parameters. This conditions are based in the
existence of a homogeneous polynomial path dependent Lyapunov function.
This paper is organized as follows Section 2
presents the notations and terminology used. Section 3 presents the modeling of the uncertainty
domain. Section 4 presents LMI conditions for
stability analysis. Section 5 presents LMI conditions for control synthesis. Section 6 presents the
numerical results.

Notation and terminology

3.1

Let N denotes the set of nonnegative integers
and N+  N  0 the set of positive integers.
Let N, n, m, g  N, v  (v1 , . . . , vn )  Rn and
  (1 , . . . , n )  Rn . The scalar v  is defined
QN
as the product v   v11 . . . vnn  i1 vii . The
QN
scalar (v) is defined by (v)  i1 vi !, where
n! denotes the factorial of n. The inequality v  
denotes vi  i for i  1, . . . , n. The usual operations v + and v  are defined element-wise. The
symbol  represents the symmetric block. The
set K(N, g) denotes the set of N tuples obtained
from all possible combinations of N nonnegative
integers whose sum is g.
Definition (Homogeneous polynomial) A polynomial p(v) is called homogeneous polynomial of
degree g if all its monomials have the same total
degree g. For example, let g  3, N  2, v  R2 ,
and   R2 , then

Modeling of the Uncertainty Domain

From (3), it is clear that i k is a function of
i k, i  1, . . . , N . Following the ideas presented
in Oliveira and Peres (2009), the region where
the vector i k assumes values as a function
of i k, taking into account the bound b, is presented in Figure 1.

K(2,3)

is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 3.

Finally, using the Cartesian product1 of the

the vectors hj (vertices) and discarding the vertices that not satisfy (2) and (5), it is possible to
model the region in the (k, k)-space where
the vector k assumes values as a function of

This parameter dependent matrix is a homogeneous polynomial of arbitrary degree g at L successive instants of time on the scheduling parameter k. This new structure is a combination
of two parameterizations the homogeneous polynomial dependence (Montagner et al., 2009 De
Caigny et al., 2010b) with the affine path dependence (Lee, 2006 Oliveira and Peres, 2009). The
same structure (8) is also used for the slack variable G(k).
Using the change of variables (6) and the
structure (8) for the Lyapunov matrix P and the
slack variable G, it is possible to represent the
LMI (7) in the -space. The necessary manipulations for rewriting the matrices A(k), P (k),
P (k + 1) and G(k) respectively as a function of A(k), P (k), P (k) and G(k), are

The proof of Lemma 1 is omitted since it

The above LMI condition consist in evaluating the parameter dependent LMI for all k 
N , which leads to an infinite set of LMIs (infinite dimensional problem) that is not numerically tractable. However, a finite dimensional set
of LMIs can be derived imposing some particular
structure on the Lyapunov matrix P (k) and on

Robust stability analysis is also investigated
in Oliveira and Peres (2009) for discrete-time
affine parameter dependent systems (case p  1)
using two different parametrizations for the Lyapunov function (i) a homogeneous polynomial dependence of degree g on the scheduling parameter
(ii) an affine dependence at the L successive instants of time on the scheduling parameter. The
main contribution of the present paper is the fact
that the degree g and the path length L are simultaneously used in the parametrization of the
Lyapunov function, thus generalizing the previous
results.

The proof of Theorem 4 is omitted since it is
similar to the proof of Theorem 3.
If the path length is L  1 and the degree of
the system matrix is p  1, Theorem 4 reduces to
Theorem 5 from Oliveira and Peres (2009). In the
case L > 1, the state feedback controller provided
by Theorem 4 requires information about future
values of the scheduling parameter, since the same
homogeneous polynomial path dependent structure (8) used for the Lyapunov matrix P (k) is
also imposed on the slack variable G(k) and on
the parameter dependent gain K(k).

one has an affine path dependence, and for L > 1

This paper presents new LMI conditions for stability analysis and synthesis of both robust and
gain-scheduled state feedback control for discretetime LPV systems. The LMI conditions are derived using a homogeneous polynomial path dependent Lyapunov function. Numerical results
show the benefits of the proposed approach. The
parametrization used for the Lyapunov matrix can
be extended to account for the H2 and H performance.

For fixed L  1, the maximum value of the
scalar  increases with the degree g for both control designs as presented in Table 1 and Table 2.
Although for the robust feedback case, presented
in Table 1, the results for L  1, g  3 did not improved compared to L  1, g  2. For fixed g  1,
the maximum value of the scalar  increases with
the path length g for both control designs. Similar
results for the particular case L  1 with g varying
and g  1 with L varying are found in Oliveira and
Peres (2009). The maximum value of  in both
tables correspond to the case L  2, g  2. For
the robust feedback design, the maximum value is
  0.6663 and for the gain-scheduled design, the
maximum value is   2.5597.

The numerical complexity of the LMIs can be
analyzed counting the number of scalar variables
(V ) and the number of LMI rows (R) involved.
Table 3 presents the numerical complexity of the
LMI conditions of Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 for
the six cases. It is clear that both V and R increase

Appendix
This section presents the necessary manipulations
for writing the system matrix A(k) in the space. The manipulations for all the other matrices, P (k), P (k + 1) and G(k), follows
similar steps and thus are omitted. Recall that
the system matrix A(k) has the following homogeneous polynomial dependence
