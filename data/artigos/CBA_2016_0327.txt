Abstract This paper presents a proposal for attitude_control of a quadrotor using a cascade_control architecture. The control objective is to maintain the quadrotor at a fixed position in three-dimensional space using
the available onboard sensors. The control strategy consists of using an inner loop to stabilize the orientation
and the height of the quadrotor and an outer loop to stabilize the horizontal position using the linear speeds as
reference signals.

Introduction

The widespread and increasing use of drones in
many different applications is now a reality. We
are concerned with the high number of accidents
already reported with both civilian and military
drones. For instance, from 2003 to 2013 US military drones were involved in around 400 accidents
during operations (Whitlock, 2014). Among the
causes, the premature deployment of not enough
tested devices and the suppression of some security subsystems or sensors in order to get quickly
a new product with less cost are noteworthy in
the engineer perspective. We consider thus that
the investigation of drone technology and control
techniques is a relevant task.
One of the most fundamental control task
when considering a drone system is the attitude
control. It is an essential control loop that regulates angular orientations and linear speeds of
the device in order to make it more stable to perform high level control tasks. For instance, by
making first the drone being stable in a fixed 3D
space position it is possible to, in a higher level
control loop, make it move from one point to the
other or to follow a specified trajectory. The attitude_control is fundamental for both remote piloting and autonomous flight. It relies mostly onboard sensors like an inertial measurement unit
(IMU), equipped accelerometers, rate gyros and
magnetometers, or additional onboard sensors like
barometers or sonars.
We work with quadrotors for some reasons.
First, currently there are many affordable drone
systems based on quadrotors. Second, because
the control actuation is relatively simple, based

ISSN 2525-8311

on the speeds of the rotors. Nevertheless, the task
to control them is still a challenge. Quadrotors are
underactuated nonlinear_systems with coupling of
control modes and many difficulties in modelling,
like the aerodynamics of propellers. Third, when
compared with other drone systems, the quadrotor can perform interesting maneuvers like vertical
take off and landing (VTOL) or hovering. Moreover, they are suitable for indoors or outdoors environments. We work with the Crazyflie platform
from Bitcraze 1 , a light (19g) and very small (9
cm from rotor to rotor) open source platform.
We can find a lot of works that deal with
attitude_control of quadrotors such as (Mueller
and DAndrea, 2014 Tayebi and McGilvray, 2006
Raffo et al., 2009 Basri et al., 2014 Martin and
Salaum, 2010 Bouabdallah, 2007 Hanna, 2014
Costa, 2012 Borges et al., 2015 Lebedev, 2013).
Our model is based on the modelling presented
in (Beard, 2008 Lebedev, 2013). However, we
have obtained a relatively satisfactory control result by ignoring the air resistance and the rotor drag proposed on (Hanna, 2014 Leishman
et al., 2014 Martin and Salaum, 2010), the uncertainties in (Basri et al., 2014) and the quaternions in (Tayebi and McGilvray, 2006 Borges
et al., 2015).
In this work we propose an attitude_controller
that tries to exploit the maximum possible from
the quadrotor onboard sensors by maintaining the
quadrotor at a stable 3D position in space. The
control objective is to maintain the quadrotor at
a fixed position in three-dimensional space using
the available onboard sensors. For instance, the

Crazyflie has an accelerometer, a rate gyro, a magnetometer and a barometer. Using the onboard
sensor fusion routines (Martin and Salaum, 2010)
we can obtain relatively accurate estimates of the
quadrotor angular orientation and height. We
propose a two layered attitude_control where we
use additional information on the linear speeds.
It can be shown that without the feedback of the
linear speeds, it is not possible to attain to a fixed
3D position (Lobo e Silva, 2016).
This paper is organized as follows In section
2 we report the modelling of the quadrotor. In
section 3 we describe the linearization of the system. In section 4 we explain the synthesis of the
inner and outer loops controls. In section 5 we
show the simulation results of the outer loop control. In section 6 we present a tracking test of the
controllers implemented on the Crazyflie and in
section 7 we show our conclusion.

where kf and kt are the thrust and torque constants.
For control purposes, we define the total
thrust (F) and the roll ( ), pitch( ) and yaw
( ) torques as
F  F1 + F2 + F3 + F4
  l(F4  F2 )
  l(F1  F3 )
  1 + 3  2  4

where l is the distance from the rotors to the center of mass.
The following set of nonlinear equations that
describes the quadrotor dynamics can be obtained
by application of Newton-Euler or Lagrangian
methods as can be followed in (Beard, 2008).

Mathematical Modelling of the
Crazyflie

Figure 1 shows a schematic model of a quadrotor
frame in the cross + configuration . There are
four motors Ri , i  1...4. The front rotor R1 and
the back rotor R3 spin clockwise, the right rotor
R2 and the left rotor R4 spin counter-clockwise.
Figure 1 also shows the main coordinates frames
in this work, the body frame (xb , yb , zb ) attached
to the body of the device and the inertial frame
(xi , yi , zi ) attached to a fixed ground reference.

Figure 1 Crazyflie top view.
The motors generate at the frame a thrust Fi
and a torque i according to the direction of rotation. We suppose that the thrust Fi and toque i
are related to the PWM duty cycle of the actuators i , with i  0, 1, by Fi  kf i and i  kf i ,

Lets start the definition of an equilibrium

The linearized model is composed of simple
first order differential equations. The decoupling
of the variables in (9) is exploited in the control
design. Observe there are four main decoupled
modes, as shown figure 2.

As doing this we will concentrate all the model

controller design in future steps. Second, the generalized forces are now defined in units compatible
to the dimension of the PWM duty cycle.

We call these modes as follows. The height

w and the height h. The yaw mode connects the
yaw torque 0 to the yaw rate r and yaw angle .
The lateral mode connects the roll torque 0 to the
roll rate p, roll angle  and lateral speed v. The
longitudinal mode connects the pitch torque 0 to
the pitch rate q, pitch angle  and longitudinal
speed u. We will exploit this decomposition in
the controller design.

Controller Design

Overview

We work with a cascade_control architecture. An
inner loop is responsible for stabilization by regulation the Euler angles , ,  and the vertical height h. It can be shown that this controller
solely is unable to stabilize the quadrotor at a horizontal position. Considering the possibility of estimating the linear speeds u and v from accelerometer data, as indicated in (Leishman et al., 2014),
we propose an external control loop to regulate the
horizontal speeds u and v. The outer loop uses u
and v as reference to determine the set point for
the inner loop. Besides, it is possible to use different control strategies for the outer loop unaffecting the inner loop. The proposal architecture is
then shown in figure 3.
4.2

Inner Loop

We consider the following controllers for the inner
control loop the Pitch control regulates the pitch
angle  the Roll control regulates the roll angle
 The Yaw control regulates the yaw angle .
These three controllers use data from the sensor
fusion algorithm. Finally, Height control uses the
vertical speed to stabilize the height.

can be decoded into the rotors PWM duty cycle 1  F00 + 0 and 3  F00  0 , where we use
F00 , mgkf as the standard value to maintain the
quadrotor in the air. From this, we can see that
the control action of the other controller loop act
as disturbances. In order to make the integral control, all the system were augmented of one integral
state as indicated in (Franklin et al., 2013). The
controllers gains and closed loop poles are shown
in table 1.

Figure 3 Decoupling mode.

In this paper we describe only the pitch mode
synthesis. The roll, yaw and height modes are
analogous to the pitch mode.
According with equation (9), the pitch mode
corresponds to the following state-space representation

The structure of the pitch controller is defined

reference r is given to the desired pitch angle .

Outer Loop

For the outer control loop we consider the following modes The U controller inspired in the dependence of u and  in equation (9), and the V
controller inspired in the dependence of v and 
in equation (9).
The structure of the U controller is defined in
figure 5. As well as pitch controller, the U control
has a full state feedback with robust tracking by
integral error. The reference ur is given to the
desired longitudinal speed u. The main idea is to
use the output of the U controlles r as a reference
to the pitch controller. The V mode is analogous
to the U mode.

In the control scheme of figure 4, the integral
state is defined by
I    r

Then, the resulting control law is

(12)

Observe that the control law consists implicity
of a proportional action KP P , an integral action
KIP and a derivative action KDP .
The inner loop controllers were sinthesized using the LQR techniques (Franklin et al., 2013).
The LQR weighting matrices were adjusted by
checking the steps response of the system. One
of the main constrains was to maintain the control action 0 in order to maintain the PWM duty
cycles i in the range 0,1. From equation 8, we
can estimate that the generalized pitch torque 0

The U and V controllers were also sinthesied
by LQR. The weighting matrices were adjusted by
trial and error, by observing system step response.
The restriction were to make the U and V dynamics slower than the inner loop and the restriction
on the value as the outputs r and r based on the
typical values of the inner loop controller. The results are in table 2.

Simulations

We perform a simulation of the controllers in
closed loop against the nonlinear model.
As an initial condition to the simulation we
define the following pn  pe  h  0 m, u 
v  w  0 ms,   0.1 rad,   0.3 rad,
  0.2 rad and p  q  r  0 rads. The
reference inputs are ur  vr  hr  0 ms and
r  0 rad. The simulation time is 40s.
The simulation responses of the outer loop
system are shown in figures 6, 7 and 8.
We conclude that the quadrotor hovers in a
fixed position. After 20 seconds, the positions pn
and pe remain in a fix value. All the Euler angles
and all the angular rates have the same settling
time in 5 seconds. Also, due to integral action,
the steady state errors for the linear speeds, the
euler angle and the angular rates are all null. Finally, the values of 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 are between
0 and 1. It can be shown that, without the U and
V controllers, the horizontal position cannot be
stabilized (Lobo e Silva, 2016).

Despite of the wind force generated by the
rotation of the propellers causes oscillations at the
quadrotor, observe that the recorded  tracks the
reference signals.

Implementation and Tests

We have implemented the roll, pitch and yaw controllers on the real quadrotor. First, we tied the
quadrotor between two support columns in a way
to allow only the pitch movement, as in figure 9.
The main idea is to check if the output 
tracks the reference input r . Finally, we have
compared the results of the simulation with the
real recorded data. The results are shown in figure 10. We have obtained similar result for the
roll and yaw controllers.

ISSN 2525-8311

The figure 11 shows a flying performance
data for the attitude_control. The results show
that the h state tracks the reference hr and the
speeds u and v oscillate around the reference signal with maximum values of umax   0.4 ms
and vmax   0.7 ms. Although the outer loop
replaces r and r for ur and vr respectively, the
Euler angles states oscillate close to zero rad.
Due to the arguments presented, the outer loop
provides a good regulation of the position.

mizing the dynamics responses. Also, utilizing the
longitudinal and lateral speeds as reference signals
allow the quadrotor hovers in a fixed height in 3D
space without using external position sensors.
In future work, the authors intend to implement a Kalman Filter for estimating the longitudinal and lateral speeds to improve the performance
of the controller.
