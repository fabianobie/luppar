Abstract In this work, we deal with the problem of designing stabilizing event-triggered state-feedback
controllers for rational plants. Using differential algebraic representations and Lyapunov theory techniques, we
derive LMI-based conditions to ensure regional asymptotic stability of the origin. These conditions can be cast in
convex optimization problems to choose the parameters of the trigger function aiming at reducing the sampling
activity while ensuring the asymptotic stability of the origin with respect to a given set of admissible initial
conditions. The application of the method is shown by means of simulations.

Introduction

Event-triggered control is a paradigm of sampled
control where the data is sampled and the control is updated only when a criterion based on the
state or output of the system is violated. This
way, to achieve a given control objective, typically less updates are needed than with a periodic sampling paradigm. In a networked control
implementation, this represents less transmissions
across the network, reducing the bandwidth and
energy consumption (Heemels et al. (2012), Abdelrahim, Postoyan, Daafouz and Nesic (2015a),
Hespanha et al. (2007) and the references cited
therein).
Event-triggered control strategies have been
addressed in the context of linear time invariant plants in (Heemels et al., 2012), which also
addresses self-triggered control, and in (Donkers
and Heemels, 2012), with an emphasis on decentralized triggering. Event-triggered implementations of PI controllers are addressed in (Gomes da
Silva Jr. et al., 2014) for linear plants and in
(Moreira et al., 2016) for linear plants subject to
saturation of the control input. Stability analysis
of event-triggered PI controllers for first-order stable plants is also presented in (Tiberi et al., 2012)
and (Beschi et al., 2014).
In the context of nonlinear plants, (Tabuada,
2007) shows a trigger criterion that renders
the closed-loop system stable and proves that
this criterion results in lower-bounded inter-event
times. More recently, (Abdelrahim, Postoyan and
Daafouz, 2015) addresses the event-triggered control of singularly perturbed systems when the
trigger has access to the entire state of the

ISSN 2525-8311

system, while (Abdelrahim, Postoyan, Daafouz
and Nesic, 2015a), (Abdelrahim et al., 2014)
and (Abdelrahim, Postoyan, Daafouz and Nesic,
2015b) address event-triggered strategies considering output feedback control laws where the trigger has access only to the system outputs. These
papers use hybrid systems theory to prove stability and include a timer to guarantee a minimum
inter-event time (dwell-time technique).
In the present paper, we address the design of event-triggered control systems for rational plants. Many plants of interest can be modeled as rational, notably in the biological area, e.g.
generic biological systems (Wu and Mu, 2009) and
bio-reactors (Campestrini et al. (2014), Antonelli
et al. (2003)). We consider a triggering strategy
based on a weighted relative distance between the
last sampled state and the current continuous one
the weights are introduced through the use of positive definite matrices. Using differential algebraic
representations (Trofino (2000), Coutinho et al.
(2004), Oliveira (2012)) and the Lyapunov theory, LMI conditions that guarantee the stability
of the closed-loop system for a set of admissible
initial states are derived. A convex optimization
problem is then proposed as means to tune the
parameters of the trigger function aiming at reducing the number of events while keeping the
closed-loop system stable. We cover the so-called
emulation case (Heemels et al., 2012), i.e. when
the controller gain matrix is given a priori and
only the trigger parameters are obtained using the
optimization problem. Numerical experiments illustrate the application of the method.
Notation R represents the set of real numbers. A0 denotes the transpose of matrix A.

Problem 1 Given a static state-feedback matrix
K that stabilizes the origin of the closed-loop system (1), (i.e., a continuous-time implementation
of the control system), devise an event-triggered
strategy that guarantees the asymptotic stability
of the origin for the corresponding event-triggered
implementation (2) for all initial conditions in a
given subset X0 of the domain of attraction of
the origin, while reducing the number of trigger
events.

Problem Statement

Consider an autonomous continuous-time control
system defined by the following equation
(
x(t)  f (x(t)) + g(x(t))u(t)
(1)
u(t)  Kx(t)
where x(t)  Rn is the state vector u(t)  Rm
is the input f (x) and g(x) are rational functions
of the state and are Lipschitz continuous on the
region of interest Bx . We assume that f (0)  0
and that the equilibrium point of interest is the
origin. K  Rmn is a constant gain matrix that
stabilizes the origin of the system.
We consider now that the plant and the controller are in separate nodes and are connected
through a general purpose network forming the
closed-loop system depicted in Figure 1. At instants tk , k  0, 1, 2, . . . , determined by the eventtrigger generator, a sample of the plant state is
sent to the controller node. Between two trigger instants, the controller input is held at the
constant sampled value by means of a zero-order
holder. We assume t0  0. Therefore, the closed
loop system can be represented by the equation
(
x(t)  f (x(t)) + g(x(t))u(t)
(2)
u(t)  Kx(tk )
t  tk , tk+1 )
We aim at designing an event-trigger strategy
that saves communication bandwidth by transmitting data only when necessary, while keeping
the closed-loop system stable. In a more formal
way we can state the following problem to be addressed

Preliminaries

Defining (t)  x(tk )  x(t), we can rewrite (2) as
follows
x(t)  f (x(t)) + g(x(t))K(x(t) + (t))
 f (x(t)) + g(x(t))Kx(t) + g(x(t))K(t)
t  tk , tk+1 )
(3)
Note that at t  tk , the value of (t) is reset to
zero.
In this paper we will use the differential
algebraic representations (DARs) proposed in
(Trofino, 2000). A DAR for (3) is given by
(

x  (A1 (x) + A3 (x)K) x + A2 (x)(x) + A3 (x)K
0  (1 (x) + 3 (x)K) x + 2 (x)(x) + 3 (x)K
(4)

with (x)  Rq being an auxiliary variable containing nonlinear terms of f (x) and of g(x)
A1 (x)  Rnn , A2 (x)  Rnq , A3 (x)  Rnm ,
1 (x)  Rqn , 2 (x)  Rqq and 3 (x)  Rqm
being affine matrix functions of x. It is assumed
that (3) can be recovered from (4) by eliminating
(x), which implies that 2 (x) is full column rank
for all x of interest, i.e. x  Bx . We omitted the
time dependency to simplify notation.
Notice that, since f (x) and g(x) are rational
functions of the state, so is f (x) + g(x)Kx, and
the decomposition of (3) in the form (4) is always possible. The decomposition is not unique
and different choices can lead to different results
(Coutinho et al. (2004), Trofino (2000)).

Sampling strategy

We consider the triggering strategy given by the
following algorithm (Moreira et al. (2016), Groff
et al. (2016))
Algorithm 1 Event-trigger strategy
if  0 (t)Q (t)  x0 (t)Qx x(t) > 0 then
tk  t
u(t)  Kx(tk )
else
u(t)  u(tk )
end if
The term  0 (t)Q (t)  x0 (t)Qx x(t) is a relative measure of the deviation between the last

1145

sampled state and the current one. Q and Qx
are symmetric positive definite matrices of appropriate dimensions that act as weights on this measure. The larger Qx and the smaller Q are,
the more we let the current state deviate from the
last sampled one before sampling again and less
sampling activity is expected. This criterion is a
generalization of the sampling criterion originally
introduced in (Tabuada, 2007). Notice that if we
choose Qx  I and Q  I we basically retrieve
the criterion in (Tabuada, 2007) with 0  
and, as shown in that paper, the larger 0 is, less
sampling activity is expected.

Stability conditions

Assuming that the gain K has been designed
to stabilize the closed-loop system (1) (i.e., a
continuous-time implementation of the control
system), the following theorem establishes conditions to ensure the stability of the event-triggered
implementation using the sampling strategy given
by Algorithm 1
Theorem 1 Consider a convex polytopic region of interest Bx  x  Rn  h0i x 
i  with i > 0 hi  Rn  i  1, . . . , nf  ,
whose vertices are xj  Rn  j  1, . . . , nv .
If there exist constant symmetric positive definite
matrices P, Qx , Q  Rnn and constant matrices
M1 , M2  Rnn and M3  Rqq , such that the
following LMIs are satisfied

We can rearrange the terms of the representation (4) as follows
(
 x + (A1 + A3 K)x + A2  + A3 K  0
(7)
(1 + 3 K)x + 2  + 3 K  0
where we omitted the matrix dependencies on x
for notation clarity. From this, along the solutions
of (4), it follows that
1  x0 M1 (x + (A1 + A3 K)x + A2  + A3 K)  0
2  x0 M2 (x + (A1 + A3 K)x + A2  + A3 K)  0
3   0 M3 ((1 + 3 K)x + 2  + 3 K)  0

M1 , M2 , M3 of appropriate dimensions.
Consider now a quadratic Lyapunov function
V (x)  x0 P x, with P symmetric positive definite.
Defining   x0 x0  0  0 0 and considering 1 , 2
and 3 above, it follows that V (x) can be written
as
V (x)  V (x) + 21 + 22 + 23

we can conclude that V (x) <  0 Q   x0 Qx x  0.
Applying the Schurs complement to a + Qx ,
we obtain that (5) and (9) are equivalent. Hence,
satisfaction of (5) implies that V (x) < 0. Since
(5) is affine on x, satisfying it on the vertices of
Bx implies that it is satisfied in the entire Bx and
that the origin is asymptotically stable.
Satisfaction of (6) guarantees that E(P )  Bx
(see Tarbouriech et al. (2011) for details), making
E(P ) an invariant and contractive set for the nonlinear system (2) and guaranteeing that x(0) 
E(P ) converges asymptotically to the origin. 2

Zeno Solutions

To be of practical use, the triggering schema cannot lead to Zeno solutions (Abdelrahim, Postoyan,
Daafouz and Nesic (2015a), Tabuada (2007),
Heemels et al. (2012)). The following theorem addresses this issue.
Theorem 2 The inter-sampling times implicitly
defined by the triggering schema given by Algorithm 1 are lower-bounded.

which is continuous at t  0. Therefore, it takes a
finite (as opposed
p to infinitesimal) amount of time
to the value 1 be reached. Thus, we conclude
that the inter-sampling times are lower-bounded
by this amount.

Hence, from Theorem 2, we can guarantee
that the proposed triggering strategy does not
generate Zeno solutions.

Trigger tuning

Consider a given region of initial states X0  x 
Rn  x0 P0 x  1, with P0  Rnn symmetric and
positive definite, from where we want to ensure
convergence of the trajectories to the origin. Satisfaction of conditions stated in Theorem 1 and
X0  E(P ) are sufficient conditions to achieve this
goal.
To reduce the sampling activity, we aim at
finding Q as small as possible and Qx as large
as possible. The goal on Q can be accomplished,
for example, by minimizing tr(Q ). Since Qx 
Q1
appears in condition (5), the goal on Qx
x
can be indirectly achieved by minimizing tr(Qx ).
Thus, considering both objectives, we propose the
following optimization problem as means of computing the trigger parameters
min
P,Qx ,Q ,M1 ,M2 ,M3 

subject to

(tr(Q + Qx ))
(15)

(5), (6), P < P0

The last constraint in (15) ensures that X0 
E(P ).
Notice that the choice of Bx impacts on the
results obtained with this optimization problem.
For this reason, one should parameterize Bx (e.g.
as a symmetrical polytope around the origin) and
do a linear search on the parameter (see the numerical example).

Using these values for the trigger parameters,
simulations of the closed-loop system give the results shown in figures 2 and 3. Figure 2 shows
the set X0 (in green) along with the set E(P ) (in
red), some convergent (in blue) and some divergent trajectories (in magenta). Note that the set
X0 is included in the domain of attraction of the
origin and in E(P ), as expected. The estimate of
the region of attraction given by E(P ) is somewhat
conservative, as expected, since the optimization
problem does not aim at maximizing it. In Figure 3, the top plot shows the time evolution of a
simulation with x(0)  0.1 0.10 and the bottom
plot shows the corresponding trigger activity. In
the time interval 0, 15, the trigger generated 64
events with a minimum inter-event time of 144 ms.

In this work we have proposed a method to design
event-triggered control systems for continuoustime rational nonlinear plants. Differently from
previous works, we do not rely on hybrid systems
theory to prove stability and we do not use dwelltime techniques to ensure a minimum inter-event
time. The method is based on the use of differential algebraic representations for rational systems
and guarantees local asymptotic stability of the
origin for a given set of initial conditions. The stability conditions derived are LMIs. Therefore, a
convex optimization problem is proposed to compute the trigger parameters aiming at reducing
the number of trigger events. We addressed the
so-called emulation design, where the controller
gains are given and the design task is to tune only
the trigger function parameters. A numerical example showed the potentialities of the method.
The co-design of the trigger parameters and
the controller gains and use of less conservative
design approaches are subjects of ongoing work.
