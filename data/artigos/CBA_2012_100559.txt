Resumo Este artigo descreve e analisa uma modificação de um algoritmo de controle_adaptativo por modelo
de referência e estrutura_variável (VS-MRAC) previamente introduzido. A modificação proposta permite relaxar
a hipótese de que um limite superior sobre a incerteza nos parâmetros da planta é conhecido e pode ser utilizado
para implementar o controlador. No algoritmo proposto, o valor do limitante superior é substituído por uma
estimativa obtida adaptativamente.

Abstract This article describes and analises a modification of a variable-structure based model-reference
adaptive_control algorithm (VS-MRAC) previously introduced. The modification allows to relax the assumption
that an upper bound on the plant uncertainty is available to implement the controller. In the proposed algorithm
the required upper bound is replaced by an adaptive estimate.

Introduction

Variable structure (VS) is a very successful approach to the robust control of uncertain systems (Utkin 1978), (Edwards  Spurgeon 1998),
(Sabanovic, Fridman  Spurgeon 2004).
One basic assumption usually required to implement a VS control law is that the uncertainty
is bounded and that its bound is available to the
designer. However, due to the lack of information and complexity of the uncertainty structure,
its bound may not be easily obtained. This difculty can be relaxed by employing some kind of
online estimator to obtain an upper bound for the
uncertainty. There are many attempts to solve
this problem reported in the literature. Among
the pioneering are (Yoo  Chung 1992), (Su 
Leung 1993), (Wheeler, Su  Stepanenko 1998),
(Wai 2000), (Chu  Tung 2005). Other recent references are (Yu 2006), (Fei 2007), (Liu 
Gong 2008), (Yeh, Chen  Huang 2010), (Neila 
Tarak 2011).
In this note we focus on the variable-structure
model-reference adaptive_control (VS-MRAC) algorithm introduced in (Hsu  Costa 1989) and
extended in (Hsu 1990, Hsu, de Araújo  Costa
1994, Hsu, Lizarralde  de Araújo 1997). This algorithm is remarkable in the sense that it does not
require the state measurement to be implemented,
has a notable transient behavior, and model following can be achieved in a nite time. The
MIMO extension of the VS-MRAC appeared in
(Hsu, da Cunha  Costa 2001, Cunha, Hsu, Costa
 Lizarralde 2003). Based on this algorithm, a
solution without requiring the knowledge of an
upper bound for the plant uncertainty was given
in (Yan, Hsu  Xiuxia 2006) using the concept
of monitoring function. More recently, (Cunha,

ISBN 978-85-8001-069-5

Costa  Hsu 2008) used rst-order lters to generate appropriate approximations for the signals upper bounds based on optimization methods. Here
we modify the VS-MRAC by adding an adaptive
upper bound estimator for the plant uncertainty.
The main advantage of this modication is the
simplicity of the resulting algorithm. Only the
case of SISO plants with relative degree equal 1
is considered. The analysis shows global uniform
stability of the system.
The well known chattering problem due to
small imperfections in the switching devices is also
considered. Since this phenomena can easily make
the estimated bound to grow unboundedly, a simple and eective dead zone is introduced in the
adaptation mechanism in order to avoid this undesirable eect. Several simulation results are presented to illustrate the behavior of the proposed
algorithm and to conrm the analysis carried out.

Problem formulation

The plant is assumed to be of the form
yp  W (s)u ,

W (s)  kp

Np (s)
,
Dp (s)

(1)

where u is the control signal and yp is the measurable output. The parameters of the transfer
function W (s) are unknown. The following basic
assumptions, which summarize the prior available
information regarding W (s), are granted
(1) n, the order of the plant, is known
(2) the relative degree n  degreeDp (s) 
degreeNp (s)  1
(3) Np (s) is Hurwitz, i.e., W (s) is minimum
phase

(4) the sign of the high frequency gain kp is
known and, without loss of generality, supposed to be positive.
The objective of the design is to nd a control
law u(t) such that yp tracks the output ym of a
model reference (chosen to be of rst order, for
simplicity) given by
ym  M (s)r ,

M (s) 

km
,
s + am

(3)

tends to zero asymptotically for arbitrary initial
conditions and arbitrary piecewise continuous
uniformly bounded reference signals r(t).
The control law is given by
u  T  ,

(4)

2n

where   R is the vector of parameters to be
adapted and   R2n is the regressor vector given
by
(5)
 T  v1T yp v2T r ,
where v1 and v2  Rn1 are obtained using state
variable filters (SVFs) of the form
v1  v1 + gu ,
v2  v2 + gyp ,

(6)

and, since n  1, the matrix  is chosen such
that Nm (s)  det(sI  ).
It is well known that with this parameterization of the controller, and under the assumptions (1)(3), there exists a unique constant vec
 such that the transtor T  1 2    2n
fer function of the closedloop system with u 
T  matches M (s) exactly, i.e., y  W (s)u 
W (s)T   M (s)r.
The closed-loop system (1), (4) and (6) can
be rewriting as (Narendra  Annaswamy 1989)
yp  M (s)r + M (s)k  u  T  +  ,

(7)

where k   (2n

that will be omitted hereafter whenever unessential for the theoretical development. From the
above, one has that the error equation of the system is given by

where, without loss of generality, km > 0 and
am > 0. More precisely, the objective is to design u(t) such that the output error
e0  yp  ym ,

where A, b, cT  is a nonminimal realization of
M (s). Since n  1, M (s) can be chosen strictly
positive real (SPR). Thus, there exist matrices
P  P T > 0 and Q  QT > 0 such that the nonminimal realization A, b, cT  satises (Narendra
 Annaswamy 1989)

Review of the VS-MRAC design

The VS-MRAC is based on signal synthesis. Instead of using adaptive parameters as in standard
MRAC strategy, relays are used to generate the
required control signal. The derivation of the algorithm is as follows (Hsu  Costa 1989).
Consider the following Lyapunov function
2V (e)  eT P e .

(11)

Using (10), the derivative of V along the trajectories of the error equation (9) is given by
2V  eT P e + eT P e
T



 Ae + bk  T  P e + eT P Ae + bk  T 


 eT AT P + P A e + 2bT P ek  T

or better,

T
V  eT Qe + k     e0
 eT Qe + k

i  i i e0 .

(12)

i1

Suppose that the following assumption is veried.
(5) An upper bound for the unknown parameter
i is available, that is,
i > i  , i .

(13)

Under this condition, one can select the
switching law (Hsu  Costa 1989)


i  i sign i e0 .
(14)
This choice reduces (12) to
V  eT Qe  k 

2n



i i e0  + i i e0



i1

< eT Qe < 0 .

(15)

From (11) and (15) it is well known that e(t)
decreases at least exponentially. Moreover, if
(t) > c > 0 ,

t  t0 ,

(16)

for an arbitrary c > 0 and nite t0 , then it can be
shown that e0 (t) goes to zero in a nite time. For
a proof, see (Hsu  Costa 1989).
The resulting control law, obtained from (4)
and (14), is given by

which is negative semi-denite in the (e, )-space.
This implies that V (t) is monotone nonincreasing
along the trajectories of (9) and (19), and that
e  0 as t  . Therefore, the proposed algorithm (18)-(19) assures global uniform stability of
the system.
As a result, the control law is now given by

The idea here is to eliminate the assumption (5).
To do this, the upper bound i in (14) will be
replaced by an adaptive estimate. The proposed

Implementation aspects

Any real switching device has small imperfections
that preclude the existence of an ideal sliding motion. This means that the output error e0 cannot
be made exactly zero after a nite time. Near
the sliding surface, a phenomena called chattering
will take place which can easily make the adaptive parameter  in (19) to grow unboundedly. To
overcome such a situation, a simple and eective
dead zone is introduced in the adaptation mechanism. This way, a practical form of the algorithm
is
i  i ez  ,
where

if e0  <  ,

(23)

(24)

where  > 0 is the width of the dead zone which
should be selected according to the imperfection
on the switching device. For example, if the
switching device is a relay with hysteresis, in this
simple case the dead zone should be selected such
that

It can be observed the low frequency of the
switching and the residual error in e0 caused by
the hysteresis. This illustrates the behavior of the
algorithm in the presence of switching imperfections.

The eect of the hysteresis can be observed in

the parameter  keeps growing. Figure 5 shows
the correcting eect of the introduction of a dead
zone in the adaptive mechanism. Of course, the
dead zone does not alleviate the chattering not reduces the residual output error. It only precludes
the adaptive parameter  to grow unboundedly.

In this paper we have presented a modication
of the VS-MRAC algorithm in order to relax the
usual prior knowledge of an upper bound on the
unknown plant parameters. The new algorithm is
analyzed and shown to be at least globally uniformly stable. This result however comes to a
price, the nite time convergence property of the
original VS-MRAC algorithm is no longer assured.
Several simulations have conrmed the theoretical
results.
The renement of the algorithm to deal with
the presence of noise in the plant and the robustness analysis is left for future works.
