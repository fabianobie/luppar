Abstract The Discrete Barycenter Method is a direct, derivativefree optimization algorithm which uses
the weighted average values of a sequence of guesses to search for minimum points of a function. Good guesses
receive larger weights while bad ones are penalized. The method converges with a superlinear order. Simulations
show that its performance is at least comparable to that of existing methods, and examples of applications to
controller design are presented. Finally, conclusions and suggestions of future work are presented.

Each new estimate is considered in the calculation
of next barycenter, and the goal of the algorithm
is for the sequence of barycenters to converge to a
minimum.
This paper is organized as follows in Section
2, we define the method and its parameters, and
show an equivalent expression that is convenient
for analysis. In Section 3, we prove convergence
and superlinear convergence order. In Section
4, we compare the barycenter method with the
Compass Search Method (Kolda et al., 2003) and
Particle Swarm Optimization (Kennedy and Eberhart, 1995), a metaheuristic method that has become popular in recent years. In Section 5, we design a proportional and a proportional plus derivative (PD) controllers using the Discrete Barycenter Method. Conclusions about the methods performance and directions for future work are presented in section 6.

Introduction

Although the success of derivative based optimization methods, such as Newton, quasiNewton, and
steepest descent is fully demonstrated in many applications, there are cases in which they cannot be
applied, for instance when the derivatives are unavailable or cannot be calculated reliably (Conn
et al., 2008). To solve those problems, one may
use direct search methods, also called derivative
free methods.
Direct search methods arose in the 1950s,
but their golden age was the 1960s (Lewis et al.,
1998), when several successful applications were
proposed. Because of the lack of convergence
proofs, and the fact that direct search methods
were developed heuristically, they suffered neglect
from the mathematical optimization community
(Kolda et al., 2003). Nonetheless, interest in such
methods continued for three main reasons
 Many work well in practice and some are very
intuitive.
 They normally are easier to implement than
derivative based methods.
 They often work well when other methods
fail.

The Discrete Barycenter Method

In this section, we define the main concepts related to the barycenter method.

We present the Discrete Barycenter Method,
a new direct search algorithm that uses a weighted
mean to search for the minimum point of a nonlinear function and solve unrestricted optimization
problems. This weighted mean is found much in
the same manner as in the calculation of the center
of mass of a set of particles. The main characteristic of the recursive version of the method is to

Definition 2.1 (Curiosity) The curiosity of the
method is a nonzero vector b  Rm with random
components bi  0, i  1, ..., m.
Roughly speaking, the higher the curiosity, the
greater the search region, that is, for larger curios-

ity, the method is more appropriate for searching
for a global minimum, and if the curiosity is small,
the method will search locally.

In order to prove convergence in Theorem 2, we
require Lemma 1, which provides a recursive form
for the Discrete Barycenter Method.

with x0 an initial condition.

Proof By induction, for n  1 equation (1)
reads

We wish that the latter sequence approaches
the minimum point. The idea behind the method
is that if the value of objective function is small,
then the corresponding point receives a large
weight and conversely if the value of the function is large, the weight will be small and the
point will contribute little to the barycenter computation. Notice that even if the barycenter approaches the minimum, a high curiosity can take
it away from there. So some modifications in the
method should be implemented.
In the following, we define another parameter
that can be used to improve convergence.

Our main theorem shows that the Discrete
Barycenter Method converges. Ideally, we would
like the limit point to be a minimum of the objective function, but this cannot be guaranteed
without extra assumptions. Issues concerning the
convergence to the minimum will be reported in
a subsequent contribution (Vicinansa et al., 2014,
submitted ).

Note that the convexity of the functions domain guarantees that the barycenters sequence remains inside the functions domain. Moreover, the
barycenter sequence cannot diverge for finite values of n (see footnote 1).
Now we show that the method converges superlinearly.

Theorem 2 (Convergence) Let z(x) be a function from Rm  R+ ,   R+ and bn n the sequence of curiosities, such that bn   M, n with
M  R+ . Let the vector sequences xn n  Rm
and xn n  Rm be generated by the Discrete
Barycenter Method as described in equation (3),
both of them belonging to the functions domain.
Then limn xn+1  xn   0.

Definition 3.1 If the sequence xn n converges
to the point x , the rate of convergence is said to
be superlinear if
x  xn+1

first case occurs when the sequence zn n diverges, which means limn zn  +. Using

Theorem 3 (Order of Convergence ) Let
z be a function from Rm  R+ ,   R+ ,
bn n a limited sequence of curiosities, such that
bn   M, n with M  R+ and bn   r, n
with r  R+ . Then the convergence order of the
barycenter sequence xn n is superlinear.

It is also true that

that the sequence zn n cannot diverge for a finite value of n, because there are no singularities in the
functions domain. Hence, the function can only diverge if
the point xn falls in the domains boundary, but in that
case xn must diverge as well. Once the curiosity sequence is
limited, the sequence xn n can only diverge for a infinite
value of n.

In this section, we use the Compass Search
Method (Kolda et al., 2003), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) (Kennedy and Eberhart, 1995)
and the Discrete Barycenter Method to minimize the Rosenbrocks Function, a traditional
benchmark for derivative-free optimization methods (Conn et al., 2008). The simulations in this
article concern unimodal functions. Simulation
results with multimodal function (Ackleys function) appear in the paper (Vicinansa et al., 2014,
submitted ), using an alternative version of the
Barycenter Method.
The parameters of the Discrete Barycenter
Method are   100000 and   0.5 (shape factor)
and the parameter of the Compass Search Method
is   10. For the PSO, we used the parameters3

same initial point, that is (x0 , y0 )  (0.0, 1.2)

Application to Optimal Controller
Design

In this section, we present applications of the
barycenter method to problems of interest in controls the offline optimal design of closed loop P
(proportional) and PD (proportional plus derivative) controllers for linear time invariant plants.

It has a single minimum at (1, 1) where its
value is zero. After 100 iterations, the Compass Search Method converged to the point
(x, y)  (0.544434, 0.29668) with the corresponding value for the objective function equal to
z(x, y)  0.205895, while the Discrete Barycenter Method converged to the point (x, y)

function value takes in consideration each time that the
PSO method find a new candidate to the minimum point.

be made to assure that

We also apply the Compass Search and the PSO
methods for comparison.

Considering a linear timeinvariant SISO

, with
plant with transfer function G(s)  s(s+a)
a  1 and b  1 and a unit step function as a
reference signal, we used the Discrete Barycenter
Method, Compass Search, and PSO to find a proportional controller that minimizes the cost function for 0  t  1, with the parameters q and r
equal to 1.
The PSO method was used with 5 particles
and 50 iterations. The method parameters are
c1  1.0, c2  1.0 and w  0.5. The method
found a proportional gain k  0.0813761 and
the corresponding cost function value equal to
z(k)  0.985255. For the case of Compass Search,
50 iterations were performed. The parameter is
  1.0. The method found a proportional gain
k  0.133467 and the corresponding cost function value equal to z(k)  0.982671. Finally, we
used the Discrete Barycenter Method with 50 iterations. The parameters are   10000 and Shape
Factor   0.5. The method found a proportional gain k  0.136357 and the corresponding
cost function equal to z(k)  0.982679.
Figure 3 shows the closedloop unit step response for the proportional controller found by
the three methods 1) PSO in green, 2) Compass
Search in blue and 3) Barycenter in red. Figure 4

sake of comparison, in figure 5 the cost function

a small number of steps. The bigger the number
of particles in PSO, the faster the convergence (in
terms of steps) but higher the time between successive steps. In the case of Compass Search, it
was estimated that the execution time was, in average, 1.3 times higher than the Barycenter. Thus,
we can say that, as far as the execution time is
concerned, the barycenter method might have a
similar performance to the compass search method
and PSO, if the parameters of the last one are chosen properly. It is important to say that our aim
is to present a new simple and intuitive method

The methods worked equally well in minimizing the cost. Finding the PD controller took approximately 10 minutes in a personal computer
with CPU AMDTurion X2 Ultra Dual-Core with
memory of 3GB running Mathematica, while PSO
and Compass Search Methods took approximately
20 and 13 minutes respectively. In this particular case, the Barycenter Method outperformed
the others from the point of view of computation
time.

In this article, we presented the Discrete Barycenter Method, a derivativefree approach proposed
by the authors for solving optimization problems, especially those that cannot be solved by
derivative based methods such as Newtons and
gradienttype. We have shown that the method
converges superlinearly, however we could not
yet prove that it will converge to the minimum
point (local or global), if it exists (see (Vicinansa
et al., 2014, submitted ) for a modification in the
method that guaratees convergence to the minimum).
In order to argue that the method reaches the
minimum in practice, we applied it to find the
minimum of the Rosenbrock function, a benchmark function for testing nonlinear optimization
algorithms. We also compared the Barycenter
Method with the Compass Search and PSO (particle swarm) methods. The Barycenter Method
resulted in performance at least as good as the
other two, and in many cases, better. The method
was also applied to designing optimal controllers
offline. Based on the simulations, we could conclude that the Barycenter Method was able to find
quickly an optimal proportional controller for that
cost function with a good precision, after a small
number of iterations. For the case of PD controller, the Barycenter Method performed better.
Future work will analyze conditions under
which the method converges to the actual minimum point, and apply the Barycenter Method to
real time optimization. The goal is to find minima
of functions whose values for specified parameters
can be computed by experiment or simulation, but
whose mathematical closedform expression is not
a priori known. One application we have in mind
is to Adaptive Control, where heretofore methods such as recursive least squares have been employed.
