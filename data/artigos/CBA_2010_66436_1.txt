Introduction

2 Management Model

In Brazil, electrical energy is mainly distributed
through transmission lines, which is difficult in distant regions. Renewable energy sources such as solar
voltaic, eolic, biomass and small hydroelectric plants
are among the best options for places where transmission lines are not viable.
Renewable energy sources can be used in conjunction, constituting a hybrid power generation system. Because it uses more than one primary energy
source, hybrid systems are the ideal way to produce
electrical energy for isolated communities. In this
work, three renewable energy sources were used
solar, biomass and biogas. Solar irradiation data were
obtained from CPTEC (Weather Prediction and Climate Studies Center, 2007), in Corumbá  MS,
where the BEP is located.
Based on Godoy Jr. et. al. (2007), one person
produce around 0.6 kg of waste per day, therefore, it
was possible to obtain the amount of biomass. Also,
it is estimated that one person produce around 0.2 m3
of wastewater per day, which correctly converted can

The model developed in this work was based on
differential evolution algorithm. This algorithm was
used to select the best source of energy among the
possibilities. In the next section a brief description of
this algorithm is presented.
The differential evolution algorithm presents
few variables of control, rapid convergence and simplicity for its implementation as is observed in related works by Storn and Price (1995, 1997).
This algorithm is an evolution of the genetic algorithm proposed by Holland (1975), due to it
presents less importance on the local minimums. It
tries to locate the global optimum using manipulation
of population of solutions. In Storn, Price and Lampinen (2005) are presented several applications using
differential evolution in different fields of engineering and science.

The operation called mutation is performed
through the addiction of a weighted subtraction (between two individual from population related) with
another individual. After this, the new parameters
from this individual are combined with others parameters from other individual through the operation
called cross-over. The last operation is called selection and it is responsible to select the individuals that
will be available in the next generation. This operation use the fitness function of each individual.
There are five parameters which describes the
differential evolution. These parameters are D that
represents the number of dimensions or chromosome
size, which is a design variable that depends on chosen problem NP, population size, and this number
must be larger than four individuals CR, cross-over
constant or probability of cross-over F, mutation
constant. Germax, maximum number of generations, which is used as stopping condition. Figure 1
shows the fluxogram of the proposed algorithm.

The differential evolution algorithm indicates
the source that will be used to attend the load. Two
factors are used to perform this chosen. The first one
is the price. The least price is the most attractive, so,
the algorithm selects a source that presents the least
price in comparison with the others sources. This
price is calculated based on the cost of installation,
maintenance and the capability of storage. The second factor is the availability of each source. These
two factors are called weights. Each source has a
weight. This weight can be calculated using the equation 1.
Weight  ( price.0.6)  ( power  least  power).0.4 (1)

For instance, if one source has almost zero energy, immediately the algorithm sets up a great value to its weight. In other hand, the weight is updated
using the equation (1).
The fitness function is calculated using the equation 2.

To define D, NP, CR, F
and GerMax

F(i )  (weight(i ) . population (i ) )  F(i 1)

To create initial
population

The fluxogram showed in figure 1 is applied
until the stopping criteria is reached. In this case, the
stopping criteria is the maximum number of generations. After this, the algorithm indicates the best
source to supply the demand.

3 Modeling
The BEP was chosen to develop this work because it is located at the Passo do Lontra region, 300
km from Campo Grande, state capital. Even being
located on the Pantanal region, BEP does not use any
source of renewable energy it only uses energy provided by the concessionary.

A. Demand Curve
Wind velocity, temperature and solar radiation
data were collected from CPTEC. Biomass and biogas data were calculated based on the number of
BEPs guests per day. Due to the great amount of
obtained data, a solution was to separate them on
seasons. Table 1 shows the average of the collected
data by seasons.
The demand curve was obtained based on methodologies developed by Cerchiari et. al. (2006).
In Cerchiari et. al. (2006), the author submitted
a demand curves data bank to an artificial neural
network to find resemblance patterns and separate
them into groups. Approximation was used to identify consumers typical demand curves based on the
attributes of the databank.

Yet in Cerchiari et. al. (2006) is presented four
methodologies to obtain typical demand curves consumption extract and consumer type, consumption
extract and grouped consumer type, Fuzzy Method
and grouping analysis.
Based on this, BEPs typical demand curve, for
the day with more guests is shown of Figure 2.

In this work, BB design was made for maximum (65), medium (27) and minimum (2) number of
BEPs guests.
Equation (3) was used determine BBs capacity
with load enough for one day, where daily consumption is divided by bank voltage. To find the number
of batteries it is necessary to choose a load factor and
the battery Ah quantity (4).

Daily consumption was defined by the sum of
generated power (biomass, biogas and solar energy)
subtracted from the demanded power. Daily consumptions are 95,700.00 Wh, 254,400.00 Wh and
329,100.00 Wh, respectively for the maximum, medium and minimum BEPs guests. The calculated
number of batteries for the maximum number of
guests was 67. The number of 177 batteries was
needed for the medium number of guests, and for the
minimum, 229 batteries.
It was verified that 67 batteries are enough to attend most of the loads during the period of one year.
In just one moment neither renewable energy sources
nor BB is enough to attend demand, so the concessionary energy can be used or a small generator
group can be used.

Figure 2. Typical demand curve.

B. Solar Panel Dimensioning
To dimension de number of solar panels the
peak demand method was used, in this case 30 kW.
It was obtained 357 panels, with 43.2 kW and area of
332 m2. However, based on many tests it was observed that using 230 panels of 130 Wp, with area of
214 m2 and 27.8 kW all possible canaries can be
attended, including surplus on the Battery Bank.

4 Developing the Scenarios

C. Battery Bank Dimensioning
The use of the Battery Bank is more common in
small and medium hybrid energy systems, and it is
used to save fossil fuels. It is explained in Bolanos
et. al. (2007) that BB supplies energy when the
amount of renewable energy is not enough.

For each season a typical day scenario was developed. Maximum and medium visitants number occurs during winter, so for this season two scenarios
were developed. One year scenario was developed to

5 Results

C. Scenario 3
For this scenario, BBs overload almost reached
500 kWh. The motive was the demand, because the
number of guests was very small also, solar energy
reached high values because this scenario occurred
during summer. Even with low biomass and biogas
production, the quantity was enough to attend three
demands (Figure 11).

Obtained results were satisfactory. All demands
were attended and the battery bank did not completely discharged any time. For some scenarios, solar
energy surplus were bigger than BBs capacity.
A. Scenario 1
It can be observed that the system chooses the
biomass as the main source in this case due to large
disponibility. After this, the others sources starts to
be used, biogas, solar energy and the BB, respectively.
The BB was activated and for three times there
were overload, but the BB could not be completely
recharged. All demands were attended. Figure 9 presents the attended demand and BBs load during 24

The right dimensioning of numbers of solar panels is essential to no dispend energy, and not spend
excess money buying unneeded equipments.
Using the dimensioning method of peak demand, the number of solar panels would be 357.
Analyzing the results obtained with the modeling of this number, the number of panels was reduced to 230. With this quantity the load is attended
and the surplus energy is used to charge the battery
bank For this work, three battery banks were dimensioned based on the maximum, medium and minimum number of guests of the BEP. It was verified
that 84 batteries, a bank of 150 kWh is enough to
attend the demand. There is just one instant where
the renewable energy sources and the battery bank is
not enough to attend the demand. However it was
just a short instant, so the best solution is to use a
diesel generator or the concessionary energy.
Analyzing the results obtained on the diverse
scenarios it is possible to observe that the use of biogas and biomass is very important. They are used
when there is not enough solar energy and the demand is small, saving the battery bank for peak time.
The differential evolution algorithm uses two
factors to choose which source it will be used to attend the load price and availability. Thus, it can be
observed in scenarios cases showed previously that
the algorithm selects biomass, biogas and solar energy, respectively in this order. These results show
the feasibility and reliability of the proposed system,
which tries to maximize the energy, used from renewable sources and minimizes the energy from fossil
sources.

F. One Year Scenario
During this scenario there was one moment
when the BB was completely discharged and could
not attend the load. However it occurred just one
time and all the other demands were attended, so
there is no need to increase the BB. When it occur a
diesel generator or energy from de concessionary can
be used. The occurrence of zero demands does not
indicate that the demand was attended it may be that
there were no guests in the BEP. Figure 14
represents the attended demand in this scenario and
