Abstract In this paper we present new results for continuous-time Markov jump linear systems
with partial observations on the jumping process. We assume the existence of a suitable detector
which provides measurements of the Markov chain. Our aim is to design a detector-based H
state feedback controller. The proposed design methods, which include an algorithm to treat a
non-convexity issue, are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities and the results are applied to
the control of an unmanned aerial vehicle and a power system.

Introduction

Markov jump linear systems (MJLS) have been
the subject of extensive research over the last few
years and the associated literature is by now fairly
extensive (see, e.g., (Mariton, 1990 Costa et al.,
2005 Dragan et al., 2006 Costa et al., 2013),
and references there in). This class of parameterswitching models has an intimate connection with
systems which are sensitive to abrupt changes in
their structure. On that account, MJLS can be
used in a wide variety of real applications such
as, for instance, in aircraft flight systems, communications networks, robotics, mathematical finance, etc. A fleeting glimpse of works which deal
with application in this field can be found, e.g.,
in (Costa et al., 2005 Costa et al., 2013)(see also,
(Costa et al., 2015)).
Regarding the H approach for MJLS, (de
Souza and Fragoso, 1993 Pan and Basar, 1994
Fragoso et al., 1995), seem to be the first works
dealing with H -control. In the context of H filtering, works can be traced back at least to
(de Souza and Fragoso, 2002a). Most of these
works consider the setting in which the operation mode of the systems is completely accessible. The exceptions in the scenario of partial information of the Markov chain are the
so-called mode-independent case (see, e.g., (de
Souza et al., 2006)), the cluster setting (see, e.g.,
(Goncalves et al., 2009)) and situations involving

parametric uncertainty, in which the partial observation is related to incomplete knowledge of the
transition probability matrix (see, e.g., (de Souza
and Fragoso, 2002b)). For a recent overview on
the state-of-the-art of MJLS with partial observations see, for instance, (Costa et al., 2013).
In this paper, we make some further foray
on the H control problem for continuous-time
MJLS. We consider the case in which we do not
have access to the Markov chain but, instead,
there is a detector that emits signals which provides information on this parameter.
Roughly, the contributions of the paper can
be briefly summarized as follows
1. We devise a detector-based H control approach for continuous-time MJLS with partial
information on the Markovian jump parameter. The detector approach proposed here for
the continuous-time scenario is inspired on
(Fragoso and Costa, 2004 Costa et al., 2015),
which treat, respectively, mean-square stability of continuous-time MJLS and a control
problem in discrete-time. The main results
come in the form of Theorem 2 and Algorithm 3.
2. In order to illustrate an application of the
main results, we present a numerical example
of the H control for an unmanned aerial
vehicle model (see (Ducard, 2009)), as well
the control of a power system model (see
(Arrifano and Oliveira, 2004)).
An outline of the content of this paper is as
follows. In Section 1.1 we provide the bare es-

sentials of notations. The detector-based formulation is presented in Section 2, along with the
H control problem in Section 2.1. In Section
3 we present numerical examples which illustrate
the usefulness of the obtained result. The paper is
concluded in Section 4 with some final comments.

Notation

Throughout this paper we shall denote by Rn the
n-dimensional real Euclidean space and by Rnm
the set of n  m real matrices. The Euclidean vector norm is represented by kk. We also denote by
In the n  n identity matrix, and by R+ the interval 0, ). The superscript  will denote transpose,
Her() , () + () and the symbol  represents
a symmetric block in the linear matrix inequality (LMI). For a real matrix V , V > 0(V < 0)
means that V is symmetric and positive definite
(negative definite). Let (, F , P ) be a complete
probability space carrying its natural filtration
Ft , t  R+ , as usual augmented by all null sets
in the P -completion of F . In addition we denote by Ln2 w (, F , P ) the space of all Ft -adapted
stochastic processes w  w(t) t  R+  in Rnw
such that kwk2 < , where

with E standing for the usual mathematical expectation.
Let x  x(t) t  R+  in Rnx denote the
state variable, z  z(t) t  R+  in Rnz the
systems controlled output and w  w(t) t 
R+   Ln2 w (, F , P ) an exogenous disturbance
input. We also define   ((t), Ft ), t  R+ 
as a time-homogeneous Markov process with right
continuous trajectories, taking values on the finite
set S , 1, . . . , N . For small h > 0 we have that
n

where   (ij ) is the homogeneous N N transition rate matrix
P of  with ij  0, i 6 j and
i  ii 
jj6i ij . Here o(h) denotes an
infinitesimal of higher order than h.

The detector-based H approach

The interest in this paper is on the situation where
the process  cannot be known precisely, but instead a measurement , which is provided by a
suitable detector, is available at all times. In this
context, we extend the detector formulation introduced by (Costa et al., 2015) in the discrete-time
setup, and consider a finite set D , 1, . . . , M 
and subsets Di  D such that a signal (t)  Di
is emitted whenever the Markov chain (t)  i,
independently of all previous and present values
of the other processes.

the following continuous-time MJLS

Notice that Di represents the possible signals

M   1 +    +  N such that Di , i1 , . . . , i i  
D. Thus  i represents the number of elements in
Di and ij , j  1, . . . ,  i , the elements in Di .

Remark 1 The detector-based formulation covers some of the better studied particular scenarios considered in the MJLS literature. Next, we
briefly present how to access these particular settings from the aforementioned detector.

1. The scenario with complete observations of
the jump process is equivalent to the situation
where   . In our context, it can be determined by considering M  N and   IN .
2. On the other hand, it is also possible to represent the set up with the information concerning the jump process totally unknown, i.e., the
mode-independent case. Here, it suffices to
suppose M  1 and i1  1 for i  S.
3. The so-called cluster observations (see (do
Val et al., 2002)) corresponds to the situation
where only part of the jumping process is accessible and further arranged on disjoint sets.
Under the referenced formulation, we define
g  S  D such that g(i)  j for all i  Sj .
The set Sj represents the cluster to which i
belongs, even if the state i itself is unknown.
Then, given the information provided by the
detector, it suffices to consider Di  g(i)
and ig(i)  1, with M  N , so that (t)
would indicate to which cluster (t) belongs.
Definition 3 We say that i, j  S are distinguishable by the detector (3) whenever Di  Dj 
. Otherwise, Di  Dj 6  and they are said to be
indistinguishable by this detector.
The preceding definition allows a partition of
the state space of the Markov jump process S, in
accordance to the zero pattern of the matrix 
defined in (4). More precisely, this can be done
through the set-valued map
i 7 j  S

Di  Dj 6 .

(7)

In general, some of the sets in the image of (7) will
coincide, because M  N by hypothesis. Letting
N () stand for the number of such distinct sets,
we obtain 1  N ()  M  N along with a
partition S1 , . . . , SN () of S
N ()

whenever s 6 .

For later use, we define the set R ,
1, . . . , N (), along with the function   S  R
such that (i)   if and only if i  S .
Remark 2 The sets of distinguishable operating
modes just defined are somewhat related to the
clusters introduced in (do Val et al., 2002). The
main difference between these two approaches is
that, in our case, besides the sets we are endowed
with additional parameters (the matrix ), which
can be taken into account for analysis and synthesis purposes. Informally, the emission probabilities can be seen as relative weights which tell the
controller how to proceed in the scenario of partial
observations.

We introduce the following lemma, which will
allow us to deal with the H control problem that
will be formulated in Section 2.1. This result is a
bounded real lemma (BRL) for continuous-time
MJLS with partial information on the Markovian parameters. (For the proof, see (Graciani
Rodrigues et al., 2015). See also (Todorov and
Fragoso, 2008).)

In this section we discuss the static state feedback
scenario with partial information on the Markov
chain. Concerning this matter, we deal with the
following controlled continuous-time MJLS
(
x(t)  A(t) x(t) + B(t) u(t) + J(t) w(t),
Gu 
z(t)  C(t) x(t) + D(t) u(t) + L(t) w(t),
(10)
with Ai  Rnx nx , Bi  Rnx nu , Ji  Rnx nw ,
Ci  Rnz nx , Di  Rnz nu , Li  Rnz nw , for
i  S. Here, u  u(t) t  R+  is the control
variable in Rnu and we assume that the state x(t)
is completely known while on the other hand there
is only partial information regarding (t).
Our aim is to design a detector-based state
feedback controller of the form
u(t)  K(t) x(t),

particular case of (2) with Ji  Ji and Li  Li .
The design comes in the form of the next theorem,
which is the first main result of the paper.

where t denotes the number of necessary iterates for a particular set of parameters. Bearing
in mind the convergence criterion in step 3, it is
not difficult to see that (t + 1)  0 , so that
the maximum number of iterates cannot be larger
than  (0) .

case of cluster observations (  0.5) is close
(about 77.28, actually) to the worst case scenario of no information on the Markov jump process (traced line), which coincides with (Morais

obtain a whole range of possible scenarios, including the case of complete observation of the jump

Concluding remarks

In this paper we have presented a new approach
to H control for continuous-time Markov jump
linear systems (MJLS), in a scenario of partial observations of the Markov jump process (). The

distinguishing feature of this approach is that, inspired by (Costa et al., 2015 Graciani Rodrigues
et al., 2015), we have assumed that the partial observations are provided by a suitable detector ()
of the Markov chain. The main results (Theorem
2 and Algorithm 3) feature an efficient method,
based on linear matrix inequalities, for designing detector-based H controllers for continuoustime MJLS. Numerical simulations show that,
given a suitable detector along with the parameters in (4), the proposed design can yield much
less conservative results than mode-independent
approach.
