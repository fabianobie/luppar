Abstract This paper presents a method of designing vector fields for controlling a simplified fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) with constraints in the inputs and in the state variables. The aim of the control strategy is to make the UAV
converge to a circle and circulate on it indefinitely. The constraints considered are (i) maximum and minimum limit in the forward
speed command (ii) maximum limit in the absolute value of the yaw rate.
Keywords Motion control, aerial robotics.

Introduction

The problem of controlling robots to converge to
curves (and maybe circulate them) has been recently
addressed by many researchers (Gonçalves, Pimenta,
Maia, Dutra and Pereira, 2010 Pisano et al., 2006
Hsieh et al., 2007 Lawrence et al., 2008 Ceccarelli
et al., 2008 Gonçalves, Pimenta, Maia, Pereira, Dutra,
Michael, Fink and Kumar, 2010 Hsieh et al., 2008
Mellinger and Kumar, 2011). Some applications in
the case of UAVs are surveillance (Hsieh et al., 2008),
terrain coverage (Xu et al., 2011), environmental monitoring (Casbeer et al., 2006), and convoy protection
for unmanned ground vehicles (Ding et al., 2010). In
many of these works, the chosen alternative to deal
with such a problem was a vector field approach. In
this methodology, the basic idea is to set a velocity input or an acceleration input for the robot based on an
artificial vector field.
For instance, a methodology for robot navigation
along time-varying curves in n-dimensional spaces
based on vector fields is proposed in (Gonçalves, Pimenta, Maia, Dutra and Pereira, 2010). If the robot is
holonomic and fully actuated, it is proved that the designed control law makes the robot converge to a target curve and circulate on it indefinitely. The authors
also argue that one advantage of vector field based approaches is their robustness in the presence of localization errors. As in (Hsieh et al., 2007), the designed
vector field is composed of two additive terms, the first
being responsible for the convergence to the curve and
the second one related to the circulation of the curve.
However, no considerations are made about the presence of constraints in the variables of the dynamical
system.
In (Ceccarelli et al., 2008), the problem of

controlling a multi-agent system composed of nonholonomic robots described as kinematic planar unicycles controlled by angular speed commands is addressed. The aim of the strategy is to make the system execute a collective circular motion. The authors
present sufficient conditions for local stability in terms
of the controller parameters, and limitations on the
communication among agents are also taken into account.
One approach for the construction of vector fields
to guide UAVs is presented in (Lawrence et al., 2008),
where the authors propose a methodology that generates globally stable vector fields in 3D. At first a loiter
circle is considered as the target curve and then the
possibility of switching the circular loiter vector field
is considered in such a way that arbitrary way point
paths can be followed. In addition, they propose a
coordinate transformation that preserves the stability
properties of the original vector field and warps the
loiter circle into another shape.
In the present paper, the problem of controlling a
fixed-wing UAV so that it converges to a circle and circulates on it indefinitely is considered. In addition the
influence of constraints in the inputs and in the state
variables is taken into account. Differently from previous works, we design vector fields that obey the constraints in the forward speed and in the yaw rate.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2
the problem to be solved is stated. In Section 3 the
vector field methodology used to solve the stated problem is presented. A numerical experiment is shown
and analysed in Section 4. Finally, in Section 5 the
conclusions and the perspectives for future works are
presented.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

We assume that the UAV is already controlled by an
inner loop controller, so that the resultant dynamical
behaviour of the UAV is given by a reference model
that is much simpler than the UAV original open loop
model. Inspired by (Bayraktar et al., 2004), the reference model can be written as
x

where x, y and z are the Cartesian coordinates of the
center of mass of the UAV,  is the yaw angle, v is the
forward speed, zc is the altitude command, c is the
yaw command, and vc is the forward speed command.

where M , vmin and vmax are positive constants that
represent, respectively, the maximum yaw rate, the

constraint (3), together with vmin  v(0)  vmax , implies vmin  v(t)  vmax , t  0. According to model
(1) and constraints (2), (3), it is evident that (i) the
UAV can never stop (ii) it is a second-order robot

Since the considered problem is the circulation of

Given an UAV modelled by (4), the problem to be
solved can be stated as
Find a control law for which the trajectory of the
UAV converges to a circle and the UAV circulates on
it indefinitely, so that the constraints (2) and (3) are
always satisfied.

METHODOLOGY

We propose a vector-field-based approach to address
the problem of making a UAV track a circle in the
counterclockwise direction in the plane. In this paper we assume that the UAV is flying with a constant
altitude, i.e.,
zc (t)  z(t)  c, t  0.

(16)

(17)

According to Figure 3, the vector field with such
structure will cause the UAV to move predominantly
in the radial direction when it is far from the target
circle. As it gets closer to the circle, the magnitude
of the tangential component becomes greater than the
radial component counterpart so as to fulfill the task
of circulating the target circle.

(9)

A possible structure for an artificial vector field is
 ()    +  


f () + g() ,

(10)

where  is the unit vector in the radial direction and 
is the unit vector in the tangential direction. Note that
 in (10) is different from  in (4), since the vector
field and the UAV model are independent. Consider a
positive definite function

whose time derivative is given by
W ()  (  R)
 (  R) f ().

In order to have the set of points satisfying   R
(a circle) as an invariant set for the trajectories induced
by the vector field, one should design f () and g()
in (10) such that g(R)R 6 0, and W () < 0, according
to Lyapunovs direct method (Slotine and Li, 1991).
In this case it is sufficient to have

 f ()  0, for   R,
f () > 0, for  < R,
(13)

f () < 0, for  > R.

The function f (.) should also be upper and lower
bounded due to the existence of maximum and minimum limits for radial velocity. A function that is well
suited is the hyperbolic tangent function

where K f > 0 and R > 0 are design parameters of the
vector field, and vd denotes the desired forward speed
and obeys the inequality vmin < vd < vmax .
Assuming that the desired forward speed vd of the
UAV is constant, the vector field must be normalized
according to the expression

where min is the minimum radius reached by the UAV
along the trajectory (which can be R, in principle, assuming the robot starts out of the target circle and
never gets into it when submitted to the control law in

to e (0) due to the exponential decay of e ) and, from
(19),

To avoid a very large settling time, we define a

(22)
where  e is a small constant value chosen to avoid
K (e (t))   as e (t)  0. The proof of convergence of the error dynamics e  K (e )e for the
controller defined by (22) is based on the definition
of a positive definite function F(e )  21 e2 , such that
F(e )  e e  K (e )e2 . Since K (e ) > 0, e ,
then F(e ) < 0, e 6 0, and the global asymptotic
stability of the error dynamics is guaranteed (Slotine
and Li, 1991). Moreover, since the sign of e is always
the opposite of the sign of e , e  is monotonically
decreasing, and K (e ) necessarily increases monotonically over time until it reaches the maximum value

Notice that e  decreases linearly when t < t  and decreases exponentially when t  t  , therefore convergence is proved.

Therefore expression (26) can be used to design
the vector field  (). Once the value of K f is set, the
controller gain K is given directly by (22). Notice,
however, that it was implicitly assumed that (t)

the circle and the UAV never gets into the circle.

Theorem 1 (Tracking) The UAV with dynamic behavior described by the set of equations (4), when subjected to the control law given by (6), (9), and (17),
with the vector field described by (10)-(16), such that
min
0 < K f < RR
R Rmin , will converge asymptotically to a circular path of radius R > Rmin in the counterclockwise
direction around the origin in the plane xy, without
violating the constraints given by (3) and (8), if the
trajectory starts in the set  given by

e (0)  0,




(0)  R,

r ((0)) + e (0)  2 ,

Proof When choosing a value of K f such that 0 <
min
K f < RR
R Rmin , and a value of R such that R > Rmin ,
and the controller gain K as given by (21) or (22),
the constraint in the yaw rate given in (8) will be always satisfied as long as (t)  min  R, t  0. This
means that any possible prohibited regions (i.e., regions where the constraint given by (8) is violated
when the control law (6) is active) that may exist will
be such that  < R. Therefore we need to show that
the UAV will never enter the region defined by  < R
when control law (6) is active.
The set  of initial conditions defined by the relations e (0)  0, (0)  R and e (0) + r ((0)) 

2 (ignoring variables , z and v) correspond to the
shaded region shown in Figure 5. The curves in
blue and magenta correspond to the sets e  0 and
e + r ()  2 , respectively, and are the boundaries
of the set . To demonstrate that the prohibited region
contained in the set  < R will never be visited by the
UAV when control law (6) is active, it is sufficient to
prove that  is an invariant set. In other words, one
must show that the vector x  e T at the boundaries of the region  does not point outward , i.e.,
xT n > 0, where n is the vector normal to the boundary
of the region  that points inward.
Starting from e + r ()  2 (magenta boundary in Figure 5), we have the normal vector n 
1 r T . Thus, from (7), and the fact that we are
on the boundary,

the trajectory in 1 (inside the circle with radius R),

Since K > 0 and e > 0 on the boundary e +

Therefore xT n  e  K e  0.
To prove convergence to the circle one has to
show that  < 0 for  6 R and   0 for   R in
. Considering the UAV in  and excluding the magenta boundary which is repulsive, according to (27),
we have that 0 < e + r () < 2 and 0 < cos(e +
r ()) < 1. If  > R, then   vcos(e + r ()) <
0, i.e.,  is monotonically decreasing. If   R (and
therefore e  0), then (e , )  (0, 0). Thus, the
equilibrium point (e , )  (0, R) is an attractor in ,
and defines the circular path of radius R in the counterclockwise direction (according to the definition of
g() in (16)) around the origin in xy plane.

will make the UAV converge to  without violating

Proof First notice that constraints (3) and (8) are automatically satisfied when defining the control inputs

substituting (28) in (5).

which means that the UAV performs a turn in the counterclockwise direction, since   M . Considering
that 2 <  < 3
2 in 2 , from (4) we can conclude that
 > 0, i.e., once the UAV is in 2 it will never go into
1 . According to (29), the inequality   vmax

true. So if we choose R such that M > vmax

requirement already considered in (25) and (26)), we
have that   vmax
R  M < 0. Therefore,  will cross
the value 2 rad and the UAV will enter .
In 3 ,  also behaves according to (29). Since

more, according to (4) we have that   0. So there
are two possible behaviors (i)  becomes smaller than
3
2 before  becomes smaller than R and the UAV enters 2  or (ii)  becomes smaller than R before 
becomes smaller than 3
2 and the UAV enters 1 .
Considering the UAV in 4 we have that

From (4) and (28),   M , and the UAV performs
a turn in the clockwise direction. Since 0 <  <
r () < 2 in 4 and  dynamics is given by (30), we
conclude that  > 0 in 4 . Furthermore, according
to (4),  < 0. So, similarly to 3 , there are two possible behaviours (i)  reaches 2 before  becomes
smaller than R and the UAV enters  or (ii)  becomes smaller than R before  reaches 2 and the UAV
enters 1 .
A schematic summary of the above discussion is
presented in Figure 6. It reveals that the UAV will get
into  sooner or later, regardless of starting in 1 , 2 ,
3 or 4 ,
2
In summary, if the UAV starts in an arbitrary but
valid initial condition outside , the control law proposed in Theorem 2 makes the UAV converge to ,
and the control law proposed in Theorem 1 guarantees
convergence of the UAV trajectory to the desired circular motion.
Corollary 1 From TheoremsS
1 and 2,and considering
that the state space of (4) is 4i1 i  , the control
law given by (6), (9), (17), and (28) will asymptotically guide the UAV to the circle for all possible initial
conditions.

Conclusions

In this paper a vector field based methodology for
controlling a fixed-wing UAV modelled as a nonholonomic robot with maximum and minimum forward
speed command and bounded yaw rate was given. The
aim of the strategy was to make the UAV converge to a
circle and circulate on it indefinitely. This is in fact an
important task since it could be used in applications
such as surveillance. One simulation was presented
to illustrate that the proposed methodology fulfils the
control objective without violating the yaw rate constraint and the forward speed command constraints.
The UAV converged to the target curve and the constraints were satisfied all the time.

Future Work

One perspective for future work is to extend the results presented in this paper to control multiple UAVs
with the objective of target encirclement (Franchi
et al., 2010). To circumvent the problem of collision
the vector field approach derived in our group could
be adapted and applied (Gonçalves et al., 2011).
Another perspective is to extend the proposed
methodology to consider other kinds of closed curves
different from the circle.
It is also our intention to implement the proposed strategy in our fixed-wing platform (Iscold
et al., 2010).
