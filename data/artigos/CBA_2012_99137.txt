Abstract - In this work are used two different methods for control allocation, namely daisy chain and optimal control, for aircraft fault tolerant control. The control system is based on the blending of dynamic inversion and control allocation. In both implementations the control allocation is used to compute control surface deflections to produce certain desired aerodynamic moments in roll, pitch and yaw. In daisy chain there is no need to redesign the controller when such faults occur while using an optimal control allocation would be necessary to employ a fault detection and identification (FDI) algorithm. Hence a fully coupled
6 degree of freedom (DOF) model is employed to demonstrate an application on damaged aircraft and the controller was used to
compensate variations due to control surface degradation.
Keywords - Fault tolerant, flight control, dynamic inversion, control allocation.
Resumo - Neste trabalho são utilizados dois algoritmos de alocação_de_controle, daisy chain e alocação_ótima de controle, para
implementar controle_tolerante_a_falhas de aeronaves. O sistema_de_controle é baseado no uso conjunto de inversão_dinâmica e
alocação_de_controle. Em ambas implementações investigadas a alocação_de_controle é usada para calcular os desvios necessários das superfícies de controle, a fim de produzir determinados momentos aerodinâmicos nos eixos de arfagem, rolamento e
guinada. Usando-se o método daisy chain não há necessidade de se reestruturar o controlador quando uma falha ocorrer, enquanto que o emprego do método de alocação_ótima de controle demanda o uso de um algoritmo de detecção_de_falha e identificação. Um modelo totalmente acoplado com 6 graus de liberdade é empregado para ilustrar uma aplicação em uma aeronave danificada e o controlador foi usado para compensar as variações devido ao controle degradado da superfície.

1 Introduction
Flight control under failure or damaged aircraft
in off-nominal flight conditions pose significant technical challenges in many areas due to the dramatically change that could happen in control derivatives.
According to Bodson (1993) a fault tolerant flight
control, must deal with challenges such as 1) an aircraft is intrinsically a nonlinear system with changes
in parameters with operating conditions 2) an aircraft
may become highly unstable after occurrence of a
failure 3) a strong cross-couplings, especially after an
asymmetric failure, making it a multivariable control
problem.
In order deal with these challenges, one solution presented by Abdallah (2011) is a synthesis between
dynamic inversion, see Hemerly, et al (2007) and
Slotine and Li (1991) and control allocation techniques to reconfigure part of the faulty control surface. The fault tolerant control system is composed of
several key components. The core control is performed by a nonlinear dynamic inversion controller
that generates a virtual control command in term of
moment demands for roll, pitch and yaw torques, and
control allocation to make the combinations of con-

trol surface deflections that meet this given set of
moment demands. Several control allocation (CA)
methods have been described in the literature
(Hrkegrd 2003, Durham 1993 and Wise et al.
1999) direct control allocation, optimal control allocation, daisy chain and the linear programming
method.
In this work are used two different methods for control allocation, daisy chain and optimal control allocation. In both CA strategies, the control is distributed based on the efficiency of the actuators, and
redistributed to the remaining healthy actuators
when faultsfailures occur. It is shown that both methods are capable of retiming the aircraft and when
hardover failure is applied to one aileron. Furthermore the aircraft remains controllable with little performance degradation in pilot commands. The difference between the methods is the implementation. The
daisy chain is simpler than the optimal control allocation and its remains the same without any
reconfiguration after the failure. However the optimal
control allocation needs a fault detection and identification system.
Burken, et al (2006) use the same strategies of dynamic inversion (DI) control plus the CA daisy chain.
However, they use a simplified DI in the roll and
pitch axes and a classical control law for yaw axis. In

this work is used a full nonlinear 6 degree of freedom
model to do the DI.
The contributions of this work can be summarized as

A full 6 DOF model without simplifications is used in the design of nonlinear dynamic inversion, for more realistically
evaluating the control allocation strategies.

It is shown that daisy chain for control allocation is simpler than the optimal control
based strategy, and exhibits the similar
performance. In particular, it sidesteps the
necessity of using a FDI algorithm, whose
design is typically costly.
This paper is organized as follow in section 2 the DI
control strategy is summarized. The control allocation strategies are described in section 3. Simulations
results are presented in section 4, followed by the
conclusions in section 5.
2 DYNAMIC INVERSION CONTROLLER
This section presents a summary of dynamic inversion, which is a form of feedback linearization,
see Hemerly, et al (2007) and Slotine and Li (1991)
for details, it assumes that the exact form of a dynamic equations system is known and all states can
be measured. A controller can be formulated to make
the input-output behavior of the system as a set of
integrators.
The DI flight control strategy was designed by considering two sets of equations. The first one composes the inner loop and deals directly with the aircraft angular rates. The second one is an outer loop
linking the sideslip angle with the yaw angular rate.
The basic diagram is shown in Fig. 1.
All dynamic inversions were performed by supposing a standard x-y-z flat earth, rigid body and symmetrical airplane six-degree-of-freedom dynamic
model. The six-degree-of-freedom aircraft dynamics
can be expressed as, (Steven and Lewis, 2003)

The aerodynamics coefficients, and consequently the
aerodynamic forces and moments, are function of the
states of the vehicle and also function of the aerodynamic control surface deflections. For the flight controls problem in this work, three aerodynamic control
surfaces are assumed the aileron,  a , for lateral control the rudder,  r , for directional control and the
elevator,  e , for longitudinal control, composing the
input vector u    a  r  e  T . These control surfaces are directly used in the inner linearization loop
to control the output variables, assumed to be
y   p q r T .

Therefore, from equation (1) the inner linearization
loop becomes linear in aerodynamic derivatives 1
and  2 as

The last 2 terms in (3) are the contributions of the
aerodynamics characteristics of the aircraft, including
the aerodynamic control surfaces. These portions
depend on the modeling of C L , C D and CY and

C l , C m and C n as a function of the aircraft model
states and inputs. They are omitted here, since they
are quite large expressions.
3 CONTROL ALLOCATION
In flight control system usually surface deflections are done for decoupling the axes. However,
when the aircraft experiences actuator failure or airframe damage, the aircraft becomes asymmetric.
Hence the actuator system must control the actuators
fully independent, which means that ailerons (or elevators) can individually move up, down, or together
in the same direction. The propose of control allocation is to take advantage of aircraft over-actuated
systems, by computing control surface deflections
fully independently in order to produce certain desired aerodynamic moments in roll, pitch, and yaw
axes. This configuration permits some pitch torque to
be produced with ailerons or some roll torque to be
produced with elevators.
3.1 Implementation Issues

Two approaches employed here for control allocation are daisy chain and optimal control. Both control allocation methods use as inputs the desired
aerodynamic moments and actual aerodynamic moments. However the dynamic inversion proposed in
section 2 has aerodynamic control surface deflections
u    a  r  e cmd T as output. Besides sensors in the
aircraft only measure the surface deflections position.
One way to have the desired aerodynamic moments
would be to modify the dynamic inversion implementation to give these outputs. In this work the desired
aerodynamic moments was calculated by using the
desired aerodynamic control surface deflections and
the aerodynamic surface coefficients C l , C m and

Figure 2. Implementation details for control allocation.
The actual aerodynamic moments that are been provided by the surfaces, could be also calculated using
the surface position and in the aerodynamic surface
coefficients C l , C m and C n of each individual surface.
3.2. Daisy Chain Method

A daisy chain control allocation technique is used to
ensure that conventional flight control surfaces are
utilized under normal operating conditions. Using
daisy chain, the design of the flight control system
can be separated into the derivation of the control
laws and a control allocator. There is no need to redesign the controller when faults occur, since the
control allocation compensates for the fault, reallocating the demand of desired aerodynamic moment in
other surface, rather than the faulted one.
An advantage of performing control allocation separately, rather than letting the control distribution be
decided by the feedback law, is that actuator position
and rate limits can be considered. If one actuator
saturates, the remaining actuators can be used to
make up the difference (Durham 1993 and Wise et al.
1999).
In daisy chain control allocation (Buffington and
Enns 1996, Bordignon 1996, Durham and Bordignon
1996), the allocator suite is divided into groups
which are successively employed to generate the total
control effort. The control allocation problem can be
stated as solving

B1u1 + B2u 2 + K + BM u M  v

(5)

where matrix B i is the control effectiveness matrix
of the control effectors in relation of the control variable v . The daisy chain control allocation procedure can be summarized as (Hrkegrd 2003)

k i ( t )  0 the i th actuator is working perfectly whereas
if ki ( t ) > 0 , a fault is present, and if k i ( t )  1 the
actuator has failed completely.
To properly implement the optimal control allocation, it is necessary to compute K(t) in real time. Several methods could be used as described in
Hrkegrd (2005), Bordignon (1995), Boskovic
(2002), Davidson et al (2001). As this work does not
involve fault detection and identification (FDI), the
effectiveness gain K(t) will be assumed as known
after the failure. In the next section it will be introduced a hardover failure in one surface, what implicates in an ki  1 for the failure surface.

3.3. Optimization Based Control Allocation

The fault tolerant controller was simulated with a
high fidelity regional airjet aircraft model. It was
simulated a hardover in left aileron to study the behavior of the controllers under failure conditions (see
figure 3). The effects of the aileron hardover induce a
change in the roll moment coefficients as well as
change in the lift coefficient. The consequence of this
is that the aircraft would exhibit a pitch-roll coupling
when the ailerons are deflected asymmetrically.

For optimization based control allocation is assumed that the system subject to actuator faults or
failures can be written as

As this work does not involve fault detection or
identification (FDI), for the simulation of the optimal
control allocation it was used two gains one considering a fault free situation, WI, and one considering
W with the left aileron hardover. The gain of optimal
control was switched when the failure was introduced. The use of fault detection and identification
(FDI) is a disadvantage for the optimal control allocation, since it is more complex than the daisy chain.
The stability of the aircraft can be regained if sufficient control powers are still available to overcome
the rolling and yawing moments as well as to retrim
the aircraft in the pitch axis. The results for both allocation methods are shown in figure 4, 5 and 6.

To maintain a trim state, the flight control must compensate for the unwanted roll motion. It is possible
to see that both control allocation provide good compensation for the unwanted roll and yaw motion commanding the remain aileron and rudder, however the
daisy chain exhibits some advantages during pilot
command in yaw axis, since it causes smaller deviations in other axes. (see figure 6).

ISBN 978-85-8001-069-5

By using the control allocation together with dynamic
inversion, it is possible to obtain the desired performance by commanding the elevator asymmetrically
(see figure 3). Thus, the deflection of the elevator
would result in a pitch-yaw coupling that must be
compensated within the flight control system by adjusting the rudder control accordingly. Because of the
asymmetry, the general motion of the aircraft is coupled in all the three axes.
5. CONCLUSION

This paper investigated the application of the
dynamic inversion with control allocation strategy for
aircraft flight control systems in failure condition.
Two different the control allocation methods were
used. From the simulations, the following conclusion
can be drawn if there is performance degradation
due to a failure, such as hardover in one of command
surface, both control allocation methods associated
with the dynamic inversion controller has enough

robustness to retrim the aircraft. However, the daisy
chain is much simpler than the optimal control allocation. In daisy chain methods there is no need to redesign the controller when such faults occur, while the
use of optimal control allocation would require a
fault detection and identification (FDI) algorithm to
estimate the effectiveness gain K(t) and recalculated
the control allocation gain.
