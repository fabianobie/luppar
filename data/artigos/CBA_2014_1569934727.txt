Abstract This work addresses the problem of local stabilization of open-loop unstable continuous-time
quadratic systems subject to actuator saturation by means of a nonlinear state feedback control law. Statedependent LMI conditions are obtained to provide a nonlinear control law locally with the aim of stabilize the
closed-loop system while providing an enlarged estimate of the system region of attraction. Control saturation
effects are taken into account by the application of a generalized sector bound condition. A numerical example
is presented in order to illustrate the potentials of the proposed design method.

. In particular, the DAR
has been successfully applied to local stability assessement and performance analysis problems for
the classes of rational and polynomial nonlinear
systems. see, e.g., (Coutinho, Bazanella, Trofino
and Silva, 2004 Coutinho, Fu and Trofino, 2004
Coutinho, Pagano and Trofino, 2004 Coutinho
and Gomes da Silva Jr., 2010). However, the control synthesis considering DAR leads in general to
a nonconvex problem. To overcome this problem
relaxed design conditions may be considered, but
they might lead to potentially conservative results
(Coutinho et al., 2008).

Introduction

The field of nonlinear control systems has been
the subject of intensive research over the last
decades, which has led to a wide range of papers as well as text books (Khalil, 1996). Contrasting with linear control systems, the derivation
of analytical solutions to nonlinear control problems are constrained to very few cases and thus
numerical procedures are often the best solution.
Recently, several authors have applied the LMI
framework to derive numerical and tractable conditions to deal with nonlinear control problems (El
Ghaoui and Scorletti, 1996 Chesi, 2011 Coutinho
et al., 2008). In this context, the so-called DAR
(Differential Algebraic Representation) is a nonlinear decomposition in the state-space framework
whose main idea is to define an auxiliary vector containing the higher order terms in order to
obtain LMI based conditions for nonlinear control problems (Coutinho, Bazanella, Trofino and
Silva, 2004). More precisely, Lyapunov stability
conditions are cast in terms of state-dependent
LMI constraints which are required to be satisfied
at a finite set of points, namely the vertices a poly-

On the other hand, approximate models
around operation points based on the Taylor expansion have been historically applied to the control synthesis of nonlinear_systems to avoid very
complex design conditions. However, the Taylor expansion is usually truncated to the firstorder terms, i.e., a linear approximation, which
generally implies that the design conditions hold
within a small vicinity of the operation point. A
more accurate model approximation is to consider additional terms in the Taylor expansion
as, for instance, the class of quadratic systems

block matrix, the symbol  stands for the transpose of the blocks outside the main diagonal block.

(i.e., quadratic nonlinearities in the state variables and bilinear terms in the state and control
signal). It should also be pointed out that nonlinear quadratic models can precisely represent a
large class of systems such as distillation columns,
bioinformatics processes, induction motors, heating and air conditioning systems, and DC-DC converters (Espai and Landau, 1978 Figalli et al.,
1984 Arg, 1999 Fuad et al., 2004 Thounthong
and Pierfederici, 2010 Kulkarni et al., 2010).
From these facts, a wide diversity of convex control design results for quadratic systems has been
recently proposed in the specialized literature due
to a smaller model complexity. For instance, Amato et al. (2010) have proposed sufficient conditions for finite-time stabilization of quadratic systems considering a linear controller, Coutinho and
de Souza (2012) have addressed the design of nonlinear quadratic state feedback controllers with a
guaranteed stability_region for quadratic systems,
and Valmorbida et al. (2010) have studied the
state feedback design for a class of quadratic systems (precisely, quadratic in the state with a linear
control input) subject to actuator saturation.
This paper proposes LMI-based conditions to
the local stabilization of fully quadratic systems
(i.e., quadratic in the state and bilinear with respect to state and input) subject to actuator saturation. To this end, the saturation nonlinearity
is taken into account by applying a generalized
sector bound condition. Then, a nonlinear decomposition and a similarity transformation are
considered to obtain affine state-dependent matrix
inequalities which ensure the local stability of the
closed-loop system with a guaranteed stability_region. In addition, a convex optimization problem
subject to a finite set of LMIs is proposed to maximize the size of the stability_region, which can be
seen as an estimate of the domain of attraction of
the origin.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 states the problem of interest. Some preliminary results are given in Section 3. The main
result of the paper is proposed in Section 4, precisely, a theorem is presented to compute a nonlinear quadratic state feedback controller which
guarantees local exponential stability of the zero
equilibrium point of the closed-loop system and
a convex optimization procedure is proposed to
derive a maximized estimate of the domain of attraction. A numerical example is given to illustrate the application of the proposed methodology in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 presents some
concluding remarks.

Problem Statement

Consider the following quadratic system
x  A(x)x + B(x) sat(u), x(0)  x0

(1)

where x  X  Rn is the state vector, u  Rnu
is the control input, X is some polytopic region
of state-space containing the system origin, and
A  X 7 Rnn and B  X 7 Rnnu are affine
matrix functions of x, namely
A(x)  A0 +

n

xi Bi , (2)

i1

with xi denoting the ith component of x, and Ai
and Bi , for i  0, 1, ..., n, being real constant matrices with appropriate dimensions. It is assumed
that the pair (A0 , B0 ) is controllable. In addition, the equilibrium point x  0 of the unforced
system (1) with u(t)  0 is allowed to be unstable. The operator sat() is the classical saturation
function, which is defined as follows



sat u(i) (t)  sign u(i) (t) min u(i) (t) ,
u0(i) , i  1, ..., nu

(3)

with u(i) (t) being the ith component of u(t) and
u0(i) > 0, i  1, ..., nu denoting the symmetric
saturation level of the ith actuator.
This paper aims at designing a nonlinear state
feedback control law of the following form
u  K(x)x, K(x)  K1 (x) + K2 (x),

(4)

where K1 (x) is an affine matrix function of x, i.e.
K1 (x)  K0 +

n
X

xi Ki , Ki  Rnu n ,

i1

where Ki , i  0, 1, ..., n, are constant matrices
and K2 (x) is a quadratic matrix function of x to
be specified later in this paper. Then, the closedloop system of (1) with (4) reads
x  A(x)x + B(x) sat(K(x)x) .

(5)

Assuming that K(x) ensures the local asymptotic stability of the equilibrium point x  0 of
system (5), we define the region (or domain) of

3159

attraction, denoted as RA , as the set of initial
conditions for which the trajectories of (5) converge to the origin, i.e
n

In addition, consider the following representation of the matrix B(x)

A common situation is to determine the gain
K(x) in order to enlarge the system region of attraction. However, the solution to this problem is
in general not possible, as the gain computation is
strongly connected with the shape and size of the
region. Alternatively, we can approximately address this problem by maximizing an estimate of
the region of attraction. Suitable estimates can be
obtained by means of Lyapunov domains, which
are based on the Lyapunov theory as summarized
in the following lemma (Khalil, 1996 Chesi, 2011).

and the normalized Lyapunov domain as follows
D , x  Rn  x P x  1 .

Preliminaries

Notice that the region D as above defined is an
ellipsoidal set.
Taking (11), (12) and (17) into account, the
time-derivative of V (x) along the trajectory of system (11) is given by1 

Saturation handling

Firstly, define a decentralized deadzone nonlinearity
 (K(x)x) , K(x)x  sat (K(x)x)

xi Gi , Gi  Rnu n ,

with Gi , i  0, 1, ..., n, being constant matrices
and G2 (x) is a quadratic matrix function of x.
In the following, we state a generalized sector
condition (Coutinho and Gomes da Silva Jr., 2010
Tarbouriech et al., 2011) to deal with the deadzone
nonlinearity. To this end, let the following set

In view of the latter lemma, the set D(c) is a
region of guaranteed asymptotic stability (RAS)
of the origin. In other words, D(c) is contained in
the region of attraction of the origin of the nonlinear system and thus it is an estimate of it.
Hence, the problem of concern in this paper
can be summarized as follows
Problem 1 For the closed-loop system in (5),
determine the gain K(x) and a Lyapunov function
V (x) such that the estimate of the system region of
attraction D(c), satisfying Lemma 1, is maximized
considering some size criterion.

for some scalar c > 0.Then, the equilibrium point
x  0 is locally exponentially stable and V (x) is a
Lyapunov function in X . Moreover, the set D(c)
is a contractive positively invariant set, i.e., for
any x0  D(c), x(t)  D(c), t  0, and x(t)
approaches the origin as t  .

In view of Lemma 2 and the above, it follows
that V < 0,  x  S, x 6 0, if the following holds

It should be noted that the auxiliary vector

then (20) holds for all x 6 0 and thus we have
V < 0 for all nonzero x  S.

where L  Rn(n+1)n is a scaling matrix to be

However, condition (34) tends to be conservative because the state x links (x) and s

The region of admissible states X




In order to apply Lemma 1, the condition V (x) <
0 has to be satisfied for all nonzero x  X . Thus,
provided that D  X is satisfied, it follows that
D  RA . In other words, the set D is a RAS for
the system in (5).
Since D is an ellipsoid, we consider X to be
a symmetric (with respect to the origin) convex
polyhedral set as defined below
X , x  Rn  hi x  1, i  0, . . . , nf 

i  1, . . . , nu , j  1, . . . ,  . (42)

Then, the control law u  sat(K(x)x), with
K(x)  F(x)Q1 , where F(x) is as in (23) and
(24), ensures that the equilibrium point x  0 of
the closed-loop system (5) is locally exponentially
stable and V (x)  x Q1 x is a Lyapunov function
in X . Moreover, the set D as defined in (18) is
a RAS for the closed-loop system, that is, for any
x0  D, the trajectory x(t)  D, for all t  0, and
limt x(t)  0.

(37)

where hi  Rn , i  1, . . . nf , are constant vectors
defining the 2nf faces of X . In this case, the inclusion D  X holds provided that the following matrix inequalities are satisfied (Boyd et al., 1994)
1  hi P 1 hi  0, i  1, . . . , nf .

(38)

Alternatively, the polyhedral set X can be described in terms of the convex hull of its vertices
with are denoted by vj  Rn , j  1, ..., , i.e.
X  Cov1 , v2 , ..., v .

Proof Firstly, note that the LMIs in (40) ensure
the non-singularity of Q and that D  X .
Suppose the conditions in (41) and (42) are
satisfied. Then, by convexity they are satisfied for
all x  X , i.e. with vj  x, x  X .
Let V (x)  x P x with P  Q1 . Hence, we
have

(39)

This means that any x  X can be written as a
convex combination of the vertices vj , that is

where 1 and 2 are the smallest and largest eigenvalues of P , respectively.
Next, consider the set of LMIs in (41). Then,
it follows that

In the following, we show that the stabilization conditions can be cast in terms of affine state
dependent LMI constraints. Hence, by the virtue
of representation (39), using convexity arguments
it follows that the stability of the closed-loop system can be ensured via the feasibility of a set of
state-dependent LMIs at the vertices of X .

Hence, from Lemmas 1 and 2, we can conclude
that D is a RAS for system (5) provided that D

Now, we show in the following that (42) implies D  S. To this end, applying the Schurs
complement to (42), and then pre- and postmultiplying the resulting inequality by    and

Coutinho and de Souza (2012) disregarding the

where x  

since b   0 by construction. In light of (21),
(23) and (25), the above inequality leads to

for all x  D. In other words, we have that

x  D and thus D  S, which completes the
proof.

Note that the minimization of Trace(W ) implies the minimization of Trace(P ) which approximately maximizes the sum of the squared semiaxes lengths of the ellipsoid D. There exist other
cost functions which can be applied to maximize
the size of D such as the volume maximization,
minor axis maximization and the maximization in
certain direction. A detailed discussion on this
issue can be found in Chapter 2 of Tarbouriech
et al. (2011) and references therein. It should be
noticed that (40), (41), (42) and (46) are LMIs
and thus (47) is a convex problem.

a linear state feedback, the estimate obtained with
the proposed approach considering F1  0, F2  0
and F  0, i.e., a linear state feedback, is also depicted in Fig. 3. It is clear in this case the significant conservatism reduction when the approach
specifically devised for quadratic systems is considered.

the time response of the state trajectory and of

that, although the actuator starts saturated, the
convergence of the states to the origin is indeed
achieved.

This paper has presented an LMI-based approach
to design a static nonlinear quadratic state feedback to locally stabilize quadratic systems subject
to saturating actuators. Precisely, Lyapunov stability conditions are translated in the LMI framework by means of a nonlinear decomposition together with a generalized sector bound condition
to deal with the saturation effects. In addition, a
convex optimization is proposed to obtain a maximized estimate of the system region of attraction.
A numerical example shows the effectiveness of
the proposed method. Future research is concentrated in extending the approach to deal with performance issues.
