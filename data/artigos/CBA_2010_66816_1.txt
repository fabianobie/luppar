Abstract
 This paper presents a new system to get the angular position from a resolver position sensor. Its outputs are demodulated through a real time linear regression by using recursive least square (RLS), making possible the estimation of values
proportional to the sine and the cosine of the angular position. With that information, the angular position is calculated by inverse trigonometric functions. Simulation results show the high precision and robustness of the proposed algorithm.
Keywords

To evaluate the performance of a RDC substitute, the
error for a constant reference, robustness against
noise and the dynamic response when the shaft angle
is not constant (tracking) must be considered.
This paper proposes a software-based algorithm
which uses a recursive least square (RLS) algorithm
to demodulate the signals of the sensor. This technique estimates values proportional to the sine and
cosine of the angular position. They are used to calculate the angular position through inverse trigonometric function. The dynamic behavior and the robustness against noise depend on the parameters of
RLS.
Simulation results where the proposed algorithm is
compared with the proposal explained in (Kaewjinda
and Konghirun, 2006) shows that the use of RLS to
estimate the angular position gives high precision and
robustness against noise.

Introdução

Resolver sensor is an angular position transducer
coupled to the rotor of a electric machines and widely
used in position and speed closed loop control applications (SEW Eurodrive, 1999). This sensor is used
for high precision applications as robotics, CNC machines and semiconductor production machines (Lee
et. al., 1992 Staebler, 2000). It has many advantages
respect to encoders more robustness, higher precision, long operational lifetime, ability to work at
higher angular speed and better noise immunity
(Kaewjinda and Konghirun, 2006).
The resolver sensor is coupled mechanically to the
shaft of the motor. To estimate the angular position
of the rotor from its signal outputs, generally is used
an equipment called resolver-to-digital converter
(RDC). However, it has high cost and its dynamic
response depends on discrete components as resistors
and capacitors, whose values can change during the
lifetime of the sensor (Di Tomasso and Miceli,
2003). For these reasons, many researches were made
in order to develop substitutes to RDC implemented
in software or hardware, with high precision and low
cost (Hanselman, 1990 Yim et al., 1992 Benammar
et al., 2005).
Proposed alternatives reported in literature are based
principally on feedback control loops. Their objective is the reduction of the error between the real and
the estimated angle. Other systems find the tangent of
the shaft angle demodulating the output signals of the
resolver sensor.

2 Modelling of Resolver Sensor
The structure of the resolver sensor is presented
in Fig. 1. It is composed by a rotor winding which is
excited by a sinusoidal voltage with a frequency between 1 kHz to 10 kHz, supplied externally by a
transformer coupling. This excitation induces voltages in two stator windings mechanically displaced
90 between them, as indicated in (1), (2) and (3)

Equation (8) represents a linear system. If matrix W
is founded solving (8), the terms rsin() and rcos()
are obtained. This procedure is equivalent to a demodulation process. The shaft angle can be calculated through the relationship between those terms

The angular position  is founded applying inverse

the function atan2(x, y) (Matsumoto, 2008), which
exists in many simulation programs and DSP programming language This function estimates the angle
between the x-axis and the point (x, y), from  to ,
as indicated in Fig. 2.

The recursive least square (RLS) estimates the
regression vector between the input and the output of
a linear system. This estimation is updated at the
same time new data is presented, making use of the
previous estimations (Tian et al., 2001 Sadoghi et
al., 2009).

However, calculate the inverse of Rxx(n) every instant
of time would demand many mathematical operations
and processing time. To solve that problem, the inverse matrix is founded by a recursive process, using
new data and previous estimations. In first place,
Rxx(n) and Pxy(n) are updated every time new data
appears

The forgetting factor  reduces the effect of old data
in new estimations. It generally takes values from 0

The simulation diagrams of the proposed algorithm,
the reference algorithm based on (Kaewjinda and
Konghirun, 2006) and the simulation scheme were
developed in MATLAB-SIMULINK, as shown in Fig.
3, 4 and 5, respectively. The reference algorithm is
based on a feedback loop that uses a PID controller
to estimate the mechanical speed. The parameters of
the resolver sensor and the two demodulation techniques are shown in Table 1.
Four simulation tests were made in order to evaluate
the performance of these algorithms

The linear references are constant and ramp functions

sinusoidal reference has a magnitude of 2 rad and a

Table 2 shows the mean quadratic error of the two
algorithms for all tests. The results of test 1 and 2
indicate that the proposed algorithm has better precision respect to the reference algorithm, even when
the angle is not constant. That means the proposed
estimation of the angular position based on RLS is
suitable for tracking problems. On the other hand,
test 3 and 4 show that the proposed method has better
robustness against noise.

The proposed algorithm to estimate the angular
position using a resolver sensor has high precision
and robustness against noise. It can be applied in
position and speed control applications. The noise
effect can be reduced even more using a low-pass
filter or modifying the forgetting factor of the RLS
regression. The values of the forgetting factor  and
the initial value of the weighted autocorrelation matrix T(0) were chosen by a try-and-error process. A
future work consists in the development of rules to
select these parameters appropriately.
