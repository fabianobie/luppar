Abstract This paper presents the modeling and control of a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to execute
tasks of load transportation along a desired trajectory. The system modeling is performed via Euler-Lagrange
formulation considering both dynamics of the UAV in Tiltrotor configuration and of the carried load. In order to
design linear control laws, the equations of motion of the rotorcraft are linearized around an equilibrium point of
the UAV. Moreover, to obtain null steady state tracking error, the integral of the controlled position error is also
considered. Two control laws were tuned one based on D-stability and another obtained through minimization
of the H norm. Simulation results are presented corroborating the effectiveness of the control system even in
presence of external disturbances, modeling errors and parametric uncertainties.

. In order to satisfy that, it
is necessary that UAVs are more compact for a
given load. Thus, developing a UAV with an alternative concept combining the ability of vertical
take-offlanding, cruising flight at high speed with
high maneuverability and less energy consumption
results in aircrafts with a Tiltrotor configuration.
From control systems perspective, the construction of this kind of miniature UAV is far from
simplifying the problem. The torques and forces
necessary to control the system are applied not
only by aerodynamic effects, but also through the
coupling effect that occurs between the dynamics
of the rotors and the aircrafts body. This fact,
together with the uncertainties of the model, especially in high frequency bands, makes this system even more complex to be controlled than a
standard helicopter, at least when using classic
control techniques. Studies found in the literature
that implement the concept of Tiltrotor to develop

Introduction

Aerial transport of payloads by towed cables
ranges from emergency rescue missions, where individuals are lifted from dangerous situations, to
the delivery of heavy equipment to the top of a tall
building. Typically, aerial towing is accomplished
via a single cable attached to a payload, which
limits the controllability of the payload. Multirotors UAVs are proper vehicles for autonomous
cargo delivery, since it provides high manoeuvrability, vertical take-off and landing, single-point
hover, and ability to carry loads near to their body
weight, both onboard as suspended by cables.
Control designs for the suspended load transportation using single and multiple micro rotorcrafts
were presented in (Maza et al., 2010 Palunko
et al., 2012 Sreenath et al., 2013).
One of the main challenges in the design of
controllers for this kind of system is due to the underactuation in the task, which requires a stable
movement of the load without destabilize the system. Moreover, this is increased when performed
by multi-rotors UAVs linked to it, since most of
the unmanned aerial vehicles are already underactuated systems due to electromechanical design.

UAVs are presented in (Sanchez et al., 2008 Amiri
et al., 2011 Papachristos et al., 2011).
In this paper it is presented the modeling
of a Tiltrotor with suspended load using EulerLagrange formulation. To perform load transportation through a desired trajectory, two controllers are synthesized based on the linearized
model the first one is based on pole allocation
in desired regions of the complex plan (D-stability
pole allocation (Chilali et al., 1999)) and the second one optimizes the first approach by choosing
a solution inside the same region that maximizes
the disturbance rejection of the aircraft (H control design (Dullerud and Paganini, 2000)).
Section 2 presents the nonlinear dynamic
model of the Tiltrotor with suspended load. Section 3 finds the systems equilibrium point, linearizes the model around this point and presents
the design of the aforementioned controllers. Section 4 shows the results obtained when using each
one of the controllers. Finally, Section 5 concludes this paper and provides suggestions of future work.

System Modeling

In this section the equations of motion for the
Tiltrotor UAV with suspended load are derived
using Euler-Lagrange formulation. The whole system is considered as a multibody system composed
of four rigid bodies (see Figure 1) the main body
(carbon-fiber structure, landing gear, battery and
electronic devices) two thrusters groups, one on
each side of the aircraft (servomotors with rotors), interconnected to the main body by a revolute joint and the suspended load attached to the
main body via a rigid string with negligible mass.

The attitude of the rotors (Ci  xCi yCi zCi  ,
for i  2, 3) in relation to the main body is also
described using Euler angles. However, it is assumed that there is no rotation around axis zCi ,
and the rotation around axis xCi is constant and
defined by  for i  2 and  for i  3, where  is
a small angle. The angle of rotation around axis

The rotational torques are obtained by
adding the torque generated by the thrust forces

of the propellers. The dynamic of the rotor is
assumed in steady-state, which leads to the drag

Control Design

In this section two linear controllers are designed
using Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) approach.
The control objective of the proposed control
strategy is to transport a payload using a Tiltrotor
UAV along a predefined trajectory using a single
control law, which is able to stabilize the whole
system, including the load, even when exogenous
disturbances affect the system, and in presence of
unmodeled dynamics and parametric uncertainties.
The first controller is based on regional pole
allocation (D-Stability) a region on the complex plane is defined and the solver finds a statefeedback control law u  Kx such that the poles
in closed-loop are all inside this region.
This first solution can be satisfactory if the
requirement is to stabilize the rotorcraft while following some trajectories. However, it is still possible to optimize the D-Stable solution by finding
some pole allocation inside the chosen region that
also minimizes some given cost function.
Therefore, a second controller is designed such
that it maintains the pole allocation within the
region of the first example but also maximizing
disturbance rejection. The group of controllers
that satisfy the constraint of maximal disturbance
rejection is known as H controllers.
In the following, the linearized state-space
model and synthesis of the controllers are presented.
3.1

B(q)  G(q)  0

Since this system has ten equations and fourteen variables, to avoid infinite solutions, four
variables are freely chosen and others ten are computed from (44). The state variables x, y and z
do not appear on the above equations, what would
allow infinite equilibrium points. The fourth chosen variable is . Therefore, these four state variables are fixed as xR , yR , zR and R . Therefore, a system defined around an equilibrium point
xR  qR 0 and reference forces uR  R is obtained.
Equation (43) can then be rewritten on the
equilibrium point as
q  M (qR )1 B(qR )R + Fext  G(qR )

x  Ax + Bu u + Bw d

(46)

where x  x  xr and u  u  ur with

In order to avoid steady state errors in closed
loop in presence of persistent disturbances, an integral action is added for each element of the trajectory. Thus, the new state vector x  24 is
defined as follows
x  x1 . . . x24   q  q 

3.2

Since the controllers designed in this paper are
based on linear systems, in order to perform the
mentioned control laws the equations of motion of
the system have to be linearized around an operating point.
Initially, consider the nonlinear continuous

As stated before, the control design via DStability is based on finding a controller that allocates closed-loop poles inside a desired region in
the complex plane (Chilali et al., 1999). Three
different type of regions are used when designing
the proposed controller 1) Left half-plane where
Re(s) < . This guarantees that the closed-loop
poles possess time constants S < 1 2) Region
inside a left-oriented cone with 2 as internal angle, where  is the angle between the Real axis and
the cones side. This guarantees that the closedloop poles possess damping ratio  < cos() 3)
Region inside a circle with center in (c, 0) and radius R.
It is possible to find a solution that encompasses all of these three constraints simultaneously. Since the system has n states and nu inputs, it is necessary to find a matrix Q  nn
with Q > 0 and Q  Q and a matrix Y  nu n
that satisfy the following inequalities

(42)

with

The dynamic equations (7) can be rewritten
in a state-form by using
q  M 1 B(q) + Fext  C(q, q)q  G(q)

(45)

It is then possible to obtain a linearized error
model given by

Linearized state-space model

(44)

(43)

from where the maps f (x), g1 (x) and g2 (x) are
directly obtained.
To linearize the system, first the equilibrium
point is computed when it fulfills x(t)  q q  0
assuming a scenario with no external disturbances
(Fext  0). Thus, the equilibrium values of the
inputs, , and generalized coordinates, q, which

allocated poles will not be too far away from the
origin of the plane, avoiding too large gains in the
controller. Figure 3 shows the poles in open loop

is given by H(s)  sup (max Hwz (j)),
with  as the singular value of a transfer function Hwz (j). Since the system dealt in this paper is MIMO, there are multiple transfer functions
Hwz (j). Thus, the H norm is given by the
systems highest frequency response gain of the
transfer function with the highest singular value.
The H norm can be interpreted as the systems
highest gain due to a disturbance input.
Therefore, by minimizing the H norm, the
effect of external disturbances on the system are
also minimized. This can be solved using the LMI
given by (52) (Dullerud and Paganini, 2000). This
approach finds a level attenuation
 and guaran
tees that H(s) < . In order to combine
this solution with the previous controller, equation
(52) is solved altogether with equations (48)-(50).

Simulations and analysis

The proposed control system has been simulated
in Matlab Simulink 2012a with the model parameters shown on Table 2. It is assumed that all
states are measured. In order to show robustness
of the designed controllers, the UAV tracked a predefined trajectory while some disturbance forces
(F xext , F yext and F zext ) affected the vehicle on
the geometric center (Figure 5). Moreover, the
simulation considered that the models masses mi
and inertia tensors Ii , for i  1, 2, 3, 4, had all uncertainties randomly ranging from 30 to 30
of their nominal values. In addition, a linear feedforward term has been added to the control action
u  Kx + uR , where

seen from this image that the H controller presented better results on tracking reference and disturbance rejection when compared to the D-stable
controller. The time evolution of the remaining
generalized coordinates are shown in Figures 8 - 9.
It is possible to see that the designed control laws
maintain them all stabilized. Figure 10 shows the
systems control inputs along with time. It is possible to verify that the inputs for the H showed
to be more aggressive than the pure D-stable controller.
Table 3 shows the mean square error of the
trajectory of the aircraft in relation with its set
point. It can be seen that except for the trajectory in the direction z the H controller achieved
better results.

Figure 10 Inputs of the system
Euler-Lagrange formulation. To design the controller, the system has been linearized around its
equilibrium point. Two controllers were synthesized one based on D-Stability and another one
improving the first one by choosing closed-loop
poles that optimizes disturbance rejection using
the H norm. Both controllers presented robustness against external disturbances, unmodeled dynamics and parametric uncertainties when evoked
to stabilize the aircraft and perform path tracking. In general the H controller achieved better
results than the D-Stable one, specially when disturbances were applied.
However, there are some drawbacks on using
linear controllers such as the designed ones. Given
that the system should always be nearby the operating point, a large deviation from this neighborhood may destabilize the UAV. This problem is
being solved by the authors of this paper, who are
presently studying nonlinear control techniques
for the Tiltrotor UAV.
As future work, the designed controllers
should be implemented in a real Tiltrotor UAV
to perform load transportation. This is part of
the ProVANT project, which is being developed
in a partnership between UFMG and UFSC.
