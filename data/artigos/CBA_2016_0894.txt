Abstract Since early 2000 a nano satellite class called CubeSat is been used by universities, companies and
military organizations to explore the space, developing researches and validating new space technologies. The
physical dimension of a one unity (1U) CubeSat, 10 cm each edge, imposes a low power generation in space orbit.
Thus, the development of power electronics for space applications demands high efficiency with size, volume,
mass and losses reduced simultaneously. Those limitations force the electrical power supply (EPS) and its power
converters efficiencies higher than 90. This paper presents a design methodology for boost power converters in
order to improve efficiency, to reduce volume and mass for 1U CubeSat EPS. Theoretical and practical results
validated the design methodology and the optimal design reached efficiencies higher than 90 respecting the 1U
CubeSat constraints.

Resumo Desde os anos 2000 uma classe de nano satelites chamada de CubeSat vem sendo utilizada por
universidades, empresas e organizacoes militares para a exploracao espacial, desenvolvendo pesquisas e validando
novas tecnologias espaciais. A dimensao fsica de um CubeSat 1U, 10 cm de aresta, impoe uma baixa geracao de
energia eletrica na orbita espacial. Assim, o desenvolvimento de eletronica de potencia para aplicacoes espaciais
demanda alto rendimento com tamanho, volume, massa e perdas eletricas reduzidas simultaneamente. Ademais,
essas limitacoes forcam a fonte de alimentacao (EPS) e seus conversores de potencia a rendimentos superiores a
90. Portanto esse trabalho apresenta uma metodologia de projeto para conversores_boost sncronos de modo a
aumentar o seu respectivo rendimento, reduzir o volume e a massa para a aplicacao de uma fonte de alimentacao
para um CubeSat 1U. Resultados teoricos e praticos validaram a metodologia e o design otimo alcancou o
rendimento superior a 90 respeitando as limitacoes de projeto impostas pelo nanossatelite.

Introduction

CubeSats are small satellites with a cubic shape
where a standard unit measures 10 cm each
edge(Munakata, 2009). This satellite topology has
been created to provide more integration among
students, professors and researchers in every space
mission step reduction of costs simplicity in the
design use of radio amateur frequency band and
space qualification of the future small payloads
(Munakata, 2009)(Puig-Suari et al., 2001).
Fundamentally, a satellite is composed by different systems like the on-board computer (OBC),
EPS, sensors, solar panels, telecommunication,
and payloads to develop a specific space mission. Thus, in this work, it is given attention to
the CubeSat EPS, which is the system responsible to generation, storage, conditioning, control and supply of electrical power to the satellite
(Patel, 2004), Figure 1.
Electrical power generation in a CubeSat is
made by photovoltaic conversion from the solar
primary source through 12 solar panels attached
to its six faces. By the way, a low electrical power
generation is available to this nanosatellite topology due to the small solar cell coverage area, which
in a 1U standard CubeSat is equal to 362.16 cm2 .

ISSN 2525-8311

Additionally, other restriction to power generation is the ratio between the eclipse time teclipse
and the orbital period Torbit in Low Earth Orbit
(LEO), which is approximately 35 minutes of sun
absense in 96 minutes of orbital period.
EPS makes an interface between the solar cells
and all the electronics systems like the OBC, payloads and sensors. Therefore, this work presents
a design methodology for a 1U CubeSat EPS
comparing different inductors and semiconductors
technologies, switching frequencies, current ripple and current density. In this project has been
used power consumption and power generation
data from Brazilian CubeSat, NANOSATC-BR1
(Programa NANOSATC-BR Desenvolvimento de
CubeSats , 2014). Additionally, constraints of
size, mass, losses and temperature for each power
converter are taken into account in the optimal
design methodology.
Numerous power converter optimization design methodologies were presented in literature
where (Sartori et al., 2009) and (Beltrame et al.,
2013) have increased up converters efficiencies up
to 99.0 . In (Lefranc et al., 2012) is presented
a buck converter optimization process called presizing, where a pareto front establishes the maximum efficiency to be reacheable by the power

Power Electronics into CubeSats

Explained in previous section, the interface between solar panels and batteries and the interface between batteries and regulated bus (5 V
and 3.3 V ) is made commomly by different power
converters. Therefore commercial and scientific
papers related to 1U CubeSat EPS were analyzed looking at power converters topology and
its efficiency. Thus, SEPIC power converter,
buck-boost and boost power converters usually
are used as battery chargers in EPS (GomSpace
NanoPower Systems, 2016)(Clyde Space Company, 2016)(Crystal Space, 2015)(Blue Canyon
Technologies , 2016)(Singh et al., 2015). Also a
linear regulator is developed in (PUMPKIN INCORPORATED, 2012). Moreover was observed
that power converter efficiencies are close to 90
in this kind of application due to small output
power and relation between input and output voltage.
The power conditioning procedure is commomnly made by buck power converters with efficiencies close to 95.(GomSpace NanoPower Systems, 2016)(Clyde Space Company, 2016)
In this work synchronous boost converters are
studied and developed in order to achieve a good
performance and higher efficiency in comparison
with conventional power converters, due to substantial losses in power diodes. As presented in

ISSN 2525-8311

previous works (Badstuebner et al., 2010) (Kolar
and Minibock, 2012) have raised power converters
efficiency has up to 99.2  when the power diode
was changed by a MOSFET in a synchronous
configuration. Moreover in CubeSat topology all
the systems have to be compact and efficient
due to the spatial distribution inside the satellite. Hence, EPS volume and mass constraints are
specified looking to NANOSATC-BR1 EPS parameters, where the specifications are presented
in Table 1 disregarding the 18650 Li-ion batteries
volume and weight.
The space mission success necessarily depends
on the availability of electrical power into the
satellite. Hence, EPS power converters have to
be reliable and designed to support satellite maximum power generation and the peak power consumption. NANOSATC-BR1 data information
has served as reference into power consumption
and generation, Table 2, where the duty cycle
term is the relation between the operational time
in space orbit.

Power losses in power electronics

Comprehend the behavior and power losses in every electronic and magnetic component are necessary steps to define an optimal design in power
electronics devices. So, this section describes
the losses modelling of inductor, semiconductor
switches and capacitor for a synchronous boost
power converter.

2.2.1

Inductor losses

Inductor losses are result of Joule effect in the
cooper windings and magnetic flux variation
within magnetic material. Core losses in every
switching period are given in (Liu et al., 2002) by
(1).

spike. When the synchronous switch is turning
off, during the dead time an intrinsic diode conducts electric current causing losses (5) (Christian
and Olivier, 2012). The diode current will be reduced to zero but the minority carriers forces the
reverse conduction until the total recombination
with oposite electric charges. This recombination
process will generate losses as presented in (6).

A synchronous configuration in power converters imposes a gate driver device which is responsible to adequate gate to source voltages for

Semiconductor switches are affected by conduction and switching losses (Mohan, 2003). Conduction losses, (4), causes heat wich elevates

Furthermore an overlap of IS1(RM S) and VdS1

When the power diode is replaced by a semiconductor switch in a synchronous configuration a

the switches against a shoot through phenomenon,
which elevate power losses in semiconductors and
can damage the component by reason of a current

duty-cycle calculation

In power electronics three important variables
have to be taken into account to design a DCDC
power converter, which are switching frequency
fsw kHz, inductor current ripple I, and current density JAcm2  which define the power converter operational point. With the increase of
I and fsw an inductor volume minimization is
achieved. Furthermore, the current density is directly related to cooper area in the inductor windings and a minimization of this therm reduces
(2) and consequently cooper losses (3). Also environmental and junction temperature increment
in semiconductor switches can amplify its power
losses.
Thereby, the presented methodology consist
in a matrix of multiple designs with different parameters, making a big computational sweep in order to find the optimal design which reach all the
1U EPS CubeSat constrains of volume, mass and
efficiency. Thus, an algorithm based on multi objective computational interactions was developed
taking into account components models and data
acquired from commercial components datasheets.
In each operational point is calculated the converter efficiency, volume, mass, magnetic core and
cooper winding losses and capacitor losses, presented in Figure 3.

Inductor design

With a switching frequency, inductor current ripple and current density sweep, different inductors
are calculated with optimal characteristics in order to minimize the electrical and magnetic losses.
The ideal powder core choice is made in accordance with the energy stored by the inductor,
maximum volume allowed for the EPS application and minimal losses and the converter minimal
inductance Lmin(boost) is calculated in accordance
with (12) to assure a specific current ripple Imax ,

of tests in the physical prototype was observed a
substantial difference among boost converter efficiency boost with varied input voltages Vin . When
Vin is increased also the boost steps up, as shown
in Figure 7. Accordingly to these results further
