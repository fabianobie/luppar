Abstract A novel approach for VSI with an LCL output filter controller design for microgrids operating
in grid-connected mode is presented in this paper. The controller structure is based on a multiloop control
configuration in which the inner control loop is responsible for current regulation and the outer control loop
generates the reference currents based on preset active and reactive power injection levels. In order to evaluate
the microgrid small-signal stability, a linearized model of the microgrid is used. The modeling approach adopted
in this paper is intrinsically modular, in the sense that models for the system components are individually
derived and then aggregated into a single microgrid model. The small-signal model includes the representation
of fast dynamic phenomena that arise with the widespread use of electronically interfaced microsources typical
of microgrid applications. Therefore, the dynamics of (i) Voltage Source Inverters (VSIs) and companion LCL
output filters (ii) VSI controllers (iii) loads, and (iv) the electrical network, can all be taken into account. The
small-signal stability analysis results are then validated through time-domain nonlinear simulations performed
with the PSCADEMTDC software package.

Introduction

Environmental, economical, technological and social impacts related to large scale power generation and transmission has led to the use of distributed energy resources (DER) in the electric
power systems. However, limitations related to
the widespread use of distributed generation (DG)
in passive distribution networks has led to the
more complex concept of microgrids (Lasseter,
2002).
A microgrid comprises a group of radial feeders connected to the main grid through a point of
common coupling (PCC). Microgrids can operate
in two modes grid-connected or islanded. In gridconnected mode, the microgrid imports or exports
power according to its internal load and generation balance, and to proper market policies. In
islanded mode, the microgrid is isolated from the
main grid and the load is supplied only by local
microsources (Lasseter, 2002).
Microsources are generally connected to
the microgrid through power electronic interfaces (Lasseter, 2002). The most used interface
device is the three-phase pulse-width modulation

(PWM) voltage-source inverter (VSI).
An important characteristic of microsources
is their low or even null inertia (Chowdhury
et al., 2009), which makes the dominant microgrid dynamics lie in the range of frequencies higher
than the classic electromechanical oscillations of
conventional power systems. Therefore, it is necessary to derive mathematical models that take
into account the fast dynamic behavior of microgrid components, such as VSI output filters and
the network.
To perform microgrid small-signal stability
analysis and VSI controller design, it is necessary to derive a linearized microgrid model considering the VSIs dynamics, their respective controllers, and the network. This issue has already
been investigated by Katiraei et al. (2007), where
the VSI output filter is a simple L filter. Rese et al.
(2012b) performed this task considering more effective LCL filters, which also exhibit more complex dynamics.
The objective of this paper is to propose a
novel control structure and a design procedure for
VSIs with an LCL output filter, applicable to microgrids operating in grid-connected mode. Fur-

thermore, a brief description of a microgrid smallsignal model for grid-connected operating mode,
originally proposed by Rese et al. (2012b), is presented. This linearized model is only used to perform VSI controller design and small-signal stability analysis of a microgrid test system. Results
of small-signal stability analysis and controller design based on the developed linearized model are
validated through nonlinear time-domain simulations performed with the PSCADEMTDC software package.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2
presents the derivation of the microgrid smallsignal model. Section 3 describes the proposed
VSI controller structure for grid-connected operating mode. The methodology employed for VSI
controller design is presented in Section 4. The
small-signal stability analysis and VSI controller
design for a specific microgrid test system, as well
as time-domain nonlinear simulations results, are
presented in Section 5. Section 6 presents some
concluding remarks.

Microgrid Small-Signal Model

In this paper, the microgrid small-signal model is
derived in a modular way so that the linearized
state-space equations of each microgrid component can be developed individually, as done by
Rese et al. (2012b). It is assumed that the microgrid operates in balanced conditions and that
every microgrid component is represented in a dq
reference frame.
The description of VSI and network models
are given in Subsections 2.1 and 2.3, respectively.
The detailed equations of these models are given
in (Rese et al., 2012b) and are not reproduced in
this paper due to space limitations. The complete
description of the VSI controller employed in this
paper is given in Section 3.
2.1

VSI model

The general representation of a VSI connected to
the network through an LCL filter is shown in
Fig. 1. In this paper, the dynamic behavior of the
DC side is not taken into account so that it can
be represented by an ideal DC voltage source.

Network

Figure 1 Topology of a three-phase VSI with an
LCL filter

The LCL output filter is used to attenuate
inverter switching harmonics. This filter is more
adequate than an L and LC filters in microgrid applications because, in addition to providing higher

ISBN 978-85-8001-069-5

high-frequency attenuation with the same inductance value, it is also suitable to operation in
both grid-connected and islanded modes (Yang
et al., 2011).
The VSI model is obtained via the State-Space
Averaging Technique (Erickson and Maksimovic,
2001). The resulting linearized model of the k -th
three-phase VSI with an LCL output filter in the
dq-frame is given by
xk  Ak xk + Bv,k vdq,k + Bc,k uc,k
yk  Ck xk + Dv,k vdq,k + Dc,k uc,k

(1)

where xk is the VSI state vector, vdq,k is the input
grid voltage vector, uc,k is the VSI control input
vector, yk is the output vector (grid-side current),
Ak , Bv,k , Bc,k , Ck , Dv,k and Dr,k are the state-space
model matrices. Details on the derivation of (1)
are given in (Rese et al., 2012a).
2.2

VSI controller

In microgrids operating in grid-connected mode,
the VSI controller objective is to regulate the VSI
output power to follow preset active and reactive
power references, using only local information as
inputs. The k -th VSI control system state-space
equation is given by
xc,k  Ac,k xc,k + Bv,c,k vdq,k + Bi,c,k idq,k + Br,c,k Sref,k
yc,k  Cc,k xc,k + Dv,c,k vdq,k + Di,c,k idq,k + Dr,c,k Sref,k

(2)

where xc,k is the controller state vector, idq,k is
the VSI grid-side current vector, Sref,k is the reference input vector, Ac,k , Bv,c,k , Bi,c,k , Br,c,k , Cc,k ,
Dv,c,k , Di,c,k and Dr,c,k are the state-space model
matrices. The complete description of the VSI
controller model is given in Section 3.
2.3

Network model

Microgrids make widespread use of electronically
interfaced microsources. These sources have low
or even null inertia, which makes it necessary to
take into account some fast dynamic phenomena
as, for example, network and VSI filter dynamics.
In this paper, the network state equations,
represented in a dq reference frame, are derived
according to the same methodology employed by
Anderson et al. (1989) and Parniani and Iravani
(1995). It is assumed that every line or transformer can be represented by a series RL branch.
The node representing the main grid is represented as an infinite node and is modeled as an
ideal three-phase voltage source. For network
modeling purposes, microsources are represented
as current sources connected to the generation
nodes. Loads are represented as series RL or parallel RC circuits, although more complex dynamic
load models could also be used.
The network small-signal model is then derived through a systematic procedure based on
graph theory (Deo, 1974), which facilitates its
computer implementation and also the extension

of the proposed methodology to other microgrid
configurations. The resulting network small-signal
model is given by
xn  An xn + Bn un
yn  Cn xn + Dn un

(3)

where xn is the network state vector, un is the
network input vector, An , Bn , Cn and Dn are the
state-space model matrices. Details on the derivation of (3) and the resulting state-space model matrices are given in (Rese et al., 2012b).

state-space models requires that every system
component be represented with respect to a common (global) reference frame. The relationship
between the k -th local reference frame and the
global reference frame is depicted in Fig. 2.

VSI Controller

3.1

The objective of VSI control in microgrids operating in grid-connected mode is to ensure active and
reactive power injection levels according to preset
values as well as to provide active damping for the
LCL filter. In this paper, the VSI controller is implemented in the dq reference frame, which makes
the control problem a constant reference tracking
problem.
Implementation of VSI controller in dq frame
requires local information about grid frequency
and phase angle to perform the dq0 transformation and to synchronize the VSI with the grid.
This can be accomplished through the use of a
Phase-Locked Loop (PLL). The PLL system, implemented in dq reference frame, uses a PI controller to track the phase angle of the grid voltage. The lock is realized by setting the reference of q-axis to zero so that, in steady-state,
vq  0 (Chung, 2000).
The control strategy used in this paper is
based on the multiloop controller configuration
shown in Fig. 4. The current controller (inner
loop) is responsible for providing active damping
to the VSIs LCL output filter, as well as to ensure reference current tracking capability. The activereactive power controllers (outer loop) are responsible for generating the d- and q- axis reference currents based on preset active and reactive
power injection levels.

Measurement filtering block

The measurement filtering block comprises four
first-order low-pass filters (LPF) for the dq components of VSI output current and terminal voltage. The linearized state equations of the filter
module are given by

Activereactive power control loop

In this paper, the convention used for abc to dq0
reference frame transformation assumes that the
quadrature axis leads the direct axis, and also
maintains the one-to-one correspondence between
peak values of voltages and currents in abc and dq0
frames (Kundur, 1994). In consequence, the expressions for active and reactive power injections
are given by

According to (10), active and reactive power injection must be controlled through d - and q-axis
current components, respectively. It should be noticed that a positive reactive power reference results in a negative q-axis current. As consequence,
the reactive power control loop exhibits an inverse
response characteristic.
Direct- and quadrature-axis reference currents are obtained through two PI controllers one

3.3

Current control loop

The current control strategy employed in this paper is based on the state-feedback theory, as already proposed by Rese et al. (2012a). This
multivariable control strategy avoids the use of
major approximations generally used for decoupling d - and q-axis variables (Green and Prodanovic, 2007).
State-feedback controllers require, in principle, the measurement of all state variables, which
turns this approach unfeasible in most real applications. In order to circumvent this problem,
a state observer is employed (Chen, 1984), making it possible to estimate all state variables with
only measurements of the VSI output current and
knowing VSI input control signals.
Another characteristic of state-feedback controllers is that they cannot ensure reference tracking. However, reference tracking capability can
be achieved by placing integrators in the forward
path in series with the plant inputs. It should
be noticed that every placed integrator increases
the size of the plant by 1, requiring an augmented
plant model, given by

The state-feedback controller design is then
carried out using (13), resulting in the state feedback gain matrix K along with the integrators

carried out using the original plant model (without the integrators), resulting in a gain matrix L.
Matrices K, KI and L are obtained through a pole
placement procedure (Chen, 1984).

VSI Controller Design

In this paper, the controller design is performed
considering VSI local models, that is, assuming
that each inverter is directly connected to an infinite node. This is done because, in microgrid applications, the network topology and the number
and location of connected microsources and loads
are unknown, due to consumer active participation (Chowdhury et al., 2009). Therefore, there is
no point in designing these controllers considering
preset microgrid configurations.
The VSI controller design procedure is divided
into two parts the current control loop is first
designed, and then the activereactive power controller design is performed.

The final VSI controller state-space model is obtained by connecting equations (12) and (14) according to the inputoutput relationships shown
in Fig. 4. The resulting state-space model is given

Current controller design

Designing the state-feedback current controller requires the specification of the desired closed-loop
eigenvalues location. The desired eigenvalues are
computed by moving the poor damped modes to
the left of the complex plane without changing
their imaginary parts in order to satisfy a minimum damping ratio specification. This amounts
to computing new values for the eigenvalues real
parts that meet the specification, as follows
 min  ij

Small-Signal Stability Analysis and

The microgrid test system used in this paper is based on the CERTS Microgrid Test
Bed (Lasseter, 2009). This microgrid is composed of 8 nodes, 2 microsources and 4 inductive
loads, as shown in Fig. 7. Node 1 represents the
point of common coupling (PCC) of the microgrid
to the utility system. System operating point,
network and VSI parameters are given in (Rese

be noticed that only VSI-4 controller design is presented. However, a similar procedure is employed
for VSI-7.

VSI controller design

The minimum damping ratio specified for the current control loop design is 35. Gain matrices K,
KI and L are obtained through a pole placement
algorithm implemented in Matlab and are not presented in this paper due to space limitations.
Once the state-feedback and observer gain
matrices are known, it is then necessary to specify initial values for the activereactive power PI
controllers parameters. In this paper, these initial
values are chosen as presented in Table 1.

Figure 8 shows the root locus with the minimum damping ratio specification for the VSI-4

be seen that, despite the fact that the minimum

The resulting root-locus and step responses
for the VSI-4 controller designed according to the
methodology described in Section 4 are given in
Fig. 10 and 11, respectively. It can be seen that
the tuned controller satisfies all controller design
specifications. Final parameters for both VSI-4

controller design procedure does not consider the
complete microgrid small-signal model. A possible
solution for this problem could be the use of more
advanced controller design techniques that would
take into account parametric uncertainties in the
VSI model. The use of the complete microgrid
model for controller design is discarded because,
in microgrid applications, there is a high level of
uncertainty about the network topology and the
number of loads and microsources connected to
the microgrid.

Nonlinear time-domain simulations

Time-domain simulations of the microgrid system
shown in Fig. 7, including the VSI controllers, has
been performed using the PSCADEMTDC software package. These simulations are used to validate the results obtained through the microgrid
eigenanalysis and also to check the performance of
the proposed VSI controller. It should be emphasized that the simulations are carried out using
nonlinear models for the PLL and the microgrid,
as well as the switching model of the VSIs, thus
enabling the representation of the non-modeled
dynamics excited by the switching actions of the
VSIs.
Figure 12 shows VSI-4 responses of activereactive power injection, d - and q-axis components of grid-side current and grid-side currents in abc frame for the following events at
t  200 ms, active power reference is changed
from 0 kW to 20.0 kW, while the reactive power
reference is kept at 0. At t  550 ms, active and
reactive power references are changed to 30 kW
and 5 kVAr, respectively.

Small-signal stability analysis

Eigenvalue calculation results for the microgrid
test system are given in Table 3 (only modes
with damping ratio lower than 35 are shown).
These eigenvalues were obtained using the microgrid small-signal model presented in Subsection 2.5. The eigenvalues indicate that the microgrid system is stable, although some modes
exhibit a somewhat low level of damping. The
reason for these low damped modes is that the

It can be noticed that, in both cases, the proposed VSI control strategy proved to be a good
alternative for VSIs operating in grid-connected
mode. It is also possible to validate the results
obtained through the eigenanalysis presented in
Subsection 5.2.

Conclusion

The mathematical formulation of a small-signal
model of microgrids operating in grid-connected
mode, including the dynamics of VSIs with LCL
output filters and network representation, has
also been proposed. This model is suitable for
the analysis of complex dynamic phenomena that
arise with the widespread use of VSIs in microgrid
applications.
A VSI controller structure for operation in
grid-connected mode, as well as the controller design procedure, has been presented. This controller has proven to be able to meet the specifications for the connection of the VSI to microgrids
operating in grid-connected mode. The validation
of the proposed VSI control strategy has been carried out through small-signal stability analysis using the developed model, as well as time-domain
nonlinear simulations via PSCADEMTDC software package.
It must be emphasized that the developed
control structure is intended to application only
in grid-connected operating mode. The VSI control problem for islanded operating mode will be
addressed in future research work.
