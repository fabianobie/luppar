Abstract This paper presents a model-free alternative for the adaptive dead zone compensation in control
systems. A controller parametrization that completely cancels out the dead zone is used in conjunction with
the data-based control (DBC) method Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning (VRFT) in order to identify the
parameters of this new dead zone canceling controller which achieves a desired reference model. Simulation
results demonstrate the validity of the proposed parametrization and the statistical properties of the solution
under noisy conditions is analyzed.

Introduction

Many physical components of control systems are
appropriately modeled as a static nonlinearity, either at the input or at the output of the plant.
This static nonlinear behavior is particularly common in actuators, and the description of the linear plant in series with such a static nonlinearity at its input results in a nonlinear system to
be controlled which is of the so called  type. These nonlinearities are usually poorly
known a priori and their characteristics may vary
with time, which has driven many works on their
identication - e.g. (Vanbeylen et al., 2009 Lauwers, L. et al., 2009 Aguirre et al., 2005). Once a
model for the whole system - linear part plus the
static nonlinearity - is available, model-based control can be applied, which is usually accomplished
by designing separately a linear controller and a
nonlinearity compensation.
In this paper we present an alternative for the
tuning of these controllers with nonlinearity compensation which is direct - that is, model-free and where the linear controller and the nonlinear
compensation are tuned at once. The method is
an extension for the control of nonlinear_systems
of the  type of the Virtual Reference
Feedback Tuning (VRFT) and as such inherits the
nice properties of the VRFT methodology.
The VRFT method for the control of nonlinear_systems has been proposed in (Campi and
Savaresi, 2006). In this paper we extend the core

idea of VRFT for the case where the process is
of the  type and apply it to nonlinearities with dead-zone characteristics. Dead-zone
compensation is particularly appealing in this context, as data-driven methods are tailored for the
industrial environment and there seems to be not
much experimental evidence of their applicability
to systems with dead-zone - although some can
be found in, e.g. Hjalmarsson et al. (1998), Flores
da Cunha and Bazanella (2010). The proposed
method is based on a linear parametrization of
the dead zone canceling controller, which allows
its automatic tuning by means of least-squares optimization, just like in standard VRFT.
Dead-zones are found in many physical systems, often as a representation of nonlinear friction in mechanical actuators, but also in several other classes of control systems - for example, in an H-bridge in an electrical actuator.
Dead zones lead to steady state errors in the
system output and degradation in the transient
performance, and can also lead to limit cycles
(Zhonghua et al., 2006). Learning dead-zone
compensation schemes already exist for adaptive (Recker et al., 1991) and fuzzy controllers
(Campos and Lewis, 1999). The fuzzy controller
still requires that a plant model is known and,
while this is not necessary for the adaptive_controllers, the solution becomes more involved in
this case (Tao and Kokotovic, 1994). The alternative proposed in this paper does not suer from

these limitations.
This paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we present the idea behind data-based control, notations and some hypotheses. Section 3
presents the Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning
method and section 4 enunciates the dead-zone
compensation problem. Section 5 contains the results of this work, that is, the proposed controller
parametrization for dead-zone cancellation in a
model free framework. A case study is presented
on section 6 and the properties of the solution are
presented and analyzed. Section 7 concludes this

where we have now made the dependence on the
controller parameters  explicit in the output signal y(t, ).
2.1

The Model Reference Control Problem

We want the closed-loop to achieve a given performance which is specied by a desired closedloop transfer function

Preliminaries

Consider a linear time-invariant discrete-time
single-input single-output process
y(t)  G(z)u(t) + (t),

(1)

where z is the forward time-shift operator, G(z)
is the process transfer function, assumed rational
and proper, u(t) is the control input and (t) is
the process noise. The noise is a quasi-stationary
process which can be written as (t)  H(z)e(t),
where e(t) is white noise with variance e2 . This
process is controlled by a linear time-invariant
controller C(z, ) which is assumed to have a parametric structure as specied below.

min J()






J()  E (y(t, )  yd (t))2  E y(t, )2 . (5)
Under hypothesis (3), the cost function (5)
can be divided into two terms
(6)

where each term represents a conceptually dierent control objective

C(z, )  T C(z),
where   D  Rp and C(z) is a column vector
of xed rational functions.
It is further assumed that C(z, )G(z) has
positive relative degree for all   D . Some of the
most common controller structures are linearly
parameterized, PID with xed derivative pole being the most popular. One such parameterization
can be written as

Jy ()  E ((Td (z)  T (z, ))r(t))2 
 noise rejection


Je ()  E (S(z)(t))2 .
Once the reference model Td (z) is chosen, the
corresponding closed-loop performance can be exactly achieved with the ideal controller
Cd (z) 

The control action u(t) is given by
(2)

where r(t) is the reference signal, which is assumed
to be quasi-stationary and uncorrelated with the
noise, that is
E r(t)e(s)  0 t, s

called reference model in the literature. We thus
search for the controller parameters that make the
output of the system the closest to the desired one,
by solving the following optimization problem.

u(t)  C(z, )(r(t)  y(t)),

yd (t)  Td (z)r(t),

Td (z)
.
G(z)(1  Td (z))

(7)

This is the controller that minimizes the reference tracking criterion Jy . If and only if the
ideal controller Cd (z) belongs to the Controllers
Class in consideration, will the system behave exactly as specied by the reference model. We shall
formalize this assumption

This assumption can be fullled if the reference models and controllers structures are adequately predetermined. The knowledge of the
plants transfer function structure suces in order to accomplish this, as illustrated in the next
example.
Example
Consider a second order plant with the following structure
G(z) 

kz
(z  z1 )(z  z2 )

(8)

where z1 , z2  0, 1 are the systems poles and k 
R represents the static gain. Those values are all
unknown to the designer and, thus, are not used
in order to decide on a particular reference model.
Let us also consider that the controller is a
PID with the following structure
C(z, )

Therefore, choosing a rst order reference model

then for every m  0, 1 Assumption 2 is satised.
This can be easily proved by substituting Td (z) (9)
and G(z) (8) in (7).
A variety of data-driven control methods rely
on the above formulation VRFT, Iterative Feedback Tuning (IFT) (Hjalmarsson et al., 1998),
Correlation-based Tuning (CbT) (Karimi et al.,
2004), to_name_a_few. The statistical properties
of the solution, and in the case of iterative methods also the convergence properties of the corresponding algorithm, depend strongly on the degree to which Assumption 2 is violated (Bazanella
et al., 2012).

The Virtual Reference Feedback
Tuning method

The VRFT method possesses two important characteristics. First, the method treats the reference
tracking problem (that is, it only aims to minimize
Jy ()). The second is that VRFT is a one-shot
method, meaning that it is not iterative, a desirable characteristic concerning its practical implementation. VRFTs central idea is to turn the
controller design problem into an identication
problem, that is, identifying the ideal controller
by means of a prediction error method (Campi
et al., 2002). Input (u(t)) and output (y(t)) data
from the process are obtained during its regular
operation and are then considered to be obtained
as if the ideal controller, Cd (z), was operating in
the closed-loop system. In order to do this, a
reference signal is calculated such that, when applied to the system operating in closed loop with

ISBN 978-85-8001-069-5

the ideal controller, the systems output would be
the same as the output signal obtained during the
experiment (r(t)  Td1 (z)y(t)). This calculated
reference is called a virtual reference, hence the
methods name. Having calculated this virtual
reference, it is possible to determine a virtual error
(e(t)  r(t)  y(t)) and then, having the e(t) and
u(t) signals at ones disposal, the goal is to identify the system that, with e(t) applied to its input,
generates u(t) at its output. This becomes, then,
the problem of identifying the optimal controller
Cd (z). The identication of Cd (z) by minimization of the prediction error consists in solving the
following problem
min JV RF T ()
JV RF T () 

N
1 
(u(t)  C(z, )e(t))2
N t1

(10)

Note that JV RF T () is not the performance
criterion that we are supposed to minimize, Jy ().
However, when Assumption 2 is satised the argument which minimizes both JV RF T () and Jy ()
is the same and, as such, the VRFT method nds
the desired result. Since JV RF T () is a quadratic
function, the solution to its optimization problem
is of a least squares form and is direct, unlike the
minimization of Jy (), which is necessarily iterative. Thus VRFT obtains an estimate on the
controller parameters  by the following calculation

for instance
(t)  C(z) Td1 (z)  1 ys (t),
where ys (t) is the output obtained from a second
experiment, identical to the rst except for a different realization of the noise. This instrumental
variable is used in order to remove the bias in
the parameters estimate due to system noise - it
should be noted that this particular choice of IVs
requires the experiments to be performed in openloop.

Dead-Zone parametrization and its
inverse
Dead-Zone parametrization

The dead-zone is a nonlinearity in which a range
of input values gives zero output (Tao and Kokotovic, 1996), as represented in g. 1.

The analytical expression for the dead-zone is
given by

controlled - comprised of a non linear input block
followed by the linear plant -, with a Wiener controller preceding it - a linear controller C(, z) and
an output non-linear block consisting of the dead
zone compensation.

if v(t)  br ,
if bl < u(t) < br ,

(12)

where DZ() denotes the dead-zone function, ml
and mr are the slopes of the dead zone, bl is
the lower bound and br is the dead zones upper
bound. When ml  mr and bl  br , the deadzone is said to be symmetrical.
Dead-zones cause steady-state errors and
loss of transient performance in control systems.
These nasty eects can be eliminated by the insertion of the dead-zones inverse in the loop, as
shown in Figure 2.

VRFT with dead-zone compensation

To ease the notation - with no loss of generality, as will be pointed out briey -, the dead zone
slopes are considered equal and unitary. Whenever u(t) > 0, the control signal with dead zone
compensation must be given by
v(t)  T C(z)e(t) + r .

This control law can be parametrized linearly
as in assumption 1,

Dead-Zone inverse

Assuming that the parameters of the dead-zone
are known, its eect in the closed-loop performance can be eliminated by applying to the control action its inverse function

for the positive case. If the above condition is not satised then the input to the plant
will be null and so will be its output, and hence
there will not be enough information to identify
the controller. The extension to negative inputs
(u(t) < 0) is straightforward by observing that the
control signal then becomes v(t)  u(t) + l .
Since the dead-zone size is unknown, (20) cannot be guaranteed to hold true unless an upper
bound for the dead zone is known - note that
this estimate needs not be exact, not even accurate, as long as it is guaranteed to be larger than
the actual dead zone size. Saturation non withstanding, (20) can always be satised with a large
enough control signal. This parametrization does
not identify the value of the dead zone slopes, ml
and mr , but these slopes will be accounted for in
the controller gains, , and since the goal is to cancel out, not identify, the dead zone, determining
these slopes directly is not necessary - hence the
unitary gain consideration. In the case where the
slopes andor dead zone values are not symmetrical, the procedure should be done one time for
each segment, resulting in a piecewise controller,
one for the positive region and another one for the
negative region. Note that under assumption 2 it
is possible to achieve exactly the reference model
in closed-loop.

When theres noise in the system, simulations

procedure. It is clear that, even though shaped
rather dierently, both functions have the same
minimizer and, hence, the dead zone is completely
canceled out.
Figure 6 presents the contour plots of Jy and
JV RF T for the standard VRFT parametrization ,
that is, a simple PI controller with no dead zone
compensation. It shows the expected fact that
the global minimum of JV RF T is not the same as
in the proposed parametrization. Even worse, Jy
and JV RF T do not have the same minimum.
System aected by noise

With H(z)  1 and the noise variance e  0.547,
yielding a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR, dened as
the square root of the ratio of the output signals power and the noises power) of 12.89 we
performed 2000 Monte Carlo runs of the proposed
VRFT parametrization. An average controller is
determined by taking the mean of each one of the
gains, whose distribution is shown on gure 8.

Conclusions

We have presented a model free alternative for
dead zone compensation embedded in the VRFT
framework. The method yields very good results when noise levels are moderate and the system is in a class such that the chosen reference
model can be achieved by a reasonable controller
parametrization. Simulations presented in the paper suggest that the proposed algorithm works

well under such assumptions but, when noise levels increase, the quality of the estimates deteriorate, with noticeable closed-loop performance
degradation. The statistical properties are similar
to the ones obtained for purely linear controllers.
A formal statement of the statistical properties of
the method as well as experimental results and
a deeper analysis for the case when the reference
model is not achievable remain open questions for
future works. This method illustrates the use and
the properties of VRFT when applied in  systems, further specifying the results in
Campi and Savaresi (2006) for a controller with a
non linear Wiener structure. The same approach
can be applied to cancel out the eects of other
classes of invertible nonlinearities in 
systems.
