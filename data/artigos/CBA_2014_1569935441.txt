Abstract In this paper a proposal for redesign PI controllers with Symmetrical Optimum (SO) based design
is presented. The method, introduced by the authors and called Modified Symmetrical Optimum (MSO), uses an
integration plus first-order model, identified from two frequency points obtained from combined relay experiment.
The proposal for the identification of the used model is also presented. The MSO idea is to apply a parameterized
SO method to get a controller with stability and robustness aspects. The results analysis is performed by
simulation examples.

1958) has presented the concept of Symmetrical
Optimum Method (SO). In this context, the process is reduced to a model that assumes integrators plus fast dynamics (small time constants and
delays) captured by a single parameter to result
in a slope with 20dBdec in the bode plot in
frequency response close to crossover frequency.
With the simplicity of the method, (Voda and
Landau, 1995) have showed a SO expansion with
a calibration method called PID controller tuning
rules KLV (Kessler-Landau-Voda). The method,
combined with the relay experiments, has the advantage of robustness in many respects in the frequency domain. The controller can be adjusted
by simple tuning rules with guaranteed stability and robustness from information obtained in
the frequency 135 . Still with the SO, there
are recent studies. (Preitl and Precup, 1999)
and (Preitl et al., 2011) have implemented extensions and parameterization of the original method.
(Papadopoulos et al., 2011) with extension in
(Papadopoulos et al., 2012) have showed the principles of their application that aims to tune PID
controller for the final output of the closed loop
system results in the elimination of higher-order,
position, velocity and acceleration errors and others control strategies.

Introduction

The PID controller is the most common solution
to practical control problems. This can be attributed to its robust performance and simplicity
to get the tuning parameters. Depending on the
dynamics of the process and the way that the controller is being applied, the task to get the three
controller parameters can not be so simple. Furthermore, it is necessary to choose among the various existing tuning techniques to obtain the desired performance. In the industrial environment,
in most cases, there is not much information about
the dynamics of the process, which can complicate
the control design. To perform an experiment to
get the plant by mathematical models becomes an
alternative to adjust the parameters of control design.
Among the contributions in tuning PID controllers, (Ziegler and Nichols, 1942) is the major
reference. Over time, several modifications to the
original experiment appeared in order to improve
different aspects of the project. (Astrom and Hagglund, 1984) have presented the tuning of PI and
PID controllers based on the identification of the
frequency response to obtain the gain and phase
margins of the process plant. The relay experiment was modified later in (Leva, 1993) with the
introduction of a variable delay in the loop in order
to obtain different information of the frequency response of the process.
From the viewpoint of PID tuning, other studies are rather quoted in the literature. (Kessler,

This paper treats the use of SO for tuning PI
controllers, aiming to obtain a stable controller

pole, as described in (3), this pole is used as a limiting factor for the crossover frequency resulting

For PI controllers, the model used is

Assume that the PI controller C (s) was de
signed using the estimated model G(s)
and the SO
based design. For processes which such a model

G(s)
is not a good approximation, the robustness
properties of the SO can be lost.
The problem statement is given a process
G(s), important information about the process
can be obtained using relay experiments, including

the process model G(s).
Using these information,
the designed SO controller based on the model

G(s)
is evaluated using the experimental data and
modified SO based controller is suggested.

respectively.
Consider Tk  T . In the region close to
the crossover frequency of the system, an approximated model can be obtained by a cascade
of pure integrators (1(1 + sTk )  1sTk ) for
(  1(2T )).
This technique has the advantage of robustness in various aspects (phase margin, gain margin, sensitivity and processes dynamics). In Fig. 1
is illustrated the Bode Diagram of the open loop

Figure 2 Proposed Excitation.
The excitation is composed of two components, high and low frequencies parts. To generate
the high frequency part, insert a relay and get an
oscillation around the critical frequency (180 )
(Astrom and Hagglund, 1984). To obtain the low
frequency part, add an integrator in series with
the relay. The block diagram shown in Fig. 3 represents the proposed experiment, where yr , u and

For the frequency information obtained from
the proposed relay experiment (180 and 90 ),
the matrices Z and  can be rewritten in the form
of (10) and (11), respectively.
Note that matrices Z and  contains complex
elements. Separating the real and imaginary parts
of the least squares relation (13), gives (9).

From the regression vector defined in Lemma
1 and information from the frequencies 180 and
90 the best fit of the gain K  and time constant
T are estimated using least-squares.
With the procedure described above, this
identification for several classes of processes was
performed. The results are shown in Table 1 and
the Bode diagram for some of the processes in
Figs 4, 5 and 6. For all listed processes, the identified parameters K  and T match a good magnitude model around 90 , 180 and the crossover
frequency region. On the other side, the phase
estimate is very poor.

The frequency responses at these frequencies
can be estimated by applying the Discrete Fourier
Transform (DFT) to data set y(t) and u(t).

The Integrating Model Estimation

Consider that the process will be represented
by the transfer function model described in (1),

The choice of  is based on the information
obtained by the point p found according to the
technique described in the previous section. Using
gain margin (typically 2 to 8 (Astrom and Hagglund, 2006)) as criterion to redesign the PI controller, for a gain margin of gm ,

Simulation Examples

Example 1
Consider the process with transfer function
G(s)

(27)
Applying the proposed identification method,
the estimated model is

(26)

Note there is an error between p and where
the transfer function G(j)C(j) crosses the real
axis. This  is calculated to get a gain margin of
gm in the p point. This value of  can be also
increased to get more conservative controllers and
less oscillatory responses or to get others values of
gain margin. For this, just insert the respective
value of the gain margin in (26).
The procedure can be summarized in following algorithm

Conclusions

The Symmetrical Optimum has been used to obtain a PI controller for several classes of process.
A procedure to obtain a model and stability analysis was performed. Sometimes, the processes
were lead to instability due to the restrictions of
the original tuning method. Finding the p point
with the proposed identification method plus the
original SO method, one can relate it to instability. A small handling in the original rules tuning
method, increasing it with the parameter , can
eventually make it efficient, leading the processes
in the simulations to an initial stable controller
with line gain margin equal to gm , with guaranteed stability, which was the main objective of this
work.
