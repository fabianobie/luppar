Abstract This paper describes a simple and accurate angular position estimation algorithm for a permanent magnet synchronous motor which is based on a modification of the Luenberger observer. The Luenberger observer is used to estimate the backelectromotive forces in the stationary  reference systems. The conventional approach considers the derivatives of the backelectromotive forces as negligible. However, this assumption is not true for high mechanical speeds. In this paper, a better spacestate model of the motor is proposed, using the derivatives of the back-electromotive forces defined in an average operation
point. The proposed state-space model represents more accurately the dynamics of the motor than the conventional model, allowing a better estimation of the back-electromotive forces. Thus, better observer and observation matrices can be obtained. The
observation matrix is set through Linear Matrix Inequalities. Simulation results show that the proposed observer is more accurate
than the conventional Luenberger observer.

Resumo Este artigo descreve um algoritmo de estimação de posição_angular para um motor síncrono de ímã permanente simples e preciso, o qual está baseado em uma modificação no observador de Luenberger. O observador de Luenberger é usado para
estimar as forças contra-eletromotrices no sistema estacionário . A técnica convencional considera que as derivadas das forças contra-eletromotrices são consideradas como desprezíveis. Não obstante, esta consideração não é certa para altas velocidades
mecânicas. Neste artigo, foi desenvolvido um melhor modelo em espaço_de_estado do motor, usando as derivadas das forças contra eletromotrizes em um ponto médio de operação. O modelo em espaço estado proposto representa melhor a dinâmica do motor
que o modelo convencional. Desta maneira, melhores observadores e matriz de observação são obtidas. A matriz de realimentação é definida através de inequações lineares matriciais. Resultados de simulação mostram que o observador proposto é mais
preciso que o observador de Luenberger convencional.

Introduction

Nowadays, Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) is a powerful alternative in the development of small and medium variable frequency drives
and servomechanisms due to its better relation
torqueweight and robustness than DC motors. On the
other hand, PMSM has less rotor power losses and
less torque ripple than induction motors (Uddin et al.,
2000 Rashid, 2001 Terzic and Jadric, 2001).
In order to control a PMSM, it is necessary information about the angular position and speed. Sensors
such as encoders and resolvers can be used as position transducer. However, it can increase the cost and
reduce the robustness of the motor drive. For that
reason, many researches were done to eliminate the
need for position sensors in motor drives, i.e., a sensorless control (Teja et al., 2015). These sensorless
algorithms are based in techniques such as sliding
mode observers (Bernardes et al., 2014 Zhao et al.,
2014), Kalman filters (Alonge et al., 2014 Quang et
al., 2014), MRAS (Fan et al., 2012), injection of
high-frequency signals (Wang et al., 2013 Luo et al.,
2016),
Luenberger
observers
(STMICROELECTRONICS, 2007) and others.

ISSN 2525-8311

Many of these algorithms are precise but have high
computational costs. On the other hand, Luenberger
observer is simple to implement the observer is used
to estimate the back-electromotive forces in the stationary  reference system. The angular position
and mechanical speed are calculated through the estimated back-electromotive forces. However, the
conventional approach assumes that the derivative of
the back-electromotive force is near to zero
(STMICROELECTRONICS, 2007). This assumption
is not true for high speeds.
For these reason, this paper presents a modification
of the Luenberger observer in order to increase the
accuracy of the angle estimation for a PMSM, without increasing significantly the complexity of the
observer. This approach considers that the derivatives
of the back-electromotive forces in the stationary
reference system are not zero. This consideration
adds non-linear terms to the state matrix of the observer. However, in order to avoid a non-linear
space-state observer, these derivatives are defined in
an average operation point. Additionally, it is consider that the acceleration of the motor is small. Thus,
the new terms of the state matrix are constant, and the
proposed Luenberger observer is still linear.

The observation matrix of the proposed Luenberger
matrix is set through Linear Matrix Inequalities
(LMIs). The new state matrix of the proposed observer also changes the structure of the observation
matrix.
This paper is organized as follows Section 2 describes the modeling of a PMSM and the Luenberger
observer applied to the angle estimation. Section 3
describes the proposed modified Luenberger observer. Section 4 shows simulations results that validate
the proposed technique. Finally, conclusions and
future works are presented.
2 Theoretical Foundations
2.1 Modeling of a PMSM
The high number of parameters and the timevarying inductances make the three-phase model of a
PMSM inadequate for the analysis of this kind of
motor. In order to get a better model of a PMSM,
Park transformation is used to represent three-phase
quantities in the dq orthogonal reference system (Pillay and Krishnan, 1991)

 sin( ) sin(  k ) sin(  k )   xa 
 x   2 cos( ) cos(  k ) cos(  k )  x 
 q 3
 b

where k  23, xa xb xcT are the vector with the
three-phase quantities (voltages, currents or fluxes),
xd xq x0T is the vector with the new dq variables,
while  is the angle of the new reference system.
Usually,   e  n, where e is the electrical angle
of the PMSM, n the number of pair of poles and  is
the shaft angle. The following equations define the dq
model of the PMSM

Replacing (6) in (4), we get

However, many speed observers are based on the
stationary  model of the PMSM, which is obtained
through Park transformation in (1) when   0. In that
case, PMSM can be modeled by the following equations

2.2 Speed Estimation for a PMSM based on Luenberger Observer
The space-state model of a linear system can be
defined as follows

x  Ax  Bu

(12)

where x is the state vector, u is the input vector, y is
the output, A is the state matrix, B is the input matrix
and C is the output matrix. The Luenberger observer
has the following structure

where vd and vq are the dq stator voltages, id and iq
are the dq stator currents, r is the stator resistance, ld
and lq are the dq stator inductances, m is the equivalent flux of the magnets, tem is the electromagnetic
torque, tload is the load torque, jr is the rotor inertia,
bm is the coefficient of friction, and m is the mechanical speed (the derivative of ). The d-axis and q-axis
inductances of a PMSM with non-salient poles are
equal

where L is the observation matrix, while xest and yest
are the estimated state vector and output vector, respectively. From (12) and (13), we have

x  x est  A(x  x est )  L(y  y est )
 A(x  x est )  LC(x  x est )

(14)

 ( A  LC)( x  x est )
Let z  x  xest be the error vector. Thus, (14) can be
rewritten as follows

From (8), (9) and (16), a PMSM can be modeled as
in (17). The space-state model in (17) considers the
 stator currents and back-electromotive forces as
the state variables, while the stator currents are the
system outputs.

However, the assumption in (16) is only valid for low
speeds, due to the back-electromotive forces depend
on the mechanical speed m. In consequence, the
estimation of the back electromotive forces is inaccurate for high speeds.

This paper proposes an improvement in the estimation of the back-electromotive forces, by redefining the system to be observed. The derivatives of e

Let assume that the acceleration is small during the
operation of the PMSM (i.e., dmdt  0). Therefore,
(19) and (20) can be approximated as follows

The Luenberger observer can be applied to estimate
the state vector i i e eT (and the backelectromotive forces) in (17). If e and e are known,
equation (18) can be used to get the electrical angle

Observe that (23) is a nonlinear system in due to the
presence of the terms nm in the state matrix. In
order to solve this problem, it is possible to linearize
(23) respect to an average speed, replacing m by av.
Hence, the following space-state model is obtained

The average speed (av) is defined as the average
between the maximum and minimum steady-state
mechanical speed expected during the operation of
the motor. The space-state model in (24) is used in
the improved Luenberger observer.
3.2 Project of the Feedback Matrix through LMI
The dynamics of the proposed modified Luenberger observer also depends on (15), but using the
state matrix and output matrix in (24), which can be
defined as Ao and Co, respectively. According to
Lyapunov theory, the system in (15) is asymptotically
stable if exists a positive definite matrix Q (Q > 0)

the conventional Luenberger observer. Luenberger
estimators have some problems for low mechanical
speed. However, Fig. 2 shows that the estimation
using the proposed algorithm is more accurate.

4 Conclusion
This paper describes a modification of the Luenberger observer in order to improve the accuracy of
the angle estimation for a PMSM. Simulation results
show that the proposed estimator gives more accurate
estimations on the back electromotive forces, and it is
robust against parameter variation. As a result, the
angular position and speed can be better estimated.
As future work, the proposed Luenberger estimator
will be implemented experimentally.
