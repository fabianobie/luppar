Abstract This paper presents the development of an altitude controller for a low cost quadrotor. In this
work, an empirical tuning method of PID controllers is employed, whose great benefit is that it does not need
mathematical model. In addition, the relay method is used in the estimation of tuning parameters and there are
not any studies available in the literature about the application of this method for quadrotor altitude control.
The design methodology, which is suitable for low-cost vehicles whose modelling is difficult to obtain, is described
in the paper as well as the referred experiments. In the experiments, the following performance parameters are
evaluated on transient state for a step reference input overshoot, rise time and settling time. Furthermore, the
response of the altitude for a reference trapezoidal trajectory is evaluated. The results show that the technique
is simple and efficient for this kind of system.

Introduction

Autonomous control of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have received considerable attention
in the last decades primarily driven by an increasing commercial and military exploration of
these robots. Particularly, the quadrotor vehicles
aroused much interest because of their ability to
take off and landing vertically, great mobility, high
load capacity, simplicity and low costs compared
to other similar UAVs.
Recently, development of autonomous UAV
systems with less-human interaction have been
encouraged. Particularly, there are three levels of autonomy for UAV systems autonomous
navigation, autonomous landing, and autonomous
taking-off. For these different autonomy purposes,
different control problems and control subsystems
rise, e.g. stability, attitude_control, altitude control, and position control. Specially, the altitude control is an essential component for any autonomous UAV systems.
The quadrotor control is a challenging problem, mainly due to the fact that it is an underactuated system and its model has many nonlinear
characteristics, specially if the complex aerody-

namic effects are considered. One of the challenges
in designing these control systems is the difficulty
in obtaining a precise parametric model of these
systems. An alternative to avoid this problem is
the use of empirical techniques for control design
(e.g. Ziegler-Nichols tuning and Tyreus-Luyben
tuning) that dispenses a mathematical model.
Different strategies have been proposed to
control attitude, altitude, and position of UAVs
systems, most of them based in complex mathematical models. Among the different proposals, there may be mentioned classical PID control (Bouabdallah et al., 2004), robust control approaches (Kun and Hwang, 2016) , optimal techniques (Lai et al., 2006), adaptive_control (Alexis
et al., 2012), back-stepping (Nagaty et al., 2013),
and sliding mode (Xue et al., 2016 Xiong and
Zhang, 2016).
There is a lack of applications of empirical
tuning techniques in UAV control design, those
techniques are extensively employed in industrial
process due to their efficiency, i.e. empirical
controllers offer a reasonable performance dispensing a process model description. One of
the few works that employs empirical tuning for
UAV control is presented by (Julkananusart and

Nilkhamhang, 2015), where Fictitious Reference
Iterative Tuning is used for attitude_control of
a quadrotor system. In (Yang et al., 2013), an
adaptive self-tuning approach is used for a PID
control strategy for attitude_control of a quadrotor vehicle.
In tuning techniques like Ziegler-Nichols (ZN)
and Tyreus-Luyben (TL), is demanded some information about the systems, that might be
obtained experimentally, such as critical gain
and critical period. A well-known methodology
for auto-tuning PID controllers is the AstromHagglund method, also called relay method, presented in (Astrom and Hagglund, 1984). This
method provides an adequate estimation of these
parameters without a risk of loop instability. This
methodology is usually employed in industrial process, where the mathematical models are hardly
obtained, like in (Dandan et al., 2014).
The main objective of this research is the implementation and comparison of altitude control
strategies for a low-cost quadrotor UAV systems
without using of physical nor parametric models.
For this purpose, we proposed a empirical controller. This controller is designed with two different tuning approaches Ziegler-Nichols (ZN) and
Tyreus-Luyben (TL). The critical gain and period
demanded are obtained using the relay method.
To the best of our knowledge, the relay tuning
method was never used before for controlling UAV
systems. These strategies are implemented in a
real low-cost quadrotor and their performances
were compared.
The remainder of the article is organized as
follows Section 2 describes the UAV quadrotor
model, Section 3 explains the controller design,
Section 4 describes the experimental results, and
Section 5 presents the conclusions and describes
future research.

The model presented in Eq. 2 requires the
knowledge of physical parameters. As these parameters of the quadrotor used in this paper are
unknown, it is necessary to use empirical methods
to design the altitude controller.

Altitude controller design

The altitude structure control is illustrated in
Fig. 2. The gains of the PI controller was performed using Astrom method, depicted in Fig.
3, known as the ideal relay method (Astrom and
Hagglund, 1984). In quadrotor altitude control
we used an conditional integration anti windup
technique (Peng et al., 1996), since the control
signal saturation occurs and the integral term
tends to become large. Thus the comparator block

switches the integral input according to u and ur
signals.
The quadrotor input is a PWM signal. The
relation between ur and pwm is given by Eq. 4.
The pwmref is a PWM value for the thrust performed by the propellers is equal the weight of
quadrotor.

The experimental evaluation of the altitude
response was made considering the tuning method
of the controller, the control signal saturation and
the performance parameters for a step reference
input. The performance parameters were the percent overshoot (P.O), rise time (tr ) and settling
time (ts ) measured as (Ogata, 2010). In all tests
the reference value of the PWM signals applied to
all ESCs was 1525us and the sample time was 0.1s
for altitude reading.

the choice of 150 or 200 did not cause significant changes in the performance at low altitudes
(<2 m). Another observation is that altitude presented an oscillatory response with high overshoot
for both methods. In particular the PI controller
tuned using TL rules limited for saturation in 100
presented the best transient behaviour considering
the performance parameters evaluated.
It is emphasized that the ZN and TL methods
give a previous tuning, so the adjustments for the
gains may be required for the altitude response
meets the design specifications. Figure 10 shows
the altitude response using a P and PI controller
with changes in the gains obtained using the TL
method. Overshoot, rise time and settling time
are shown in Tab. 6. The saturation was 200 for
both controllers.

an increase in the steady state error, which does
not occur with the PI controller due to the integral
action.
Also the battery charge changes the controller
performance. As the battery charge decreases,
the overshoot for PI controller decreases and the
rise time and settling time increase for both controllers, considering that the PWM reference and
the saturation value were not changed.
The altitude response for a trapezoidal reference input is illustrated in Fig. 11. This reference
input can be used to control the quadrotor takeoff
and landing speed to a certain altitude setpoint.
The ramp slope is 10cms.
The steady state error and the rise time are
lower for the PI controller using ZN method (PIZN) with saturation at 100. However, the control
effort is greater, as shown in the graph of the control signal, so the energy consumption is higher
to maintain the performance. Also for the P controller tuning given in Tab. 6 the control effort is
smaller. On the other hand, the tracking capacity of the desired trajectory is reduced. Using the
PI controller tuning given in Tab. 6 a smoother
behaviour is obtained in the rising stage with less
control effort compared to the PI-ZN and PI-TL
controllers.

It is observed that the altitude response obtained with the P controller did not present overshoot, the settling time was below 3 seconds, and
the steady state error was less than 3. Despite
the best performance in relation to the PI controller, the P controller is more sensitive to the
battery charge. So that for lower charge there is

Conclusions

In this paper, we presented an application of the
Astrom-Hagglund relay method for auto-tuning
discrete PID gains of a quadrotor altitude control
system.
This proposal was implemented in a real lowcost UAV system and the experimental results
showed the potential of the methodology for UAV
control. Differently from majority of previous
works, our proposal dispenses a mathematical
model of the process, providing a simple and efficient solution for UAV altitude control.
Further works may include the replication of
the methodology for attitude and position control,
