Abstract For a given material resistance and magnitudes of alternate and mean stresses, the fatigue life depends essentially on
the number of applied load cycles on the tested material. For this reason, working with a materials testing machine at high frequencies brings advantages of time and cost reduction, without altering the results. To achieve such frequencies, it is necessary to
use an efficient control system. The present work shows learning control techniques developed and implemented in a materials
testing machine, allowing the application of constant or variable amplitude loads at high frequencies. The proposed methodology
consists of implementing a bang-bang type control to restrict the system servo-valve to permanently work at its extreme limits of
operation, always completely opened in either direction. As the servo-valve works at its operating limits, the learning algorithm
tries to obtain the optimal instants for the valve reversions, associating them to a non-dimensional variable, stored in a specific
table. The table values are constantly updated for the learning law during the test execution, improving the system response. The
experimental validation of this method is performed with a 100kN servo-hydraulic testing machine. A control system is especially developed to operate the machine, with real time control software implemented in a CompactRIO computational system.
The experimental results show that the test frequency can be significantly increased with the proposed learning control technique.

Resumo A vida  fadiga para uma dada resistência de material e magnitudes de cargas médias e alternadas depende essencialmente do número de ciclos de carregamentos aplicados ao material testado. Por este motivo, trabalhar com uma máquina de ensaios de fadiga a altas frequências traz a vantagem de reduzir o tempo e custo do ensaio, sem a alteração dos resultados. Para atingir tais frequências é necessário um sistema_de_controle_eficiente. O presente trabalho apresenta técnicas de controle_por_aprendizado desenvolvidas e aplicadas em máquinas de ensaios de materiais, permitindo a aplicação de carregamentos de amplitude variável ou constante a altas frequências. A metodologia proposta consiste na aplicação de um sistema_de_controle do tipo
bang-bang que restrinja a servo-válvula a trabalhar em seus limites extremos de operação. O algoritmo de aprendizado irá obter
os instantes ótimos de reversão da válvula, associando-os a variáveis adimensionais, armazenadas em uma tabela específica. Os
valores da tabela são constantemente atualizados mediante as leis de aprendizado durante o teste, melhorando a resposta do sistema. A validação experimental deste método é feita em uma máquina servo-hidráulica de ensaios com capacidade de 100 kN. O
sistema_de_controle é especialmente desenvolvido para operar a máquina, com um software_de_controle_em_tempo_real implementado em um sistema computacional CompactRIO. Os resultados experimentais mostram que a freqência dos testes pode ser significativamente aumentada com as técnicas de controle propostas.

typical fatigue test, it is necessary to have an efficient
control system.
In traditional control methods, all information
from the process is known in advance, deterministically, as described by (Doebelin, 1976). If the initial
information is unknown, a controller may be designed to estimate the information during the operation. This information could be used for future control decisions, a process known as learning control.
The literature related to the control of servohydraulic systems presents many developments applied to industrial manipulators used to perform repetitive tasks (Sun and Chiu, 1999). One of these
works is based on a Lyapunov controller, where an
adaptive law is also proposed to remove uncertainties
in the hydraulic parameters (Sirouspour and Salcudean, 2000). A second work uses a non-linear controller that presents a better performance in both

Introduction

Hydraulic systems are widely used in industrial
systems in applications such as automated plants,
robotics, motion simulators, metal processing plants,
mineral exploration, presses, heavy machinery and
materials fatigue test systems (Merritt, 1967). In general, hydraulic systems are used in applications
where relatively high forces, torques and accelerations are required. Machinery used in materials fatigue testing is based on servo-hydraulic systems, to
provide useful information about the materials life
in service by applying load cycles. The applied load
may be repeated millions of times in typical frequencies up to one hundred times per second for metals.
To achieve these relatively high frequencies in a

simulations and experiments than the results obtained
using the proportional-derivative controller (Jelali
and Kroll, 2003). Another work uses a robust controller and disturbance rejection for servo-hydraulic
systems (Ching Lu and Wen Chen, 1993). In this
case, the results of simulations and experiments show
that this controller has the ability to maintain the load
accuracy in the presence of very large variations of
the plant parameters andor external disturbances.
In the present work, a learning control technique
is developed to increase the frequency of the applied
load cycles in fatigue tests. An experimental control
system is developed and applied to a fatigue test machine in order to assess and evaluate the performance
of the proposed methodology.

when controlling a force cycle from 10 to 110kN, a
value UIJ  0.8 would be equivalent to reversing the
valve when 80 of the path between 10 and 110kN
has passed, i.e., when the measured force is equal to
10 + 0.8(11010)  90kN. In this same example,
when returning from 110 to 10kN, the same value UIJ
 0.8 would be equivalent to reversing the valve at
110  0.8(11010)  30kN.
This UIJ is a parameter that depends on several
factors such as the amplitude and mean value of the
applied load, and it is also influenced by dead zones
caused in some cases by slack in the test specimen
fixtures. The objective of the proposed approach is to
learn the values of UIJ as a function of the load amplitude, mean, and direction (either from peak to valley or from valley to peak), as described next.

2 Learning Control

2.1 Learning tables
Figure 2 shows a table that stores nondimensional numbers Ui,j (with the indexes in lowercase) associated with the learning process. These
numbers are the discrete values of UIJ for several
combinations of load amplitude and mean. The columns show the values of the gamma (or range, equal
to twice the amplitude) of the physical variable to be
controlled, while the rows show the minimum value
of the peak-valley half-cycle. Note that this table can
be divided into two parts, one associated to when the
system is going from a valley to a peak, and another
when it is going from a peak to a valley. In order to
join both tables, the concept of negative gamma is
used, which indicates the transition from a peak to a
valley.

The learning process can be seen as a problem of
estimation or successive approximations of unknown
quantities or an unknown function (King-Sun, 1970).
In this case, the unknown quantities that are estimated or learned by the controller are parameters that
are governed by the control laws.
The block diagram shown in Fig. 1 represents
the learning control process. In each cycle, the system uses the information of the variables UIJ stored
in its memory for feedback control. The errors measured during each cycle are used to update the parameters UIJ through a learning law. The learning law
is applied only at the end of each learning cycle k,
which updates the values UIJ(k) with UIJ(k+1) based
on the errors e(k). In the present application in fatigue testing, each learning cycle is associated with
each reversal of the controlled parameter, e.g., after
one peak and one valley of the applied force history.

The learning control methodology presented in
this work aims to maintain the servo-valve working
in its extreme operation limits, keeping the valve
most of the time in the fully open position in either
direction. This type of control is known as bang-bang
(O Brien, 2006). Due to the system dynamics, the
servo-valve reversion instants must be chosen to happen before the desired peaks and valleys of force or
stress.
This instant of reversion is represented by a nondimensional variable UIJ, which is defined as the
fraction of the peak-valley (or valley-peak) path
where the valve should be reversed. For instance,

As a result, Ui,j is defined as an element associated with the row i (minimum value mini) and the
column j (associated with the gamma gamaj). For a
loading with a minimum value mini and gamma
equal to gamaj, then UIJ  Ui,j. If the minimum and
gamma values are between two consecutive values in
the table, i.e., mini < min < mini+1 and gamaj < gama
< gamaj+1, then UIJ is obtained from an interpolation
(see Figure 3)

ing decreases, then x > xd, and therefore e > 0. Similarly, for an overshoot, e < 0.
As a result, positive errors are always associated
with undershoots, and negative ones with overshoots,
no matter if the transition is from a valley to a peak
or from a peak to a valley. Clearly, if an overshoot
happens, then the approach is to reverse the valve
sooner in future similar events, which implies in decreasing UIJ for that combination of (min, gamma).
On the other hand, in the case of an undershoot, it
would be necessary to increase UIJ.
Assuming that any undershoot or overshoot will
remain below 100, then 1 < e < 1, and a learning
law can be proposed

The above learning law does not need adjustable
gains. It is associated with an increment of UIJ by a
factor (1+e) in the case of an undershoot (e > 0), and
a decrease in its value for an overshoot (e < 0). It is
possible to introduce a gain to multiply the error in
equation (6), in order to tune the learning rate. Nevertheless, a unitary gain was enough in this work to
achieve a stable and fast learning law.
Since the learning table only stores discrete values of UIJ, the values Ui,j, Ui,j+1, Ui+1,j, Ui+1,j+1 that
generated UIJ(min, gamma) by interpolation must
also be updated according to the learning law, where
mini < min < mini+1 and also gamaj < gama < gamaj+1.
This update process is also made using weight factors, i.e., the neighboring cell closer to UIJ shall be
updated in a greater degree than the other three
neighbor cells. This process is easily implemented
with the learning law

where x is the valley or peak measured in the last

In the case where x and xd are peaks, x will be a
valley, and the difference (xd  x) will be positive.
Thus, if there is an undershoot in this event, then
x < xd, resulting in e > 0. Analogously, if an overshoot happens, then e < 0.
On the other hand, if x and xd are valleys, then x
will be a peak, and the difference (xd  x) will be
negative. In the case of an undershoot when the load-

Simulations of the proposed control system applied to a servo-hydraulic testing machine were performed in MATLABTM. The simulation includes the
modeling of a 100kN servo-hydraulic machine, including detailed models for the servo-valve
(Viersma, 1980 Thayer, 1965). The system model is
too lengthy to be included in this work however, its
full description can be seen in Alva (2008).
The simulations for the servo-hydraulic machine,
performed for constant and variable amplitude load
histories, show excellent results for the proposed
learning control law. Figures 4 and 5 show how the
controller learns by changing the location of the
servo-valve reversion points (represented by an x)
at each load cycle. The learning process starts assuming UIJ equal to 0.5 for any value of (min, gama).

an issue in fatigue testing, because the fatigue life of
most materials under room temperature depends only
on the load amplitude and mean, not on its frequency. These frequencies, on the other hand, are the
highest achievable for a given system and load history, since the servo-valves are always operating at
their operational limits and their reversion has been
optimized due to the learning law.

As shown in Fig. 6, the learning process also presents good results for variable amplitude histories. In
this example, three blocks with different (min, gama)
values were applied to the specimen. In the first
block, the learning process takes about 5 to 6 cycles
to converge. The second block also needs 6 blocks to
converge, because its (min, gama) is very different
from the one from the first block, updating a very
different section of the learning table. But the learning in the third block converges in only 2 cycles,
because it could benefit from the updated Uij values
learned from the second block, which had similar
(min, gama) values.

The piston from this machine can generate forces
up to 100 kN with a displacement amplitude of 50
mm (from a central position). The fatigue test machine has a force sensor (load cell) to control force
histories, and a LVDT for displacement commands.
A strain-gage or clip-gage attached to the test specimen also allows the control of a deformation history.
The hydraulic fluid is supplied by a hydraulic pump
at the pressure of 190 bar.
The learning control is implemented in a CompactRIO cRIO9004 computational system, from National Instruments. This system includes modules for
analog outputs (NI9263), analog inputs, exciter module for strain_gages (NI9237), and a voltage-tocurrent converter, see Figure 7.
The tests are run for zero mean loads and force
amplitudes of 10 kN, 20 kN, 30 kN and 40 kN, all of
them using 20mA of current in the servo-valve. The
tests are performed using N test specimens with
12mm in diameter in its thinnest section.
Figure 8 compares the performance of the proposed learning control implemented at the CompactRIO using lower 20mA currents and the traditional
one from the Instron controller hardware using
40mA, for the servo-hydraulic machine under several load amplitudes. It is possible to observe a better
performance of the learning control for low amplitudes and an equal performance for high amplitudes,
even though the learning control only needs half the
current to operate the servo-valve. The traditional
control is only able to outperform the proposed learning control when it is allowed to use currents beyond
40mA in the servo-valve (overdrive).

5. Conclusions

In this work, it was shown that it is possible to increase the work frequency of a fatigue test machine
using a learning control technique applied to servohydraulic systems. Both the bang-bang control and
proposed learning laws do not need adjustable gains,
simplifying their implementation. The proposed control system was simulated and applied to a fatigue
testing machine, implemented in a CompactRIO
computational system. The results showed that the
proposed control was capable to generate frequencies
higher than those obtained with the original controller from the testing machine manufacturer, even using lower currents for the servo-valve triggering.

It is expected that using a current of 40mA in
the proposed learning control process it will be possible to obtain even better results. Learning control
with currents beyond 40mA (overdrive) will also be
investigated in future work. The use of only 20mA
for the learning control was due to a limitation of the
voltage-to-current system of the CompactRIO.
