Abstract This paper considers the trajectory tracking control of a omnidirectional wheeled mobile robot
(OWMR) with slip and deformation in the wheels, i.e., when the kinematic constraints are not satisfied. The
dynamic of the OWMR is give in formalism with the aid of the Lagrange approach and the singular perturbations
theory. The proposed controller guarantees that the tracking error converges to small ball of the origin by choosing
small values of slip (<0.1) and by selecting appropriate parameters of an auxiliary control law. To design the
controller, it is used a integral manifold to linearize the dynamic model of the OWMR and consequently control
it. To this end, the principle of Poincare-Lindstedt is used, i.e., the manifold and the control inputs are rewrite
like a Taylor expansion. The singular perturbations theory allows to manipulate the flexibility through of a
small factor in the dynamic model (normally, known as ) at the same time that scales the dissatisfaction of the
kinematics constraints. Thus, we will observe the behavior of the tracking when the controller is applied to such
model.

Resumo Este artigo aborda o problema de controle_de_seguimento_de_trajetoria de um robo_movel omnidirecional (RMO) com deslizamento e deformacao nas rodas, ou seja, quando as restricoes cinematicas nao sao
satisfeitas. O modelo_dinamico do RMO e dado por um formalismo baseado em uma abordagem Lagrageana e de
pertur. O controlador proposto garante com que o erro de seguimento convirja a uma vizinhanca
da origem pela escolha de pequenos valores de deslizamento (<0.1) e pela selecao apropriada dos parametros em
uma lei de controle auxiliar. Para a projecao desse controlador e usado uma variedade (manifold em ingles) para
linearizar o modelo do RMO e consequentemente controla-lo. Para esse fim, o princpio de Poincare-Lindstedt
e usado, ou seja, a variedade e as entradas de controle sao reescritas como uma expansao de Taylor. A teoria
de pertur permite nao so manipular a flexibilidade atraves de um pequeno fator no modelo
dinamico (usualmente, conhecido como ), mas tambem escala a insatisfacao das restricoes cinematicas. Dessa
forma, sera observado o comportamento do controlador de seguimento_de_trajetoria proposto quando este seja
aplicado no modelo_dinamico.

Introduction

tails, see (Kolmanovsky and McClamroch, 1995)).
The tracking problem of WMRs has also been studied. The techniques for trajectory control has been
based on linearization techniques for local controlling
(Walsh et al., 1994) in techniques of nonlinear state
feedback with singular parameters (Motte and Campion, 2000 Leroquais and DAndrea-Novel, 1996)
or also in techniques based on backstepping (Jiang,
2000). A condition usually considered for trajectory
tracking problems in OWMRs is the ideal rolling assumption, i.e., the wheels are assumed to roll without
slip, or equivalently, with kinematic constraints satisfied. In principle, the slip is associated to various
effects such as deformability or flexibility of the wheels (Leroquais and DAndrea-Novel, 1996 Fernandez
et al., 2012 Fernandez and Cerqueira, 2009b Fernandez and Cerqueira, 2009a). Thus, disregarding
the slip of the wheels in the dynamic model leads
us to path tracking problems (Fernandez and Cerqueira, 2009a Motte and Campion, 2000). If the slip

The design of feedback-control laws for mechanical
systems subjected to kinematic constraints has become an area of great interest (Fernandez et al., 2013
Bazzi et al., 2014). This is the case of the stabilization and tracking problems of omnidirectional wheeled
mobile robots (OWMRs). The stabilization has been
an extensive research area in past decades due to its
challenging theoretical nature, i.e., an intrinsic nonlinear control problem and its practical importance
. It is well-known that there does not exist a smooth pure state feedback control law1 such that the
state of a wheeled mobile robot converges to the origin (Fernandez et al., 2013). In order to mitigate this
difficulty, several types of controllers have been proposed, such as time-varying control laws, discontinuous
control laws, and hybrid control laws (For more de1 Consequence of the Theorem 1, pp. 186 in Brockett
(1983).

is not taken into account, a designed task may not
be completed and a stable system may even become
unstable (Terry and Minor, 2008). In this paper, the
slip and deformation of the wheels have been considered into the dynamic model of the OWMR such that
it can be modeled by a singularly perturbed model.
We will study the trajectory tracking control of the
OWMRs subject to these two effects and aim at designing a robust controller based in a nonlinear state
feedback. To this end, with aid of the inverse dynamic a robust controller is designed to make a nonlinear
state feedback. On the other hand, by assuming that
there exists an invariant and integrable manifold for
the kinematic constraints (known as fast variables in
the singular perturbation approach), corrective control actions can be projected and added to the controller such that slip in the wheels can be mitigated
(Fernandez et al., 2012 Fernandez et al., 2013). We
apply our methodology to validate a control law with
corrective actions for the trajectory tracking problems
in the OmniBot model, an OWMR that is being constructed in the Robotics Laboratory at University Federal of Bahia for research and development of the
trajectory controllers (see Fig. 1(a)).
This paper is organized as follow in Section 2
is showed the mathematical model and the preliminaries foundations associated with inclusion of slip in
the singularly perturbed model. In Section 3 an invariant manifold for the kinematics constraints (associated with fast variables) is defined and computed
such that corrective control actions can be projected
to minimize the errors into the control scheme due to
the slip. In Section 4 the proposed approach is used
for accessing the achievable closed-loop performance.
Finally, conclusions and closing remarks are shown in
Section 5.

Controller design

same way, uk for k > 0 implies that the control law is
composed by the main control law, in this work defined by u0 , and the corrective control actions (i.e., the
terms with powers of  greater than 0 in (22)).

Like (Fernandez et al., 2013), the controller is designed
by using the singular perturbation theory. Thus, an
invariant manifold for the fast variables is introduced
and a nonlinear state feedback is imposed in order to
linearize the system.
3.1

3.2

From (25), the set of corrective controls u1 , u2 , . . . , uN
are simply designed to annihilate the set of terms
, 2 , . . . , N , respectively. That is,

Computing the invariant manifold

In order to linearize the dynamic model an invariant
manifold for the fast variables is introduced and defined by
  H (x, u , ).

u2  B3+ (q) B1 (q)H1 + B2 (q)H2

.

The purpose of this subsection is to use the manifold in (21) to make that the tracking error will converge to zero when a state feedback control law u is
applied.
By considering the principle of PoincareLindstedt, we prefer to construct the linearizing control law as well as the corresponding H assuming
these functions to be analytic. Thus, these functions
and their time derivatives can be developed under the
form of Taylor series expansion

Computing the control law u0

The control law u0  u (q, v) 0 is projected by using
the inverse dynamics of (3) and the second derivative

increases its robustness in that it increases the degree
of the Taylors expansions (22), (23) and (24). For

Choosing the value of 

Evaluating the controller

In order to verify effectiveness of the proposed controller, simulations were done by using the robust nonlinear state feedback based controller defined by (32)
and (33). However, we must first know the appropriate value for  due that Theorem 1 imposes the limit
 .

In Fig. 3(b) is shown the computational cost (measured in seconds) for the interval 109 , 5  105  in
the domain of . It can be seen that the evolution
of the computational cost increases when  increases.
Particularly, when   5105 (N  0.4 and n  5)
the system is unstable for the tracking, as shown in
Fig. 3(a). Thus, it is defined   5  105 in the
Theorem 1. Values greater than  unstabilize the
system.

Remark 4 The value of  is associated with the flexibility and deformation of the wheels, we can say that
when the value of  increases then the computational
cost of the control law (32) also increases. This is
a direct consequence of the friction coefficient, which
also increases when the deformation of the wheels increases and it is a significant cause of the dead zone in
the actuator. So, the computational effort is associated with an attempt of the control law (32) to overcome
the dead zone (Fernandez and Cerqueira, 2009b).

Dynamic model and Trajectory tracking

In Fig. 4 is shown the evolution of the vector  and
demonstrated that   0 guarantee the Condition 2.
Thus, it is possible to assert that the dynamic model
defined by (9)-(11) satisfies the approximations (19)

In this paper, the path tracking control problem of a
OWMR with slip and deformations has been considered. A robust controller based in a nonlinear state
feedback for the dynamic model of the OWMR also
has been proposed. The dynamic model was considered by using the singular perturbations theory (see
equations (9)-(11)).
In others related work OWMRs (Huang et al.,
2012 Stonier et al., 2007 Barreto et al., 2013) have
not been considered the change in the velocity vn in
the projection of the trajectory tracking controller. In
this work was considered a reference trajectory that
could explore the critical situations in which the increment of velocity vn incurs a significant increase in
the slip. The rhombus conveniently contributes to this
observation because the corners represent a sudden
change of direction and the OWMR tends to leave of
the trajectory. In this situation and due to the traction forces are linear (see (6) and (7)), the controller
has not the ability to calculate the appropriate control
action u . As a consequence of this, the controller proposed here was designed using corrective actions such
that the deviations could be reduced.
The controller was designed in two parts on the
one hand, the control law (32) designed by inverse dynamic (compare (31) and (32)) and the other hand the
auxiliary control law defined by (33). The control law
(32) was used in the dynamic model for the cases when
  0 (totally rigid) and when  6 0 (flexible). The
results observed in the Subsection 4.2 indicates that
the consideration of the flexible system is better than
the rigid system. However, the deviations observed in
the first column of Table 1 can be improved by choosing larger values for K1 and K2 (parameters that
represent a proportional and derivative adjustment)
or a larger value for N (i.e., more corrective actions).

The above approximations allow to compute the invariant manifold H into the singular perturbation approach. To observe the behavior of the control law
(32) when it is applied in the model defined by (9)(11), we can study the cases in which the model is
totally rigid (  0) and flexible ( 6 0), according to
the Remark 2. It was used one corrective action, i.e.,
N  1 in (22) and (23)

Final remarks

and
H  H0 + H1 .
In Fig. 5(a) is shown the tracking made by the
control law (35) when   4  1011 such that the
condition  <  ( 5  105 ) in the Theorem 1 is
satisfied.
The Fig. 5(a) presents the tracking of the trajectory for four different velocities 2.34 cms, 4.68
cms, 7.02 cms and 9.36 cms. For each velocity, it
can be observed that the deviation with respect to the
first corner of the rhombus is incremented with each
velocity increase. A better detailing about the deviations associated with both cases (when   0 and
 6 0) is presented in Table 1. All these deviations
were measured by taking the maximum distance with
respect to the first corner of the rhombus. It can be noted that when the velocity vn increases the deviations
are also larger (see the first column in the Table 1).
Possibly, the models of longitudinal and transversal
traction forces, represented by the equations (7) and
(6), have insufficient information to model the true
behavior of the slip, thus the controller designed will
have a greater vulnerability to reject the disturbances
produced by the slip when vn is increased.
By setting   0 the dynamic model becomes rigid. In Fig. 5(b) is shown the behavior of the tracking.
Clearly, this behavior presents greater deviations than
the case  6 0 (compare the second column in Table
1).
