Abstract This paper studies four control allocations strategies with applications to quadrotor unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs). Control allocation determines how a desired control effort is distributed among the
available system inputs. When a system has more actuators than task degrees of freedom (DoF), this problem
poses itself naturally, since there are multiple actuators choices capable of generating the same control effort.
On the other hand, if the task DoF equals the number of actuators, unless some sort of saturation occurs, the
mapping between control effort and actuators inputs is unique. This is exactly the case for quadrotor UAVs.
To countermeasure this input saturation, four control allocation strategies are presented. The first is derived
from the well known weighted least squares (WLS) criterion optimization. To obtain a more predictable control
degradation, the direct control allocation (DCA) is introduced. Then, a generalization of the DCA, called partial
control allocation (PCA) is studied. The last studied control allocation strategy is a suboptimal variation of the
PCA (S-PCA). Simulations of the last three methods are conducted and their performance is compared.

Resumo Este artigo estuda quatro estrategias de distribuicao_de_controle com aplicacoes a veculos aereos
nao-tripulados (VANTs) quadrirrotores. A distribuicao_de_controle determina como um esforco_de_controle
desejado e distribudo entre as entradas disponveis de um sistema. Quando um sistema possui mais atuadores
do que graus de liberdade (DoF) da tarefa, este problema surge naturalmente, dado que ha multiplas escolhas
de atuadores que produzem o mesmo esforco_de_controle. Em contrapartida, se a tarefa possui DoF igual a
quantidade de atuadores, a menos que ocorra saturacao, o mapeamento entre esforcos de controle e acao dos
atuadores e unico. Este e exatamente o caso para quadrirrotores. Para combater esta saturacao de entrada,
quatro estrategias de distribuicao_de_controle sao apresentadas. A primeira deriva diretamente da otimizacao do
criterio de mnimos_quadrados ponderado (WLS). Visando obter uma degradacao mais previsvel do controle, o
metodo de alocacao direta (DCA) e introduzido. Em seguida, uma generalizacao do metodo, denominada PCA e
estudada. A ultima estrategia de distribuicao estudada e uma variacao subotima do PCA (S-PCA). Simulacoes
dos ultimos tres metodos sao conduzidas e o desempenho dos algoritmos e comparado.

Introduction

Control allocation determines how to share the
control demand between the multiple actuator
systems. Since control allocation acts on a given
control input, this stage can be treated independently of the high-level motion controllers design.
This separation is advantageous because both motion control stages, i.e. high-level control and control allocation, can be improved individually and
then combined to enhance system performance.
When a system possesses multiple control inputs, the problem of control allocation appears
naturally. This happens because there are multiple actuators configurations that produce the
same control effort. This characterizes a redundant control allocation problem, as stated
by Ducard and Hua (2011), and is the case for
multirotors with more than four propellers. For
these redundant systems, there are several control allocation strategies present in the literature (Johansen and Fossen, 2013), such as linear and quadratic programming, multi-saturation
anti-windup, and model predictive control. Regarding quadrotor UAVs, most of the research
is directed towards fault tolerant systems (Marks
et al., 2012 Yoon et al., 2016), where the objec-

tive is to redistribute the demand due to the fault
or loss of one or more propulsion groups. In contrast, we study the effects of actuator saturation
on control allocation of quadrotors, and how optimization may be used to choose the best possible
control vector.
In this paper the results presented by Monteiro et al. (2016) are extended, and the pros and
cons of each control allocation strategy are discussed based on a simulated flight scenario. Assuming that saturation occurs and the prescribed
control demand cannot be met, four distinct control allocation methods are studied1 . The first
attempt aims at minimizing a weighted quadratic
criterion, reformulated as a QP problem. This reformulation could reduce computational cost and
allow real-time implementation of the algorithm,
which is desirable for embedded_systems. However, this solution does not guarantee that the
generated efforts and the desired ones point in the
same direction. To solve this issue, the direct control allocation (DCA), a method that searches for
vectors that keep the desired control direction is
studied, and a simple closed solution is found. It is
1 If one considers that allowing the motors to saturate
arbitrarily also characterizes control allocation, then there
are actually five studied strategies.

not ensure maximum attainable torque. These
points lead to the partial control allocation (PCA)
strategy, and the further development of the SPCA, a suboptimal variation of the last. Finally,
the last three strategies are evaluated in a rapid
ascent flight simulation.

Problem Formulation
2.2

Rigid Body Dynamics

Consider a quadrotor with four propellers, as
shown in Figure 1. Each propeller generates a
torque i on the body, about its z 
b axis, that
opposes the propeller rotation. The propellers

also generate forces fi on the body, along its z 
b
axis. The rotation from E to B is denoted by
R  SO(3).
The position of the quadrotor center of mass,
expressed in an inertial frame, is p  R3 . Then,
the quadrotor translational dynamics are

where m is the vehicle mass, g the gravity magnitude, and z  0 0 1T . Expressed in B, the
body angular velocity w.r.t. E is   R3 , and
it is governed by the dynamic equation

where l is the distance from the body center of
mass to the propellers, and J  R33 the body
inertia matrix.
As discussed in (Bouabdallah, 2007), since the
propellers direction of rotation does not change,
the forces and torques generated by the propulsion groups are written in terms of the propellers
velocities vi squared, such as2

control efforts. High-level control strategies are
synthesized from (6) and (7), using u as the control input, see (Bouabdallah, 2007 Mellinger and
Kumar, 2011 Mellinger et al., 2012). These controllers produce a desired control vector ud .
The inverse mapping, that produces the propeller velocities from the efforts, is

Although this matrix is invertible, the inverse
mapping might produce an unreachable velocity

Inequality (9) defines a feasible set W. Naturally, if the value obtained when ud is applied
to (8) lies inside W, the solution is trivial. Furthermore, (5) maps W into a feasible set of control
efforts U. Hence, if ud  U the solution is also
straightforward.
In general, the boundary U of the feasible
set U is obtained from W, but it may not be

Control Allocation

Quadratic Programming (QP)

Assuming the desired control vector violates (9),
it needs to be adjusted. Ideally, this choice should
follow some optimization criterion. The weighted
least squares (WLS) is a good first attempt in this
direction, as it finds u that minimizes the distance
between ud and u.
Then, consider the following WLS constrained
optimization problem to find the control u

The constrains posed by equation (11) define

propose active set algorithms, and Harkegard
(2002) propose an interior point algorithm.

Direct Control Allocation (DCA)

Instead of finding a vector that minimizes the l2
distance, a solution that is very common in flight
control applications is the direct control allocation
(DCA) (Durham, 1993). The DCA objective is to
keep the direction of the desired control vector,
while allocating a feasible control vector. For a
mapping such as (5) and (8), the following steps
describe the DCA method
1. Find   R that solves the following optimization problem
min  ud  ud 2 ,
s.t. 

ud  U
>0

(13)

2. Define the solution v  M1 ud .
Therefore, if ud  U it follows that   1
solves (13) and v  U . Otherwise, the solution
is projected onto the nearest point on U that
keeps the direction of ud . It is worth noting that
a solution to (13) may not exist. In such cases,
one might use the QP formulation (12), or one of
the techniques presented on Sections 3.3 and 3.4.
Solution 1 Given the desired motors squared velocities vd 6 U , the solution of (13), when it
exists, is

Since W is a hypercube, the proof that  from (14)
is such that vd  W and vd  vd 2 is minimum follows from simple geometry3 . From (5)
and the homeomorphism property, we have that
ud  U and ud  ud 2 is also minimum.
Remark. The DCA solution given in Solution 1
might not be valid. This fact is illustrated in Figure 3, where three different sets are compared.
The last two always admit a solution, while the
first, which corresponds to the quadrotor DCA

problem, does not. Note that even if vmin

solution might no exist depending on the required
control direction. This happens because the constraint on  is a strict inequality, cf. (13).

Partial Control Allocation (PCA)

The PCA problem (Monteiro et al., 2016) searches
for solutions u  U that preserve the direction of
some subvector of ud . For the remaining efforts,
another optimization problem is solved if needed.
The underlying motivation for choosing the
PCA is to adapt the original objective of the
DCA, that is produce a predictable degradation of forces and moments (Johansen and Fossen, 2013). Instead, one should firstly determine
to meet either one, and then optimize the other.
Choosing to partition the control vector in
ud  (ud )1 u T T ,

(15)

we fix the direction of u , define the corresponding feasible set, and solve the DCA problem for
it. From (9) it can be shown that this set U of
all attainable moments u is the dodecahedron of
Figure 4. This is effectively the projection of U
onto the hyperplane u1  0, i.e. from R4 to R3 .
Remark. For quadrotors, an important advantage of the PCA over the DCA, is that it always
admits a solution.
To solve the problem (5) is used to map the
inequalities in (9). Then, define the normalized

Suboptimal PCA (S-PCA)

Given an unattainable u , the PCA algorithm
finds the maximum attainable moments vector
that points in the same direction as u . However, the computation requires perfect knowledge
of the elements of M, which might be unavailable. To avoid this situation, the S-PCA, a suboptimal solution of the PCA algorithm, is proposed.
This solution only requires the propellers to be
balanced, and knowledge of their maximum and
minimum angular velocities. Therefore, with the
assumption that vd is given, the solution is built
without knowledge of the matrix M elements.

A high-level cascaded controller is implemented, following the PD and Backstepping used
in (Monteiro et al., 2016). The controller consists of a PD outer loop that controls the position, while the inner loop controls the attitude
of the vehicle through the Backstepping technique (Bouabdallah, 2007).
To evaluate the methods the quadrotor is required to ascend with 2g acceleration, i.e. along
ze , hold a fixed yaw angle, and describe a circle of radius 1.5m on the xy-plane. The objective
of this simulation is to force the vehicle to work
near its saturation levels. Similar situations occur when the quadrotor needs to carry a heavy

load, since this scenario also requires the motors
to produce more thrust.

Discussion

If one considers the whole simulation, the vehicle
stability is guaranteed only when the PCA strategy is used. None of the other algorithms were
capable of achieving this performance. Nonetheless, both the DCA and S-PCA, which does not
depend directly one M, maintained the stability
for a limited time. Comparing these two, the DCA
method showed a better overall performance, that
degraded only after 5 s. At this point the vehicle
had already achieved 200 m. Therefore, depending on the duration of the prescribed maneuver,
this could be satisfactory. The case depicted in
Figure 5 represents the case where no control allocation strategy is used and the propellers saturates arbitrarily. This is evidently the worst performance, and the vehicle was not able to follow
the trajectory at all.

Conclusion

This work studied four control allocation strategies, which regard control bound constraints.
These strategies were tested via simulations on a
quadrotor UAV model. The first strategy was a
reformulation of the WLS allocation as a QP problem. The motivation for this was to reduce computational cost, which favors real-time implementation on embedded_systems. Secondly, a simple
solution to the DCA method was deduced. However simple, we showed that this solution might
not exist. Then, the PCA method and its solution
were restated. Besides generating higher torques,
the solution was proved to exist for every desired
control effort. Noticing that the exact knowledge
of the matrix M elements, required for the PCA
solution, might be unavailable, we proposed the
S-PCA strategy. The solution obtained through
the S-PCA is suboptimal when compared to that
of the PCA, but it does not require this previous
knowledge.
It is worth noting that some other simulations
scenarios, with different flight conditions, favored
the DCA over the PCA strategy. This indicates
that the situations that might benefit one over the
other need further investigation.
All but the QP strategy were evaluated via
simulation. The case where no explicit control allocation strategy is employed, and therefore saturation is not managed, stressed the importance
of control allocation. Applying any of the other
methods improved the performance significantly.
The unstable response observed using the DCA
strategy might be due to its lower attainable
torque, when compared to the PCA. Therefore, a

ISSN 2525-8311

study on which flight situations result in the unsolvability of the DCA scheme is still necessary.
