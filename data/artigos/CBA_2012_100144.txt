Abstract The piezoelectric transducer is used to convert the vibration of mechanical structures into electric energy. One of the
limitations of these systems is the low quantity of power generated by the transducer. Therefore, it is mandatory to reduce the
losses at the electronic components and extract the maximum power possible from the piezoelectric to improve the performance.
In this paper bias-flip rectifier circuit and buck-boost converter are used to achieve maximum extraction power from piezoelectric transducer. The power obtained is stored in a supercapacitor and used as power supply of an autonomous temperature sensor
and a microcontroller. The use of bias-flip rectifier improves the extracted power up to 200, and the efficiency changed from
35 (full-bridge) to 72 (bias-flip).
Keywords Power harvesting, piezoelectric transducer, bias-flip rectifier.
Resumo O transdutor_piezelétrico é usado para converter vibração mecânica de estruturas em energia_elétrica. Uma limitação

1 Introduction
Power harvesting consists on converting different types of energy into electrical energy. In other
words, power harvesting is the action of capturing
and converting renewable sources into electrical energy. It can be acquired by mechanical vibration
solar energy gravitational field flow of fluids sound
pressure among others.
The main application of the power harvesting is to
supply autonomous systems that have difficulties to
access electrical energy. Using energy harvested from
environmental sources the systems that require batteries for their operation can be replenish.
Piezoelectric material transforms motion energy
into electrical energy, this energy can be stored to be
used later in electronics circuits or used in the same
time that is produced.
One of the limitations of these systems is the low
energy generated by this transducer, usually about
microwatts. This occurs mainly by the mechanical
and electrical properties of piezoelectric. This low
power output requires an electronic circuit design
with very low power consumption and with high efficiency circuit to extract the maximum power available.
Gonsalez (Gonsalez, 2010) presents a study that
considers the coupling influence between the piezoelectric transducer and the electronic circuit. This
study commends that the optimization of the load for
the system is extremity important to ensure efficiency

of the harvesting system. Leufebre (Leufebre, 2007)
used a DC-DC converter to maximize the power
flow. Several studies (Ottman,2003 Han, 2003 Kim,
2007 Tabesh, 2010) employ DC-DC converters to
improve efficiency of the systems.
Guyomar (Guyomar, 2005) investigated another
method which is to periodically remove the electric
charge stored on the internal capacitor of the transducer. With the concept of this method Ramadass
(Ramadass, 2010) presented a switch-only rectifier
and a bias-flip rectifier, these circuits have efficiency
of 200 and 400 respectively.
This paper analyzes the use of different rectifiers
in order to extract the maximum power from piezoelectric transducer and proposes a discrete low power
strategy to control the switch-only and bias-flip rectifier. Furthermore it uses the DC-DC converter to
achieve electromechanical coupling. Moreover, it is
shown an application to autonomous temperature
sensor using a low power microcontroller for signal
acquisition.
2 Piezoelectric transducer
The piezoelectric transducer is able converts mechanical energy into electrical (direct effect), and the
opposite is also true (indirect effect).
Considering a constant frequency of excitation, in
this case is the resonance frequency of structure, the
piezoelectric circuit is able to be modelled into to
electrical domain.

Figure 1. Electrical model of the piezoelectric with current
source.

According to Pearson (Pearson, 2006), piezoelectric transducer can be modeled in a simple way
with a current source in parallel with a capacitor (figure 1), where capacitor is an internal parameter of
piezoelectric transducer.
Pearson (Pearson, 2006) defines the capacitance
of the piezoelectric which depends of the electric
permittivity (0), the dielectric constant of the material (K) and the dimensions of the material. The equation of CP is

Analyzing the circuit of figure 1, it can be seen
that the load current (iout) is a difference between the
current generated by current source (ip) and the current through the capacitor (ic). Thus the load current
can be calculated by

transducer can generate. The efficiency is defined as

available power.

Rectifier circuit is used to convert alternating
current to direct current. For every half-cycle, piezoelectric current flows through internal capacitor to
either charge or discharge it. It happens because of
the internal characteristics of piezoelectric. During
this interval no current is delivered to the charge.
This fact is related in Ramadass (Ramadass, 2010).
Next it will be analyzed to full-bridge rectifier,
switch-only rectifier, and bias-flip rectifier.
3.1 Full-bridge rectifiers
Full-bridge rectifiers are the most used circuits for
this propose. The circuit is composed by diodes (D1,
D2, D3, D4) according to figure 2, the variable Vp is
positive voltage of the piezoelectric and Vn
negative voltage of the piezoelectric. The maximum
rectified voltage is equal to peak of the voltage
generated by the piezoelectric reduced in two voltage
drops from diodes. In this work, to reduce energy lost
due the voltage drop are used Schottky diodes
(voltage drop of 0.4V).
At the beginning of positive half cycle the internal
capacitor is negatively charged. Then piezoelectric
current flows to discharge it. This condition continues until the voltage across the capacitor becomes
positive, at moment all diodes are reversed biased
and no current flows to load. Once, capacitor is already charged, the current flows through diodes D1 e
D4 and the load.
At the negative half cycle the piezoelectric current inverts direction, now it flows through the internal capacitor discharging it and then charging it negatively. During this down-slope all diodes are reversed
biased. Once, capacitor is already charged negatively,
current flows through diodes D2 e D3 and the load.
This process repeats periodically.
The main limitation of the full-bridge rectifier is
that a significant part of the current does not flow
through the load. This occurs due to charge and discharge of the internal capacitor. This fact limits the

the inductor will be responsible for discharged and

available to the piezoelectric will be used at load and
the piezoelectric power extracted will be greater.

maximum power that can be extracted from the piezoelectric transducer. The switch-only rectifier and
bias-flip rectifier are introduced to overcome this
limitation.

3.2 Switch-only rectifier
Switch-only rectifier is composed by an analog
switch connected between piezoelectric and fullbridge rectifier, as shown figure 3. The switch will be
turned on for a brief time whenever the piezoelectric
current cross zero.
When the switch turns on, the internal capacitor is
then grounded and discharged. Once the capacitor
has been discharged the switch turns off and the
piezoelectric current flows to charge the capacitor.
After, the current flows through diodes, according to
the half-cycle, and the load. This process is repeated.
In this circuit the piezoelectric current must charge
only the internal capacitor, thus the current flows
through the load. Thus, the current is more useful at
load and has lower loss.
3.3Bias-flip rectifier
Bias-flip rectifier, also known as synchronous switch
harvesting on inductor (SSHI), it is similar to the
switch-only rectifier, but is added an inductor in
series with the switch, as shown in figure 4. The
purpose of the inductor is to invert the polarity of the
internal capacitor.
When the switch turns on, the internal capacitor is
then discharged and charged. Once the capacitor has
been charged the switch turns off and the
piezoelectric current flows to diodes and the load,
according of the half-cycle, and the load. This
process is repeated.
Ideally, in this circuit the current of the
piezoelectric will not be lost in the internal capacitor,

The power generated by piezoelectric transducer
depends on the load connected. Gonsalez (Gonsalez,
2010) shows that to obtain the maximum power there
is an optimal impedance, its value is determined by
the characteristics and the vibration frequency of
piezoelectric transducer. DC-DC converter is used to
match optimal impedance. In this paper it was used
buck-boost converter.
The buck-boost converter, figure 6, is used to
control power flow between the load and source. The
converter is controlled by MOSFET transistor.
In this work the converter will operation in
discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), considering
that in this mode the buck-boost can be controlled to
have a behavior similar as resistor. The value of the
equivalent resistor is defined according to the
equation below (Leufebre, 2007).

However the switch-only and bias-flip circuit has a
disadvantage, they require a circuit to control the
switch. It should be pointed that the circuit will not
be connected to an external source. This means that
the system must consume less power than the
generated by the transducer. The control technique
should be as simple as possible. Considering this, the
circuit control was projected with low power
consumption components.
The switch needs to be turned on every the
piezoelectric current cross by zero. At this point the
voltage at the piezoelectric is maximum (either
positive or negative) and then begins to decrease.
The polarity of the piezoelectric current is detected
by differentiator circuits from the voltage from the
piezoelectric (Vp and Vn). A discrete control circuit
was projected, as shown figure 5. It is composed by
differentiator circuits, and comparators. The
comparators are used in order to adjust the voltage
phase with the zero-crossing of the piezoelectric
current and determine the width of the control signal.

4 Application to Autonomous Sensor
In some application the sensor is located in difficult access area, so the measure should be transmitted
to be analyzed by radio transceiver or can be stored
in memory to posterior send.
This process has power consumption so a battery
or any other power supply is needed. This is a concern because the battery replacement is difficult.
This paper proposes one alternative to avoid the
battery usage, which uses a low power microcontroller to realize the acquisition and stores it in EEPROM
memory for latter transmission via serial communication. The power supply for the data acquisition will
be the supercapacitor charged by the piezoelectric
transducer.
The temperature sensor and the microcontroller used
were MCP9700 and PIC24F16KA101. The microcontroller captures the measure of the sensor by the
converter AD every ten minutes by RTCC (Real
timer clock and calendar) alarm. The time and the

measure are written in internal EEPROM memory.
The software flowchart is shown in figure. 7.
The mode deep sleep brings the device into its
lowest power consumption. So the microcontroller
stays in this mode, except when the RTCC alarm occurs and the INT0 activated by button S. The serial
communication is enabled when the button S is
pressed. In this stage the deep sleep and the RTCC
alarm are disabled until all the data are sent.

5 Experimental Setup

The piezobeam was excited by shaker, model
11077 ELN 138 of the Veb Robotron Messelektronik. The frequency and amplitude of voltage of
the piezoelectric were controlled by using a function
generator and an amplifier connected to the shaker.
The Piezoelectric was excited in transverse mode of
operation by sine function generated by function generation Minipa MFP-4220 20 MHz and high-power
current amplifier Veb Metra Mess LV 103. The frequency used is resonance frequency, 168.1 Hz. The
peak of voltage in open circuit was 4 V. The output
signal from the transducer was monitored using an
oscilloscope and a multimeter. The piezoelectric
transducer used is PSI-5H4E. The dimensions of the
piezoelectric and the beam are shown on table 1.

circuit consumes less than 35 W, the supercapacitor
can supply this power without prejudice to the load.
The converter is composed by MOSFET transistor
IRFZ44N, 10 F tantalum capacitor and Schottky
diode 1n5817. The control is done with low power
crystal oscillator 32 kHz (SMD EM-7604-C7). The
oscillator current consumptions is 300 nA, and has a
fixed duty cycle of 50. The value of inductor is
defined through eq. 6, and is 30 mH.
When the supercapacitor is already charged with
3.0V, the temperature sensor and microcontroller will
be connecting to the extraction power system. The
sensor will be used to test the software and check the
supply power of the supercapacitor for the microcontroller.

The proposed circuit is shown in figure. 8. The
full-bridge rectifier is composed by four Schottky
diodes 1n5817, a 10 uF tantalum capacitor and a variable resistor. For the switch-only and the bias-flip
rectifier, besides the components used to full-bridge
rectifier, the circuit is composed by 10 nF, 10 nF
and 20 nF ceramic capacitor (respectively C1, C2 and
C3) and 40 k, 100 k, 20 k and 2 k (respectively R1, R2, R3 and R4). Two CI quad comparators
6544 are used. The Vref1 and Vref2 of the circuit control are obtained from voltage divider (1 M and 800
k for Vref1 1 M and 200 k for Vref2). The analog

6 Experimental Results and Discussion
The waveforms for the voltage provided by piezoelectric to the different rectifier circuits with load
resistance 20 k are shown in figure 9.
Figure 10 shows the voltage provided by the piezoelectric as a function of load resistance. In this
figure, it could be observed that when value of the
load resistance is small (close to short circuit) the
voltage of the piezoelectric is small, close to zero,
and when value of the load resistance is great the
voltage of the piezoelectric is like an open circuit (no
circuit connected). In figure 11 the extracted power is
presented as a function of load resistance. According

Resistance (k)

to the results presented in this figure for value small
and great of the load resistance the power is low.
However, maximum power is obtained with load resistance in the 8 k to 30 k range.
In the full-bridge rectifier the highest power extracted was 196.36 W with load of 18 k, the average current in piezoelectric is 173.50 A, the peak
voltage in the piezoelectric is 1.32 V and the rectified
voltage on the load of about 1.88 V (this drop of
0.5V tension is due to the Schottky diode), and the
efficiency is 35. For the switch-only rectifier the
highest power extracted was 299.02 W with load of
18 k, the average current in piezoelectric is 205.00
A, the peak voltage available from the piezoelectric
is 2.76 V, the output voltage is 2.32 V and the efficiency is 54. With The bias-flip rectifier the higher
power extracted was 400.45 W with load of 20 k,
the average current in piezoelectric is 223.00 A, the
peak voltage available from the piezoelectric is 3.28
V, the output voltage is 2.83 V and the efficiency is
72.
A comparison based on the topologies of the rectifier circuit shows that the bias-flip rectifier circuit has
the best performance. The bias-flip rectifier circuit
provided a higher voltage and extracted more power
from the piezoelectric.
Figure 12 shows the power of the piezoelectric as
a function of load resistance connected to bias-flip
rectifier with buck-boost converter. In table 2 are
shown the tension provided by the piezoelectric, the
power of the piezoelectric and the maximum power
extracted for each circuit. In all cases which use the
buck-boost converter the tension of the piezoelectric
transducer remained in according with the equivalent
resistance. The DC-DC converter is emulating the
optimum charge and can be used to extract the maximum power from the piezoelectric.
The microcontroller worked as expected. The
measure in the first twenty-four hours is shown in
figure 13. The power consumed by sensor and microcontroller is 300 nW. The supercapacitor still receives charge of the transducer even connected with
the microcontroller. The initial voltage of the supercapacitor was 2.70 V and after 24 hours was 3.34 V.
So the system is able to supply power for the temperature sensor.

The performance evaluation of an energy harvesting circuit presented here until the moment is done
comparing the circuit with the standard full-bridge
rectifier. However, these improvement rates cant be
compared between different power harvesting systems. Therefore Tabesh (Tabesh, 2009) defines some
criteria to evaluate the power harvesting systems, as
efficiency, stand-alone operation, circuit complexity
and adaptivity. In table 3 is shown compared with
power harvesting systems using the criteria defined
by Tabesh.
The features of the circuits in table 3 show that the
proposed circuit in this paper exhibits characteristics
essential to use in power harvesting, has low consume and acceptable efficiency, further operates with
range of power smaller than most of the circuits
(larger only the circuit implemented in microelectronics).

The purpose of this paper is to extract the maximum power from piezoelectric transducer and store
this power in a supercapacitor to be used later in
electronic circuits. In the proposed circuit the power
improvement up to 200 in relation of the fullbridge rectifier and the efficiency increases from 35
(full-bridge) to 72 (bias-flip). The circuits of control used to bias-flip rectifier and buck-boost converter consume lower power than the produced by
transducer piezoelectric. So these circuits are able to
maximize the power extracted from transducer piezoelectric. The results show that the power extracted
from piezoelectric transducer by power extraction
system, was able to charge a supercapacitor, and was
able to supply the power autonomous sensor system.
