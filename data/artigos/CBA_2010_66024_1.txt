Abstract - A fuzzy decision model to solve the problem of location and size of shunt capacitors for unbalanced distribution
system with harmonic sources is presented. The problem is formulated as a fuzzy dynamic programming problem of the
minimization of three-phase power loss and capacitor cost under the constraints of voltage limits and total voltage harmonic
distortion per phase. So much the function objective as the constraints sets of the overall problem are modeled by fuzzy sets based
on knowledge of planer about system and whose membership functions values are obtained from the results of three-phase
harmonic load flow analysis. The harmonic load flow modeling can takes into account the skin effect of conductors at higher
frequencies, coupling mutual between phases and the presence of multiple and different harmonic sources.

sizing of the capacitors on network. In this sense, we
used a routine of three-phase harmonic load flow to
evaluate the system operational state included in a
decision model based in the fuzzy set theory. This
approach intends to incorporate to the problem the
characteristic of inherent uncertainty to whole the
process of decision centered in the judgment human,
that is, the choice of a satisfactory solution in
agreement with conflicts criterions.
The proposed decision model obtains a solution
that satisfies the engagement between the
minimization of the power losses (objective) and two
operational constraint sets voltage regulation and
voltage harmonic distortion. For so much, the
minimization of the objective and the attendance of
the two restrictions are relaxed, considering the
opinions of the planner, which are modeled by fuzzy
sets. A fuzzy dynamic programming was developed
to yield the adequate locations by considering the
effect of the reactive power source to the voltage
variation, three-phase power losses and voltage
harmonic distortion. The proper size of shunt
capacitors to be installed at each feasible location is
solved by simple heuristic routine whose steps are
based on the method of local variations proposed in
Baghzouz (1990).

1 Introduction
Most of the methods to obtain the shunt capacitor
placement consider the power system operated at
fundamental frequency only, because its just
designed for the linear portion of electric loads Chiang (1990), Duran (1968), Ertem (1987),
Grainger (1981), Kaplan (1984) - and the effects of
nonlinear portion are completely ignored.
In practice, a portion of electric load is nonlinear
due to the widespread use of energy-efficient
fluorescent lamps and solid-state devices in most
electrical home appliances and office equipment.
These nonlinear loads introduce current and voltage
harmonics into the electrical network and harmonic
frequencies in the power grid are a frequent cause of
power quality problems.
One of the major effects of power system
harmonics is to increase the current in the system.
This is particularly the case for the third harmonic,
which causes a sharp increase in the zero sequence
current, and therefore increases the current in the
neutral conductor.
The methodology proposed in this paper for the
reactive compensation in distribution systems will
provide planning strategies which satisfies security,
save and energy quality criterions, gets subsidies for
the decision of the planners about the location and

systems.

voltages per phase are known, the total peak power
losses inclunding harmonic frequencies, is expressed
by

2 Problem Description and Formulation
In the harmonic load flow model, the loads are
classified as either linear (passive loads) or nonlinear
(any harmonic source). In determining harmonic
voltages caused by nonlinear loads, a three-phase
network model takes account the unbalanced loads,
the mutual coupling effect of conductors and the
effect skin on conductors. The current injection
method based on admittance matrix presented in
Chen (1989) was reformulated to evaluate the
harmonic voltages profile at each bus system on
three-phase basis. It is assumed that the entire
distribution system is modeled as a combination of
passive elements (branch and load impedances)
represented by its impedance matrix and harmonic
current sources. Therefore, the principle of
superposition may be applied to enable each
harmonic to be considered independently. Because
the elements have different admittance values for
each harmonic order, is necessary to modify the
admittance matrix for each harmonic order of
frequency to be studied.
If skin effect on conductors is considered at
higher frequencies, the resulting h-th harmonic
frequency load admittance, shunt capacitor
admittances and branches admittances are
respectively given by

In this paper, the objective of placing shunt
capacitors along distribution feeders is to reduce the

limits, while the cost of capacitors into account.
Being like this, the total annual cost function due to

The Fuzzy Method

If all possible combinations of the capacitors
locations and sizes are considered, it will become a
very exhaustive search problem. To reduce the efforts
to find the adequate solution, the capacitor placement
problem was solved based on fuzzy sets decision
methodology. The inherent uncertainty to the solution
of the problem is owed exclusively to the element
human decider, that is to say, the application of a
model based on fuzzy sets is inserted on the stage of
the problem related to the process of decision.
In this proposed approach, a fuzzy objective

function characterized by the fuzzy set P related to
three-phase power losses is used. The constraints sets
imposed on the system are divided into two groups.
The bus voltage limits per phase and the total voltage
harmonic distortion factor per phase are treated as
fuzzy constraints since they are related to the
imprecise (fuzzy) load profiles. The other constraints
- maximum allowable capacitor size to be placed at
any feeder location - are considered to be crisp
values. The possible voltages, losses and distortion
harmonics states are crisp state variables. Therefore,
the fuzzy decision model contains a fuzzy objective


function P and two fuzzy sets constraints Vi (bus

(the bus i harmonic distortion factor at phase  is
satisfied)

(the resultant capacitor placement is desirable)
(15)

3.1 Membership function for the fuzzy objective
Since our purpose is to get a reactive
compensation with minimum cost, we can reduce the
total branch i loss by defining a membership function
for the three-phase power loss such that a high loss
branch is given a low membership value. A good
fuzzy decision is then defined to be one that with a
high membership value. Therefore, the membership
function adopted for the three-phase power loss is

voltage) and H i (voltage harmonic distortion factor)
and the fuzzy decision (adequate placement) must
take both the objective function and two constraints
sets into account. In fuzzy set notations, the fuzzy set

decision D is the confluence (intersection) of the

objective function P and the per phase constraints

3.2 Membership function for voltage deviation


Vi

Let us consider i as a possible candidate bus for
capacitor location that the minimum voltage limit is
violate. Vmin (Vmax) is the minimum (maximum)
voltage acceptable in phase  of bus i. With these two
values we can define the membership function for




sets Vi and H i .

Vi such that the bus with high

voltage deviation per phase is given a low
membership value. Consequently, a good fuzzy
decision is then defined to be one those with a high
membership value. Therefore, the membership
function chosen to represent voltage deviation per
phase constraints is

In this approach, the possible locations to install
capacitors are selected after harmonic load flow
solution for those buses that violates the rms voltages
and harmonic distortion limits. At each stage of
network (initial or after partial compensation), such
buses are denominated candidates buses. To
selection of number of capacitors units at each
candidate bus, we consider a minimum standard size
that is commercially available and the maximum
reactive power at referred buses.
It should be observed in (14) that fuzzy sets
operations could only be achieved through
membership functions of the fuzzy sets. Thus, to

3.3 Membership function for constraint voltage

find the capacitor size that will provide minimum
annual losses cost.
The computational algorithm for the fuzzy
programming model corresponds to the following
steps
Step 1. Perform the three-phase harmonic load flow
to calculate the bus voltage rms per phase and
total power losses.
Step 2. Identify the bus with voltage violations
(candidates buses) and calculate the membership

Another constraint is the minimum voltage
harmonic distortion in each phase after capacitors
placement. If Ni is the percent of nonlinear load of
bus i at phase , and HDFmax is maximum limit of
harmonic distortion factor per phase, we can to
reduce the total voltage harmonic distortion by

defining a membership function for H  such that a
bus i with high voltage harmonic distortion per phase
is given a low membership function value and the bus
i with a low voltage harmonic distortion per phase is
given a high value. The membership function chosen
is defined by (18).

Step 4. Try the capacitor placement at bus i with
various discrete sizes of minimum standard size.
Choose the size Qc, which will result in the lowest
cost function without violating the rms voltage
and harmonic distortion constraints in three
phases.
Step 5. Install Qc at bus i and simulate again the
harmonic load flow to calculate if there is new
bus voltage violation. If still exists, return to step
2 else stop.

In order to evaluate the proposed fuzzy model for
the adequate placement of shunt capacitors at systems
with distorted voltages and currents, a realistic 21kV
radial distribution system - Pereira (1996) - with
thirty-two buses, thirty-two branches and three
harmonic sources of the type six-pulse convert is
used. The one-line diagram of this system is shown in
Figure 2.

buses on which the capacitors could be installed is,
i.e., its the candidate buses. The cost function and
total three-phase power losses are 116640 and 259.2
kW respectively.
The least rms voltage is 0.9434pu at phase A of
bus 31, and the maximum harmonic distortion is
4.77 at bus 21.
Applying the membership functions for the
candidate buses, with kl 10, kv10 and kh10, an
solution for the adequate capacitor locations, which
gives minimum cost power losses, without violates
voltage constraints, was achieved by the fuzzy
decision model. The results for the fuzzy decision at
each test bus are presented in the Table 2.
Bus 24 was selected to be the location of the
shunt capacitor due to the smallest fuzzy decision
value among candidates buses. (D24  0.4207).
The size of the capacitor at bus 24 is then obtained by
the method of local variations. The solution obtained
is that the lowest cost without violates the rms
voltages and harmonic distortion will be achieved if a
capacitor of 3000 kVAr is installed at this location.
Figure 4 shows the variation of harmonic distortion
with the capacitor units added on bus 24 until to
reach the adequate size.

The data and characteristics of the three harmonic
sources located on buses 21, 22 and 24 are shown in

The per-phase total power load is
Phase a 17806.3 kW + j 7009.1 kVAr
Phase b 12735.5 kW + j 7027.1 kVAr
Phase c 12716.9 kW + j 7154.6 kVAr
This load profile corresponds to highest load level
on which we established the maximum capacitor
reactive power to be installed per phase.
A real power loss cost of 450kW was used and
the unit cost of three-phase capacitor commercially
available is chosen in agreement with representation
of Figure 3.
With these data and the initial configuration
network shown in Figure 2 (non-compensated
system), a harmonic load flow analysis is realized.

Figure 4  Harmonic distortion vs capacitor size at
bus 24
This procedure is repeated until all the voltage
violates are completely solved. For this particular
system, the solution of the reactive compensation
problem was bus 24 and bus 31 with the
corresponding reactive compensation per phase 3000
kVAr and 300 kVAr.
Table 3 shows the resultant system voltage profile
and the total_harmonic_distortion. These results show
that a better rms voltage profile, lower power losses
and less harmonic distortion have been obtained by
proposed fuzzy decision model.

Figure 3 - Cost of three-phase capacitors
We considered Vmin  0.958 pu phase, Vmax 
1.05 pu phase and the maximum harmonic distortion
factor permissible is HDFmax  4 phase.
With these data and the initial configuration
network shown in Figure 2 (non-compensated
system), a harmonic load flow analysis is realized.
The results are resumed at Table 2. In agreement
with the set constraints imposed to problem, it was
observed that buses 15,16,..,20,23,24,25,...,32 have
a voltage violation problem. Therefore, this is the set

that by shunt capacitors strategically located and
sized, its possible to control generation of
harmonics.
iii) When limits on the total_harmonic_distortion are
ignored, the cost function found by neglecting
harmonic frequencies is 9735 higher than that
of case in which harmonic components are
taken into account. This is due to the fact that
harmonic frequencies naturally increase the rms
voltages. Thus, less KVAR are needed to bring
the voltage levels up to the minimum
permissible level.
iv) To maintain a limit of harmonic distortion
below 4 the investment in capacitors it should
be larger and consequently the new solution is
less economical.
v) Depending of the coefficients values kl, kv and
kh for membership functions, the adequate
location and size of capacitors can to change.
The decrease of coefficient kh from 10 to 0.1 it
facilitated that the decision criterion for chosen
the adequate bus has been of tension deviation.
In this case, an only one capacitor is necessary
for the reactive compensation and the solution is
less economical than original case.
The saving with reduction of losses, that is
9360,0 in this example, shows that the fuzzy
decision based on intersection of membership
functions is enough of this type of application.

Sensibility Analysis

It is obvious from formulation that the reactive
compensation depends on limits of harmonic total
distortion and voltages well as on forms of
membership functions of losses, voltage deviation
and harmonic distortion, which have been chosen
somewhat arbitrarily. The aim of this section is to
show the effect of harmonic distortion limit and
different forms of membership functions on final
results.

3.1 Sensibility to Harmonic Distortion Limits
In addition to the value of 5 more two cases
were imposed on the total_harmonic_distortion i)
HDFmax  4 and ii) constraint of HDFmax ignored.
Table 4 shows the total cost and corresponding
capacitor size and location for each of these cases
under investigation. The power losses, minimum and
maximum rms voltages, and maximum total harmonic
distortion are also shown in same table.

3.2 Sensibility to Membership Functions
To see how different forms of membership
functions affect the solution, was simulated a case in
which kl  0.5 kv  1.0 and kh  0.1. With these
parameters, the corresponding membership functions
have larger values than the original case. The results
are showed in Table 5 together with the results of the
original solution for comparison.
By analyzing the results from Tables 2, 3, 4 and
5, the following conclusions are derived
i)
The decisive factor in the choice of the bar 24
as the adequate bus, among the selected
candidate buses, it is the largest percent of
existent nonlinear load in this bar providing
smaller membership function value of H than
P and V.
ii) The resultant rms voltage and total harmonic
distortion profiles presented in Table 3 confirms

7 Conclusions
In this paper, a fuzzy decision model has been
developed to determine the adequate location of
compensation shunt capacitor for the unbalanced
distribution systems with harmonic current sources.
For take the uncertainties or imprecision in profile
load, fundamental and harmonics voltages,
membership functions are derived for three-phase
losses, rms deviation voltage and harmonic distortion
factor at each phase using fuzzy set notations. With

The property of convexity of the three
membership functions guaranties the application of
the property of intersection among those functions as
basis of fuzzy decision model.

these membership functions, a fuzzy decision model
is defined to get the bus location under the fuzzy
dynamic programming environment. The form of
membership functions defined for objective and
constraints can be easily adapted in agreement with
the decision-maker needs providing more flexibility
to the decision model. Another very important feature
of the proposed fuzzy approach is a more realistic
modeling of three performance indices losses,
deviation voltage and harmonic distortion factor,
which are treated on three-phase basis. Furthermore,
the skin effect of resistance of conductors and cables
at higher frequencies can be taking into account in
the harmonic load flow solution. A simple heuristic
algorithm that is based on the method of local
variations is incorporated to fuzzy programming to
find the capacitor size at each adequate location.
A thirty-two unbalanced radial distribution system
with three harmonic sources of type six-pulse convert
is chosen to exemplify, via numerical results, the
validity of the proposed fuzzy decision model. The
solution, which consists in find the adequate location
for shunt capacitors, is found using the property of
intersection of fuzzy sets. For each phase of radial
network are defined membership functions for
deviation voltage and total_harmonic_distortion that
represent the constraints set problem. Another
membership function is defined to represent the total
power losses including the harmonic components. A
three-phase harmonic load flow program based on
admittance matrix method was used for obtain the
state of network in all stages of fuzzy programming
which results are used for calculates the membership
functions. The local variation method was used for to
determine the capacitor size at each adequate location
by fuzzy decision model. As result, the buses location
and the capacitor size of 300 kVAr that provided
better saving with loss reduction without violates the
rms voltage and harmonic distortion profiles is found
for the test network.
The validity of the fuzzy decision criterion for
adequate location of shunt capacitors can be clearly
observed comparing the results of rms voltage and
harmonic distortion of Tables 2 and 3 further general
results of losses and cost function presented in the
second column of the Table 3. Note that only 8 of
loss reduction provided a saving of 9360 in
investment that could be used to buy others
equipments as regulators and filters. The economic
benefits depend on the maximum total harmonic
distortion allowed and it was proven that the solution
may not be economical if strict regulations on
waveforms distortion levels are applied.
Its fundamental to take into account the constraint
of harmonic distortion in the reactive compensation
problem in distribution systems with nonlinear loads
because in this case the installation of shunt
capacitors to improve the voltage profile provided
serious problems of parallel resonance in agreement
the results shown in fourth column at Table 4.
