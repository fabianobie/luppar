Introduction

In offshore environment, surface vessels are
submitted to heave movement (vertical displacements) due to sea waves. In order to reduce the
displacement transferred from the vessel to the
equipments, a heave compensator is commonly
used.
In drilling industries, for instance, the heave
displacement of the drill string can generate load
variations on the drill bit, swabbing, and buckling of the drill string. Consequently, these problems can collapse the borehole wall, generate well
kick and damage the drill bit and the drill string.
When the compensator is not able to compensate
the heave, the drilling process is halted to avoid
the risk of accidents. Stopping the drilling process
is equivalent to loss of operation time and money.
Many heave compensators have been proposed in literature. (Hatleskog and Dunnigan,
2007) proposes an active heave compensation system used in conjunction with a passive compensator. The objective is to reduce the heave disturbance at the suspended load above sea floor.
In this case, the compensator system behavior is
described by a second order differential equation.
In another work, (Do and Pan, 2008) outlines
an active heave compensator with a double acting
cylinder. The cylinder is operated in such a way
that it applies force to the crown block to overcome frictions and the force acting between the

ISSN 2525-8311

riser and the active heave compensation unit to
maintain a constant distance from the upper end
of the riser to the seabed.
More recently, (Woodacre et al., 2015) provides a review of vertical heave motion compensation systems used on ocean vessels and suggests
that more experimental work should be carried
out on real-world systems to experimentally validate the active heave compensation controllers being designed and simulated in literature.
In this paper, a flatness-based control approach for an active heave compensator actuated
by a double acting cylinder is proposed. The
governing equation is a second order differential
equation, which describes the dynamic of the suspended mass. The final model is equivalent to
a base excited system. The force transmitted to
the sprung mass by the vessels movement is interpreted as a external disturbance, which is estimated by using the Kalman filter recursion as
disturbance observer, in addition to state estimation.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2
presents the mathematical system modeling. Section 3 presents concepts of differential flatness
theory and describes the propose control strategy. Numerical simulations results using MatlabSimulik are presented in Section 4. Lastly,
are drawn conclusions and suggestions for further
research in Section 5.

System Modeling

In this section, a system model similar to the
one presented in (Hatleskog and Dunnigan, 2007)
is described.
Figure 1 shows the schematic illustration of
the system, where X1 is the sprung mass coordinate, x0 is the vessel position, k is the stiffness
coefficient and c the damping coefficient between
the vessel and the sprung mass m. Therefore this
is a one degree of freedom system.

where Fp corresponds an additive disturbance
force due to the vessel displacement, and is given
by
Fp  kx0 + cx0 .
(3)
Basically, the control goal is to formulate a
state-feedback control law in order to mitigate and
compensate disturbances effects. For this purpose, next section presents the control strategy
used.

Trajectory Tracking Control Design

Commonly found in mobile robotics applications, the flatness property was proposed and
developed by (Fliess et al., 1992). A system
x  F (x, u) with states x  Rn and inputs u 
Rm , with n > m, is considered differentially flat if
is possible to find outputs z  Rm as below
z  z (x, u, u,    , u(q) ),

Figure 1 Schematic illustration of the controlled
system and the actuator.
The actuators dynamics, such as saturation
and coulomb friction, are not considered in system modeling. It means that, the actuator is able
to provide the exact control command required.
Moreover, the vessel dynamic in relation to the
ocean is not modelled because the active heave
compensation system should work for any disturbance, i.e., the active heave compensation system
ought to be independent of the vessel movement
from ocean waves.
The displacement x1 can be measured via an
inertial measurement unit (IMU), like accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers and combinations of these instruments.
As explained by (Kuchler et al., 2011), between the measurement and the control input
there is a delay, which is neglected in this paper. Equation (1) presents the forces acting in
the sprung mass m.
mx1  kx1  cx1 + kx0 + cx0 + U,

(1)

where x1 is the sprung mass velocity, x1 is the
sprung mass acceleration, x0 is the vessel velocity
and U is the control command.
Equation (1) then can be rewritten into a
state-space representation using the states variables x1 and x2 , as shown in (2).

where z represents the flat outputs of the system
and q is a finite number.
Thus, the state and input expressions are represented as follows
x  x (z, z,    , z (q) ),
u  u (z, z,    , z

(q+1)

(5)
),

(6)

where z , x and u are smooth vector functions
and all the components are differentially independents (Fliess et al., 1995).
In order words, a differentially flat system is
the one whose system variables can be expressed
as a function of these flat outputs and its time
derivatives, without the need to solve the integration operation. Moreover, all dynamical systems
which satisfy differential flatness properties can be
transformed through a change of variables (diffeomorphism) into controllable linear system on
Brunovskys canonical form, whose the flat outputs constitute the state vector (Martin, 2002).
Since creates a local bijection between system state solution and arbitrary trajectories in the
flat output space, this differential parametrization plays a key role both in motion planning
and in trajectory tracking problems (Sira-Ramrez
and Agrawal, 2004). For example, knowing the
nominal trajectory z  (t), one can compute x (t)
and u (t) without solving differential equations by
means of (5) and (6), respectively. Thus, flatness
allows, in an off-line manner, to check and adjust
the desired behavior of system variables with relative ease.
In the followings subsections, first, we exploit the flatness property of the disturbancefree model of (2) to design a feedback control
law during trajectory tracking. Thus, assuming
the disturbance term affecting the Brunovskys
canonical form, we simultaneous estimate the nonmeasurable elements of the system state vector as

well as the additive disturbance terms with the
use of a Kalman filter-based disturbance estimator described in (Rigatos, 2015).

Then, to compensate for the effects of the disturbance force it suffices to modify the control input (12) that is applied to (9) by

where R is the measurement noise covariance matrix and Q is the process noise covariance matrix.
Therefore, we assume that the measured variable
x1 is affected by an additive white Gaussian noise
with variance equal to 0.0001 (standard deviation
  0.01 m).
The controller gains were chosen as the coefficients of a Hurwitzs polynomial characterized
by having two roots equal to 1.5  1.5i. These
gains provide a reasonable attenuation rate as also
an acceptable control signal.
The first simulation results show how the controlled system responds to a periodic disturbance
of low frequency. The disturbance used is a composition of two harmonic functions

The second simulation uses an random disturbance taken from (Ni et al., 2009). Figures 5-7 do
the same analysis that was done for Figures 2-4,
respectively, but now for a random disturbance,
which has in its composition high frequencies.
The attenuation obtained for the random disturbance is 85.4. It is an acceptable result
once (Cuellar and Fortaleza, 2015) obtains 75
and (Ni et al., 2009) obtains 83.17 of attenuation. It is important to be aware that (Cuellar
and Fortaleza, 2015) proposes a semi-active control and (Ni et al., 2009) proposes a passive control. (Hatleskog and Dunnigan, 2007) suggests
that the maximum attenuation for an active heave
compensator is around 95.

Conclusions

In this paper, a flatness-based control approach for an active heave compensator actuated
by a double acting cylinder was proposed. Estimation of disturbance terms affecting the system has
been performed with the use of a Kalman filter.
First, it was proven that the dynamic model
of the active heave compensator is a differentially
flat one, and this enabled its description in the
Brunovsky canonical form. For this equivalent
system, it has been shown that it is possible to design a state feedback controller. At a second stage,
by redesigning the Kalman Filter in the form of a
disturbance observer, it has been also shown that
once an estimation of the unknown disturbance inputs is obtained their effect can be compensated
by an additional element, which is based on the
estimated value of the disturbance forces, that is
included in the control loop to improve system robustness.
The performance of the proposed control
scheme has been evaluated through numerical simulation tests, providing an reasonable attenuation
rates with an acceptable control signal for different kinds of external disturbances. Further studies
are needed to include the actuators dynamics on
the global model.
