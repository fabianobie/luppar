INTRODUCTION

Most industrial processes are multi-input multioutput (MIMO) systems. Due to the interactions
between inputs and outputs, it is difficult to design a controller for each loop independently. A
solution is to design a MIMO controller that takes
the interactions into account.
In last decades, many MIMO control approaches have been proposed. However, it is
mostly used on a higher-level of the control system
architecture to provide setpoints for regulatorlevel. In regulator-level, PIPID based control
is still dominant techniques used. There are basically two PIPID based control schemes decentralized control and decoupling control (Xiong
et al., 2007).
Decentralized control consists of a set of SISO
(single-input single-output) controllers which are
designed for each loop by taking interactions into
account. It is a valid approach because, in some
cases, the performance increase obtained by using
MIMO control structures does not justify its design and maintenance. Several decentralized control design methods have been proposed, including detuning methods (Luyben, 1986), sequential loop closing methods (Shiu and Hwang, 1998)
and equivalent transfer function methods (Huang
et al., 2003). When interactions are modest it is
normally adequate. Nevertheless, it may fail to
give acceptable responses if there exist severe interactions. To overcome this, decoupling control
scheme is used. In this scheme, a decoupler is introduced between the decentralized controller and
the MIMO process to eliminate the effect of interactions. Thus, the MIMO process can be handled as multiple SISO loops and a less conserva-

tive SISO control design method can be directly
applied (Cai et al., 2008).
The theory of decoupling control has been
well-established in literature.
Most of them
were suggested for two-input two-output (TITO)
processes in terms of dynamic decoupling. In
(Shinskey, 1996) decoupling of TITO processes are
discussed in details. Dynamic decoupling control
methodologies are classed in three types ideal decoupling, simplified decoupling and inverted decoupling (Shinskey, 1996). The ideal decoupling is
rarely used in practice due to its complicated elements and realizability problems. Simplified decoupling control of TITO processes are discussed
in this paper.
In (Wang et al., 2000), the simplified decoupler was designed assuming that a FOPTD (firstorder plus time-delay) TITO model was known.
Because the unavoidable model mismatch, the decoupler only effectively compensate interactions
where the model is accurate in terms of frequency.
For control purposes, it is interesting an effective
decoupler at certain desired frequencies. Recently,
a procedure to evaluate and redesign simplified
decouplers using relay-based experiment was proposed in (Acioli Junior and Barros, 2011). The
aim of the proposed procedure is to design a simplified dynamic decoupler to be effective at frequencies of interest, which is achieved by first
estimating an accurate FOPTD model at those
frequencies. A simple frequency-domain identification technique with adequate relay-based experiment is used to estimate the FOPTD model.
An initial simplified decoupler is designed using
this model. The initial decoupler is evaluated and
redesigned to achieve effective decoupling at frequencies of interest.

In this paper, the procedure proposed in
(Acioli Junior and Barros, 2011) is revised. The
procedure is applied to a TITO laboratory-scale
thermal process. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the problem statement is presented. The initial decoupler design is considered
in Section 3. In Section 4, the decoupler evaluation method is presented. The decoupler redesign
technique is proposed in Section 5. The experimental result is discussed in Section 6 followed by
conclusion in Section 7.

Relay-Based Experiment

The standard relay feedback test is commonly
used to generate sustained oscillations of the controlled variable near and to get the ultimate gain
(Ku ) and frequency (180 ) from the experiment
data (Astrom and Hagglund, 1995). For a pure
FOPTD model, the knowledge of a frequency
point (for example, Ku and 180 ) and the process static gain uniquely characterizes model. In
(Astrom and Hagglund, 2006), analytical expressions for estimating FOPTD model parameters
from a single relay experiment plus an estimate of
the process static gain is presented. The same expressions can be used to estimate FOPTD model
with the knowledge of any other frequency point
information and the process static gain.
In this paper, a single relay plus an integrator is used to estimate a FOPTD model with accurately at frequency for which the phase is -90o
(90 ). This relay experiment is performed on G(s)
as an independent single-relay, i.e. only one loop
at a time is subject to the relay structure while
the other is kept open. In order obtain the process
static gain together with a frequency point information at 90 , the relay+integrator structure is
applied during an integer number n of sustained
oscillation periods (T90 ) plus a rectangular pulse
of width T90 2. Here, n is usually used equal to 2
or 3.
Consider the block diagram shown in Figure
1. Applying the relay structure to loop 1 (u01 ) with
loop 2 open, the output response y 1   y11 y21 
can be recorded. Similarly, for loop 2 (u02 ) with
loop 1 open, the output response y 2   y12 y22 
can be recorded.

Experimental Results

In this section the procedure to evaluate and
redesign simplified decoupler is applied to a
laboratory-scale temperature system.
6.1

Experimental Setup description

The experimental setup is a laboratory-scale thermoelectric system. This consists of two peltier
modules, two LM35 temperature sensors, a metal
plate, two heat exchangers, two fans, a PLC
(Programmable Logic Controller) and a PC with
SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition). The peltier modules act as heat pumpers
on two sections of a flat metal plate heat load.
The heat exchangers and fans are used to transfer
heat from the opposite faces of each peltier module. The process works as a coupled two-input
two-output process. Power is applied using PWM
actuators while the temperatures are measured using LM35 sensors. In (Barros et al., 2008) the
experimental setup is described in details.
The dynamic behavior of a thermoelectric system results in a complex model that is highly nonlinear. For control purposes, a model reduction
can be made.

From the frequency-domain decoupler error
indexes values (Table 3) it can be seen that the
procedure to evaluate and redesign decouplers
have improved the decoupling at frequency of interest. In this example, the redesign decoupler
cases 2 and 3 presented similar improvement over
the case 1.

Conclusions

In this paper the procedure to evaluate and redesign simplified decouplers using relay experiment presented in (Acioli Junior and Barros,
2011) was revised. This procedure is applied to a
TITO laboratory-scale thermal process. The procedure improved the decoupling at frequency of
interest by the evaluation and redesign an initial
simplified decoupler. The decoupler redesign case
2 and 3 provides similar results.
