Abstract In this paper are discussed and calibrated univariate models (scalar approach, SARIMA) and multivariate models
(vector approach, VAR and VEC) aiming traffic forecasts of equivalent axles in the Anchieta-Imigrantes system. The best performance models in the backtesting procedure were those of the second type (vector), having a mean absolute error of approximately 3, in a monthly frequency.

 actual traffic turned out to lie between
86 below forecast to 51 above forecast. This considerable error range illustrates the possible magnitude of uncertainty when traffic risk is passed to the
private sector.

Introduction

One of the main problems in the toll road sector is
the cash flow planning and its forecasting, due to its
idiosyncratic complexity, e.g. levels of service, seasonal effects and the inertial evolution of the traffic
and to the impact of other variables like the Gross
Domestic Product (GDP).
There is a wide range of methods applied to traffic
forecasting, from Time Series models, Kalman Filter
based models, Neural Networks to Markov Chain
models, simulation models (multi-agent based) and
linear regression models, as shown by Bolshinsky
and Freidman (2012), or a combination of them according to Fillatre et al. (2005), varying from highfrequency to low-frequency data.
Also, it is important to notice that despite the rich
existing literature on traffic forecasting, little attention has been paid to the prediction ability of most of
these methods, as can be seen in (Bain, 2009). In
fact, there is a considerable error range in the U.S.
traffic forecasts, as pointed by the same author

Hence, planning and forecasting play a fundamental role in this field, in the sense that most of the necessary investments and, consequently, their respective decision-makings and cash outflows, must take
into account a very long timeline  conception, construction, maturation of the project until plain capacity, etc.
Thus, the main goal of this paper is the discussion
of an alternative traffic forecasting method in toll
roads  in this case Vectorial Autoregressive models
(namely VAR and VEC) and Univariate time series
based on Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) models, discussed in the next session  illustrating one of the
most important highway systems in Brazil, the Anchieta-Imigrantes System.
This paper is divided into the following sections

Ltkepohl (1991), where it is introduced an error
correction term.
In order to verify the cointegration assumption, in
the current paper the approach that was made is the
verification that all variables are non-stationary, using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (1979) test, using a
95 confidence interval then  if and only if the
variables are non-stationary  following Engle and
Granger (1987), the cointegration residuals are obtained by running a regression over the variables and
these residuals are tested for stationarity. If these
residuals are stationary (tested using the Augmented
Dickey-Fuller test again) the time series are cointegrated, otherwise they are not cointegrated.
In order to explain how the VEC model structure
is obtained, one can start from a two variable dynamic_system, where both are cointegrated (by hypothesis), following (Hendry and Juselius, 2000, 2001
Ltkepohl, 1991, 2004 and Morettin, 2011).
Be Y1,t and Y2,t two non-stationary cointegrated

2 Methodology
2.1 Univariate Models
The Univariate approach in the present paper is
based on SARIMA models, which are a natural extension to the classical ARIMA models, which is a
product of two ARIMA polynomials, one with the
regular structure of the time series, and the other one
with the seasonal structure of the time series, as can
be seen in (Box and Jenkins, 1976 Hamilton ,1994
and Morettin and Tolói, 2004).
2.2 Multivariate Models
The Multivariate Models are mainly based on Vector Autoregression models. These are nothing more
than a multivariable extension of the classical scalar
auto regression models (AR), in the sense that the
process is described in terms of matrices and vectors,
instead of scalars. Thus, there is a mutual causality
relationship between all variables in this dynamic
system. For example, a VAR(p) process can be written as

variables, and assume that there is an equilibrium
relation between them given by

Y1,t  Y2,t  t  N(0,  ) (2)
If considered that the variations in Y1,t and Y2,t de-

Yt  1Yt1 + 2Yt2 +... +  pYtp + at (1)
where the

i

pend on the deviations of this equilibrium in t-1, it
follows that

terms are square matrices of order n

Y1,t  1 (Y1,t1  Y2,t1 ) + a1,t  a1,t  N(0,  1 )
(3.1)

Ytn are 1 x n vectors of endogenous variables at
is a 1 x n vector of uncorrelated residuals n is
the endogenous variable number and p is the number of lags.
In addition to that, as the classical scalar auto regression models (AR), if all variables are stationary,
this model can be estimated using the Ordinary Least
Squares (OLS) method. On the other hand, when one
or more variables in VAR models are non-stationary,
the OLS results may be not valid anymore. Consequently, the Theory of Cointegration was developed
in order to analyze these possible relationships between non-stationary time series.
Furthermore, Granger and Newbold (1974) discussed and exposed the problems of spurious regressions over non-stationary time series. They also verified that given two series completely uncorrelated
and non-stationary, the regression between them may
produce a significant apparent relationship.
Therefore, if two variables are non-stationary and
have a long-run equilibrium relationship, they may
be cointegrated  that is, both are uncorrelated, nonstationary, but with a relationship between them  as
exposed by Ashley and Granger (1979), Engle and
Granger (1987) and Johansen (1988).
Thus Vector Error Correction Models (VEC) were
developed, which can be seen as extensions to VAR
according to Hendry and Juselius (2000, 2001) and

Y2,t   2 (Y1,t1  Y2,t1 ) + a2,t  a2,t  N(0,  2 )
(3.2)
One can generalize this error correction model into
a more general form, where these corrections in the
equilibrium may depend on previous changes in the
equilibrium due to possible autocorrelations, like

Y1,t  1 (Y1,t1  Y2,t1 ) + 1,1Y1,t1 + 1,2 Y2,t1 + a1,t
 a1,t  N(0,  1 )
(4.1)

Y2,t   2 (Y1,t1  Y2,t1 ) + 2,1Y1,t1 + 2,2 Y2,t1 + a2,t
 a2,t  N(0,  2 )

(4.2)

where this model actually is a VAR(1) model. In
order to verify that, one can simply put these pair of
equations into matrix form, resulting in (5) and (6).

In this case, the rank of cointegration is the number of cointegrating vectors  which is tested according to (Johansen, 1988) and the least Information
Criterion number determines the number of lags, in
both univariate and multivariate models, as suggested
in (Ltkepohl and Krtzig, 2004). For multivariate
models, Bayesian Information Criterion was chosen,
due to the fact that it imposes stronger penalties for
the inclusion of new parameters, as this kind of model naturally happens to have a larger number of parameters. On the other hand, for univariate models,
Akaike Information Criterion was used, due to the
fact that these models generally have less parameters
than the multivariate ones.
The estimation of the parameters and all tests mentioned are computed using GRETL  Gnu Regression, Econometrics and Time Library (for multivariate models) and R (univariate models).

Actually, according to Gujarati et al. (2011) such
relationship can be generalized and guaranteed by the
Granger Representation Theorem, which shows that
any VAR(p) can be written as a VEC(q) and viceversa.
Depending on the autocorrelation structure, one
might find interesting having a VEC(q) model and its
respective VAR(p). More details can be found in
(Greene, 2005).

4 Results
3 Presentation of the Problem
In Table 1, are presented the results of the Bayesian
Information Criteria lag-search for multivariate models.

In this paper, it is considered a VAR and a VEC
model with the following variables traffic and Gross
Domestic Product (GDP)  all of them endogenous,
and two kinds of univariate SARIMA models, one
with a seasonal difference plus an stochastic seasonal
shock, and another one with an autoregressive seasonal term. The GDP is available at IPEA (Instituto
de Pesquisas Econômicas Aplicadas  Brazilian
Institute of Applied Economic Research) site, while
the other series are publicly available upon request to
ARTESP  Transportation Regulatory Agency of
São Paulo State, Brazil (Agência Reguladora de
Transportes do Estado de São Paulo). The time series encompasses monthly observations from March
31st, 1998 until July 31st, 2013. The last six observations are left to test the prevision accuracy of the
model.
In addition to that, it is possible to point out as a
main concern the fact that considering the Gross
Domestic Product as an endogenous variable may be
counter-intuitive. However, it is known that traffic
can act as a leading indicator for the GDP behavior,
and actually, such assumption is tested in this paper,
through the verification of cointegration between
both variables.
The traffic was normalized under an equivalent
vehicle basis, in order to transform different types of
vehicles in cars, e.g. a heavy truck is equivalent to
n cars, while a light truck is equivalent to n-2
cars.
The Seasonality in the vector models was considered by including a vector of dummy variables, since
the data is on a monthly basis.
Then, having all the time series normalized, considered the seasonal effects, the rank of cointegration
and the number of lags must be established.

So, as can be seen in this table, the multivariate
models must have only one lag.
For the univariate models, it was tested down for
the most common lag compositions over shocks and
autoregressive terms, according to the auto.arima
function, provided in forecast package, within the
R statistical software, to check the optimal ARIMA
regular structure. It resulted in an ARIMA polynomial of the form ARIMA (p1, d1, q4). In words, a
first-order auto-regressive part a first-order difference over the original series and four lags over the
innovations (shocks).
Then, the two most usual seasonal polynomials
were calibrated, SARIMA (p1, d0, q0) and
SARIMA (p0, d1, q1), following the same notation above.
The Rank of cointegration was determined according to the Johansen test (1988), and for a null rank
matrix (null hypothesis), there is a p-value of 0.03.
So, the statistical evidence points out that there is no
cointegrating relationship between the variables. De-

spite that, in this paper the VEC model was still estimated for comparison purposes.
Thus, 4 different models were obtained as follows.

Thus, if the month to be predicted is January, one
must sum up the coefficient S1 plus the constant, and
so on according to the respective predicted month.
Finally, the VEC model with seasonal dummies is
presented as follows.

5 Analysis of the Results
Aiming the selection of the best model, the out-ofsample forecasting accuracy is measured in terms of
the absolute error mean, as follows.

Thus, the very surprising result is that the VEC(1)
model, that shouldnt be even estimated according to
the existing literature, is the best model in terms of
out-of-sample performance, despite the fact that only
six samples out of the validation set were used due to
sampling issues, which may influence these results.
Nonetheless, it was already expected that a multivar-

628

Anais do XX Congresso Brasileiro de Automática
Belo Horizonte, MG, 20 a 24 de Setembro de 2014

iate model should perform better than an univariate
model, due to the fact that more information is being
included. Another interesting fact is that the loglikelihood of the univariate models are far worse than
the multivariate ones, as can be seen in Table 5  the
model which has the largest log-likelihood is the best
one.

the other hand, vector based models (Figure 1) rely
on seasonal deterministic dummy variables. Thus,
despite past values are unknown to the autoregressive
part, there are already values being inserted in the
model, providing estimates of the seasonal fluctuations.
Another interesting point is the fact that, despite having a larger number of variables (multivariate), they
had a poorer performance within the sample, so basically, the models which were actually overfitted were
the univariate ones.
Finally, here it is shown the most important feature
of vector models in terms of policy analysis, which is
the impulse response structure that can be retrieved
of the system, following (Sims, 1980).
This method is based on the decomposition of the
covariance matrix using a Cholesky algorithm, to
obtain what is called a Structural VARVEC.

Hence, based on these results, it seems that the
backtesting procedure is a very important part of the
modeling process, since the log-likelihood estimate
does not provide all necessary information to analyze
which model is the best.
When analyzing the models fitted values against the
observed values (Obs in Figures 1 and 2), it is possible to see that SARIMA (Figure 2) models converge slower towards to the observed values than the
vector based models. It can be explained due the fact
that these univariate seasonal models rely on past
observed values to forecast the seasonal factors. On

Considering it as a VAR with contemporaneous relationships, as in the following expression.

0 Yt  1 Yt1 + 2 Yt2 +... + n Ytn + K + at (12)
Multiplying the whole equation by the inverse of

0 one gets a VAR as in Equation (1), that can be
estimated using the traditional OLS algorithm.

629

Therefore, after decomposing the covariance matrix, it is possible to impose causal restrictions, in
order to retrieve the contemporary relationship matrix.
So, for example, if thought that the economy (GDP)
is expected to cause the traffic in the road, one may
infer how the dynamics between the time series may
behave with an impulse-response of the traffic
against the GDP.
This is a powerful tool that enables the researcher to
verify dynamic effects instead of just applying a
first-order (linear), as in the traditional simple linear
regression over the logarithms of the variables (this
procedure is actually called elasticity calculation).

6 Conclusion
In this paper it was shown that it is possible to
build an autoregressive multivariable model to describe the traffic data in one of the most important
Toll Road in Brazil, with significant seasonal effects
and a large amount of vehicles.
Then, four kinds of models were estimated a
VAR, a VEC and two kinds of Seasonal ARIMA
models. Furthermore, it were discussed methodologies for testing the cointegration between the variables, unitary root and optimal lag structure obtention.
Thus, it is possible to observe that both multivariate methodologies produced very similar forecasts
between them, as occurred between both univariate
models too. Despite that, both kinds of models were
significantly different in the long-run and in the
short-run, being the first kind (multivariate) the best
of them, producing reasonable forecasts  3 mean
absolute error.
Nonetheless, it is important to notice that this paper shows the usefulness of impulse-response analysis, which seems to be far more reasonable than the
traditional elasticity measures applied over simple
linear regression based models in policy analysis.
As perspective for future analysis and work, it is
suggested expanding this analysis to other large road
systems in Brazil and other countries, continuing to
update the existing database and verifying possible
structural and parameter changes in these models,
and include in this comparison the performance of
NARX models (nonlinear autoregressive models)
and standard neural-network based models, using
only autoregressive components of the dependent
variable, or evaluate the inclusion of other possible

Figure 3. Impulse-Response of Trafego to a Shock in GDP.

As can be seen in Figure 3, a standard shock (a unitary shock in terms of the covariance matrix retrieved
in the VARVEC models) in the evolution of the
GDP causes an increase of 50 thousand vehicles,
after 4 months and reaches stability after 5 months.
