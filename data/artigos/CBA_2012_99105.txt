Abstract In this paper is proposed a new scheme of digital control designed to improve the robustness of
system with input time delay. It is proposed a discrete-time variable structure control design that takes into
account the time delay in the sliding surface to improve the performance of the system when delay is present
in the input control. The delay is greater than the discrete sampling period and is treated as a failure to be
detected and accommodated. A scheme for fault detection and accommodation is used so that when the delay is
present, the controller is adapted for the fault condition. A computer simulation is shown to illustrate the design
procedure and to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Introduction

Applications of Sliding Mode Control (SMC) implemented by digital computers have been used
more frequently in systems design (Dong and
Shi, 2011). This type of controller is characterized by using a control law that maintains the
trajectory of the states of the plant in a specific
area chosen in the state space, called sliding surface (Ribeiro, 2006). In this work it is considered
that time delay may be present in systems and
processes for several reasons, like a delay caused
by Networked Control System with treacherous
conditions (Hespanha et al., 2007). The presence
of this delay in the controlled plant reduces the
relative stability and could cause degeneration in
the performance of the system and even instability. Thus, this delay can be considered as a
failure to be detected and accommodated (Patton
et al., 1989 Simani and Patton, 2008). In (Garcia
et al., 2009) and (Lee and Lee, 1999) the time
delay was assumed to be smaller than the sampling time and was presented a SMC to minimize its degenerative effects. Now, the time delay

ISBN 978-85-8001-069-5

is considered greater than the discrete sampling
period and requires a different control strategy,
which is presented in this article. Also, a time
delay fault detection and accommodation scheme
is used to adapt the controller to fault condition
(Apolinario, 2009) (Garcia et al., 2009). The design of the proposed control is characterized by its
simplicity and efficiency to minimize the problem.

Accumulated Residuals

Consider the discrete-time system given by (8).
The discrete-time output of plant yk is compared
with the outputs of the observers. Two observers
are used. In the first one, DO, is admitted that the
system is controlled without time delay, providing
the output vector yk0 and the state vector x0k . In
the second observer, called DO-H, is assumed that
the time delay H is present, providing the output
ykH and the state xH
k .
The residual functions, for DO and DO-H, respectively are defined as (Garcia et al., 2009)

Fault Diagnosis

The lowest numerical value obtained between the
residual functions indicate the real condition of
the system. Therefore, the diagnosis of fault can
be formulated as
i) If


(38)
MIN rkH rk0  rk0 ,
then the actual system is operating without time
delay, i.e., under unfault condition.
ii) If


(39)
MIN rkH rk0  rkH ,
then the actual system is operating with time delay, i.e., under fault condition.
4.3

Controller Adaptation

The controller adaptation can be switched as the
following logic

1167

Anais do XIX Congresso Brasileiro de Autom치tica, CBA 2012.

i) If condition (38) is hold, use the controller
DSMC, equation (3),
ii) If condition (39) is hold, use the controller
DSMC-H, equation (33).
Thus the controller is adapted to operating
condition of the system.

Application

Consider the system shown in Figure 1, where an
inverted pendulum is mounted on a driven cart
(Quanser, 1998). Here, only the two-dimensional

problem is considered. The inverted pendulum is
an unstable system. This is a model of the attitude_control of a space booster on takeoff. The objective of the attitude_control is to keep the space
booster in vertical position (Caun, 2007).
In Figure 1, f is the control force, M is the
cart mass, m is the pendulum mass, x is the cart
position and  is the pendulum angle. The values
of these parameters for the system used in this
work are given in Table 1 (Quanser, 1998).
The nonlinear mathematical model for the
inverted pendulum system, used in the computer
simulations, is

In the simulations the main objective is to control the Inverted Pendulum System, even in the
presence of time delay faults. The numerical integration of the nonlinear model equations (40)
is performed by the software MatLabSimulink
(Inc., 2005), where it is used a fault detection and
accommodation scheme (Garcia et al., 2009).
It was assumed that only the plant output was
available, which are the pendulum angle  and
the position cart x. The states are obtained by
estimation using discrete-time observers (Garcia
et al., 2009). In the simulations the position cart x
has a square wave as reference signal. This type of
signal was used because it is useful to test control
robustness due to its instantaneous variations.
The inherent operational condition of the digital controller was simulated as shown in Table 2.
The unfault case indicates that there is no time
delay, therefore the system should be controlled
by DSMC, equation (3). The fault condition indicates that time delay is present, thus the system should be controlled by DSMC-H, equation
(33). For a sample time of 0, 006 seconds, the
delay value simulated was 0, 06 seconds, that is
H  10.
Two simulations are performance, both with
operational condition shown in Table 2. In the
first one, the fault detection and accommodation
scheme is active. In the second, the scheme is not
active.

control the system, even in fault conditions.
In Figure 4 it can be observed the good performance of the proposed controller DSMC-H to

To prove the efficiency of the proposed
DSMC-H controller, a simulation was performance using only DSMC. This controller is actived, even during time delay occurrence. The
results are shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. In
Figure 6 it is shown the pendulum angle. In Figure 7 the solid line represents the actual position
of the cart. Both, angle and position, tracks the
reference when the system is operating without
fault (0 to 40 seconds). When the delay fault is
present, starting from 40 seconds, the behavior of
the position cart and pendulum angle goes to instability, proving that DSMC-H controller is more
effective that the DSMC when the time delay is
present.

Conclusion

In this work the time delay in control signal was
treated as a fault to be detected and the controllers were adapted to improve the performance
of the faulty system. Two sliding mode control
designs were used a discrete-time sliding mode
control that does not compute the time delay
(DSMC) and a new discrete-time sliding mode
controller which takes into account the time delay (DSMC-H). It was proven that the proposed
discrete-time control DSMC-H presents robustness with respect to time delay. Simulations in a
Inverted Pendulum System were presented. The
obtained results proved the effectiveness of the
proposed DSMC-H controller.
