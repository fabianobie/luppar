2.1

The three-wheeled tilting vehicle
The model

The development of this work was based on computer model of a six degrees of freedom for the dynamic behaviour of a three-wheeled vehicle with
variable camber, proposed in (Vieira et al., 2009).
A compact view of the model is presented here.
For a detailed one, please refer to (Vieira et al.,
2007) (Vieira et al., 2009).
The representation of the chassis of the vehicle
and the coordinate system adopted is shown in
Figure 1.

Nowadays, the use of more efficient vehicles is
being discussed to improve the energy performance and to better utilize the space of existing
roads. To solve the problems relating to traffic
in cities, the design of smaller vehicles, with a
better weightload relation, has been proposed in
several studies (Ashmore, 2006) (Johannsen and
et al., 2003) (Gehre et al., 2001) (Brink and Kroonen, 2004). One of these projects is under develop
at the Federal University of Santa Catarina, a narrow vehicle for two passengers, to meet these requirements, in (Vieira et al., 2007). Even that
they are a good solution for traffic jams, this kind
of vehicles have stability problems, mainly due to
its small width.
One solution to this problem is to allow the
vehicle to tilt in curves, as a motorcycle. This
principle has been used in vehicles such as the F
300 Life-Jet Mercedes-Benz, and the Lean Machine of General Motors. The purpose of this
paper is to present a controller capable to tilt the
vehicle by the steering angle manipulation, in a
transparent way to the driver in order to achieve
the desired tilting angle, improving safety and vehicle performance.

Figure 1 Three-dimensional model of the 3wheeler, with the coordinate axes.
The vehicle consists of a central mass (body 2)
and three wheels (bodies 1,3 and 4), two located

3464

in the front. The center of the coordinate system
axes is located at the point of contact of the rear
wheel of the vehicle, and a dextrorotatory system
is assumed. The model uses six degrees of freedom

As for body 3, there are displacements with
respect to the three axes. Hence there are components produced by rotations in the three directions, as it can be seen in Figure 4. Linear and
angular velocities of body 3 respectively are

Velocities formulation

Using the variables, the sign convention and the
coordinate system described in the former subsection, the velocity of each of the bodies can be formulated.
From the velocities shown in Figure 2, the
equation of the linear and angular velocities of rear
wheel (body 1) can be written as

Replacing in equation 9 the velocities given
by equations 21, 22, 23, 18, 5, 6, 7 and 8, one can
obtain the vehicle kinetic energy.

Potential energy

In this model it is assumed that potential energy
is stored in the suspension springs, in the tyres
(because of its elasticity) and in the vertical movement of body 2 exclusively. Hence, the potential
energy equation obtained from this considerations
is

In four-wheeled vehicles (conventional cars), the
rotation about the X axis (angle ), also called
rolling, is undesirable. In two-wheeled vehicles
(such as motorcycles and bicycles), the rolling angle is used to maintain stability and facilitate the
cornering of the vehicle. In the design of threewheeled vehicle, the manipulation of the rolling
angle allows effects caused by the force of inertia
during turns to be compensated, providing better
stability and higher performance. Figure 5 shows
that in the presence of an angle  there is a repositioning of the centers of mass of each body of
the vehicle, with a increased stability due to the
resulting force - a combination of gravity and inertia - in the central plane of the wheel. In this
model, the angle  can be adjusted dynamically.

The objective of this study is to develop a controller that, by the manipulation of the steering
angle, adjusts the tilting angle  to nullify tranversal forces in the bodies, where the desired angle
is obtained from a simplifyed relationship between
the vehicle speed v, the desired steer angle d , the
acceleration of gravity g and the distance a4 between the axles of the vehicle (Kidane et al., 2008)

Vehicle cornering limits

To better analyze the performance of the controller, it is necessary to set a limit to the steering
angle and the vehicle speed. These limits were
established according to the Departamento Nacional de Estradas de Rodagem, which sets standards for the construction of roads in Brazil (Lee
et al., 2000).
This work will consider as limit the values for
a 4 superelevation track (the minimum values
available), once that the computational model of
the vehicle do not simulates it. To simplify the
problem, it is assumed an average steering value
for the front wheels (), and is possible to relate

To design the controller, a model linearized
around operating points is needed. The synthesis
of linear controllers is simpler and has extensive
computational and mathematical tools to aid, and
therefore was considered as a first approach to the
design of control.
Applying the linearizing block tool from
software Simulink, linearized transfer functions
were obtained considering as input the steering
angle and as output variable the tilting one. These
transfer functions were obtained for speeds of 7,
8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27 and 29 ms
in straight path.
Analyzing the transfer functions, it is possible
to see that, as the vehicle speed increases, the gain
of the transfer function of the system changes, as
shown in Table 2.

rear axles of the vehicle and R is the radius of

is obtained, which defines the maximum steering
angle for vehicle cornering at different velocities.
These are the values that define the limits for this
project.

Control System

In a variable camber vehicle, there are two variables that can be manipulated the torque of the
steering (STC) and torque applied to the tilting
system (DTC), resulting respectively in a steering
angle and a camber angle. In (Gohl and Rajamani, 2004), the synthesis of two controllers to
handle these variables are able to control the system satisfactorily.
Some tests using the computational model
of the vehicle dynamic behavior were conducted,
which proved to be possible to control the camber angle with only one control variable acting on
the system the steering. The control of the system by the steering means great savings for the
project reducing the energy and size of the components, compared to acting in direct control of
torque. Thus, the synthesis of a steering controller
began from the analysis of the existing mathematical model for the vehicle, given the goal of reducing the error between the ideal angle and the
actual tilt angle of the vehicle. A key element in
controlling by STC in this type of vehicle is the
effect known as counter-steering. It consists in applying a steering angle in the opposite direction to
the desired movement for a short period of time,
causing the vehicle to tilt in the right direction (Sharp, 2006) (Gohl et al., 2006).
The computational model of the vehicle consists of nonlinear equations, and is represented by
a multi-variable system. For a first approach to
the problem, a linear control with scale scheduling gain is proposed.

The controller is then adjusted, so that the
response of the closed loop system is stable and,
did not present large variations in the control signal  (steering) and in the tilting angle , causing
discomfort to passengers.
To control the system, a continuous third order controller is chosen. This is used to reduce the
effects of non-dominant poles that can cause oscillations in the systems response and zeros very
close to the dominant poles, which would cause
undesired peaks in the response.
The controller input is the tilting error, given
by the difference between the desired angle and
the actual instantaneous tilting angle of the vehicle. The desired angle is calculated by determining the optimal tilting value for which the lateral
forces to the plane of the wheel of the vehicle are
canceled (Kidane et al., 2008). For this project we
define the following specifications to be met
 Zero-error tracking reference.
 Settling Time(5) 1.5 seconds.
 Maximum overshoot 20.

Using the Sisotool software, available in Matlab, the poles and zero of the controller are adjusted to meet these specifications. The controller
designed is given by transfer function described in

From these values, it is possible to compute

Thus, we have that the controller gain will be calculated according to Equation 22 and 23

Kc (v) 
Once the gain of the system changes accordly
to the vehicle speed, a brief study of this effect was
done. For different longitudinal velocities, a controller with a constant gain Kc will present different responses. To maintain the response characteristics over all the longitudinal velocity range, is
necessary to change the value of Kc accordly. Figure 7 shows how the relationship between longitudinal velocity and system gain changes trought the
speed range.
When adjusting the value of Kc , placing the
dominant poles of closed loop in 3  3.8, it is
possible to speed up the response and reduce the
overshoot.
Analyzing the dynamic model of the vehicle,
the steering angle applied and the tilting angle are
related. Thus, applying the transformation given
by Equation 21 linearizes the system

With the parameters calculated from the linearized transfer functions, we set the block diagram in Simulink software to verify the controllers

Figure 10 Steering input from driver.
The desired steering values were selected using as basis values the vehicle cornering limits defined in section 3.1. However, this bounds often
are transpassed. This shows that the closed loop
system is able to work beyond normal conditions,
such as in situations where it is necessary to bypass obstacles in the road.
Figures 11, 12 and 13 show the simulated behavior for the vehicle in the situation where the
controller compensates for changes in speed and
the desired direction, causing the vehicle to zero
error in the steady steady.
Figures 15 and 14 show in greater detail the
control action (steering angle of the wheel) and the
tilting angle of the vehicle, during the simulation
time in which the driver changes the input steering
of the vehicle from -0.8 to +0.8 degrees.

conditions where the vehicle speed changes. The
angles obtained for these conditions are within the
expected range according to the constructive characteristics of the vehicle and the steering angle
applied by the driver. By reducing the error between the actual and ideal tilting angle, we have
smaller lateral forces acting on the vehicle, which
represents an increased cornering stability.
The use of variable gain in the structure of
the controller allowed its use in a greater range of
speeds.Even under speed changes during cornering, the vehicle has maintained its stability and
characteristics of smoothness in movement.

The use of more efficient vehicles is proving to
be necessary, and tilting three-wheeled vehicles
are been studied for some time by car companies.
This project aims to deepen the studies of stability and control for tilting vehicles, improving its
performance. This paper was presented a solution based on classical control techniques applied
to linearized models, where the vehicle is tilted to
a desired steady angle nly by steering acting. This
technique reduces the energy needed to control the
vehicle by other variables (eg, DTC), which result
in lower costs.
Modifying the gain of the classic controller
proposed in accordance with the vehicle speed, it
is possible to maintain a stable behavior in the
full range of speeds while maintaining low oscillatory response, which means more comfort for the
occupants of the vehicle. These results were verified using the proposed controller to the non-linear
computer model of the vehicle.
In future studies, it is expected the analysis
of system robustness to parameter variations, and
the study of new control and and discrete algorithms to be applied to a prototype vehicle scale.
