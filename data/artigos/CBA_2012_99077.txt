Abstract This paper presents and discusses a fault-tolerant control model on a autonomous underwater
vehicle (AUV) with six thrusters, using five degrees of freedom. Simulations were made when there are no faults
and when faults occur in two of the horizontal thrusters. The kinematics and dynamics of the vehicle and the
thrusters are explained and it is given an introduction of automatons and how they were used as base to build
the vehicles supervisory control, created through the Stateflow tool from the software MATLAB.

Introduction

Aside with the development of technologies in this
area, the use of robots to accomplish a variety
of activities is in constant growth. The mobile
robotics is dedicated to the study of remotely
operated vehicles (ROV) or autonomous vehicles
(AUV), acting in various types of environment.
An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)
consists on a robotic vehicle that discards the necessity of an operator. An AUV has the capability
to perform recognition and exploration missions,
oceanographic researches, oceanic mining and underwater structures inspections such as dams, turbines and oil rigs. Another important feature is
its use in places with high risk for humans.
Despite the utmost care on the construction
of an AUV, as a robotic vehicle, it is leaning to
have failures. The maintenance cost can be extremely expensive, therefore, the study of faulttolerant dynamic_systems is essential. This kind
of system auto-adjusts itself in case of a fault detection and continue to fulfil its required function,
although there can be some error.
Usually, the faults occur due to seaweeds or
ropes that get stuck in the thruster or the infiltration of water in electronic components of the
vehicle. There are, however, some faults that cannot be adjusted by a fault-tolerant control and can
cause the mission to be aborted and the vehicle to
be collected for repairs.
The outline of this paper is as follows in section 2 there will be made a study of the kinematics
and dynamics of autonomous underwater vehicles,
capable of moving along the three dimensions and

using 5 degrees of freedom. The third section consists in the thruster modelling, there will be used
six thruster four of them for the horizontal movement and two for the vertical movement. In section 4, an introduction about automata, representation of automata and supervisory control will be
shown. How the supervisory control can be built
based on automata and using the Statef low R
tool is explained in section 5. Finally, a combination of faults on the horizontal thrusters is going
to be simulated (in section 6) and discussed (in
section 7).

Vehicle Modelling

Cinematic Modelling

When modelling an underwater vehicle, it is convenient to use two reference systems one is a
body-attached frame located in the center of mass
of the vehicle and with the coordinates XY Z, the
other is a inertial frame located on Earth and with
the coordinates X0 Y0 Z0 . To describe the complex
movement of an underwater vehicle with 6 degrees
of freedom it is used the Newton-Euler approach,
as shown on Fig. 1.
The linear velocities are known as surge (u),
sway (v) and heave (w), and the angular velocities are known as roll (p), pitch (q) and yaw (r).
To transform the linear velocities from the bodyattached frame to inertial frame it is used (1) and
for the angular velocities it is used (2).

for the movement to occur. The thrusters are
mounted in pairs in a way that there are four horizontal and two vertical, located around the center
of gravity. Fig. 2 shows this distribution based on
(Choi and Kondo, 2010).
Each thruster is composed by a DC servomotor Pittman PITMO DC Model 14202 series, a
set of reduction gears, a propeller and a thruster
tunnel. The construction of the block diagram
for each is made using the equations presented
in (Cody, 1992). Since that must be known the
force from one thruster, provided the voltage in put, there are three main equations

Dynamic Modelling

The movement of the underwater vehicle can be
described by a dynamic equation that can be
found in several literatures. As in (Fossen, 1994),
the equation is as follows
M (q) + C(q, ) + D(q, ) + G(q)  

(5)

Where M6x6 is the matrix of the vehicles inertia, including the rigidity matrix and the additional mass C6x1 is the vector with the centrifugal effects relative variables and the Coriolis
forces D6x1 and G6x1 are the vehicles drag and
restoring forces (weight and thrust forces) vectors,
respectively 6x1 is the generalized forces and momentum vector 6x1 is the linear and angular velocities vector relative to the body-attached frame
of the vehicle and q6x1 is the generalized coordinates vector, in other words, it denotes the vehicles position and orientation in the inertial frame
(Tavares, 2003).

The coefficients motor torque constant Kt ,
motor constant for back EMF Km , armature inertia Jm and motor resistance R are provided by
the manufacturer of the motor.
The inertia of the pinion Jdg , the inertia of
the propeller Jp , the cross sectional area A and
the reduction gear ratio N were calculated using
the specifications provided by the manufacturer
and the characteristics of the propeller.
The length of the tunnels L was determined
by direct measurement and the density of the water  was assumed to be constant throughout the
course and at standard temperature and pressure.
The motor shaft friction Cm , the propeller
shaft friction Cp , the added length Ma , the momentum correction factor B and the propeller
efficiency  are unknown parameters, initially estimated.
All of these coefficients and how they were
estimated and calculated can be found in (Cody,
1992). Therefore, the block diagram was mounted
as shown on Fig. 3.
The block diagram was made in a way that
there are two subsystems one receiving the necessary force and calculating the necessary voltage
(subsystem 1) and one using this necessary voltage
to calculate the real force made by the thrusters
(subsystem 2). This configuration is necessary
to saturate the voltage incoming to the thrusters
(happening between subsystems 1 and 2), otherwise the risk of causing a motor burn out is highly
increased. For the experiments on this paper the
saturation was set to  24V.
The block diagrams of subsystem 1 and 2 can
be expanded as shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, respectively.
The equation that relates the forces made by
each thruster (T ), its positions (B) and the resultant forces and momentums acting on the AUV

Automata and Supervisory Control

Discrete event systems (DES) are systems with
the characteristic to have abrupt and instant
events that occur through the reception of stimulus. This events causes a intern change in the
system, which adapts to a determined state and
changes again after another event. It is through
this changes that the system evolves.
Some examples of discrete events systems are
the line systems (e.g. a bank line), communication
systems (e.g. telephone networks), manufacture
systems and traffic systems (Cury, 2001).
In the analysis of the supervisory control, the
system to be controlled corresponds to a group
of subsystems with a determined spacial distribution. Each subsystem has an original behaviour
that, when working together with the other subsystems, generates the global system behaviour.
The supervisory control is, therefore, used to
restrain this global system behaviour in a way to
fulfil its coordinated function to be executed.
Automata are models used to represent the
languages that describes the behaviour of discrete
event systems, specifying all possible and admissible sequences of events that DES are capable of
processing or generating. An automata can be deterministic or non-deterministic.
The deterministic automata have a finite set
of states, completely described functions and the
characteristic that a certain event e will cause
transitions to one and only one different state.
On the contrary, in a non-deterministic automaton an event e may cause transitions to more
than one states, moreover, there may exist transitions (empty transitions) that represents
non-observable events, causing changes in the internal state of a DES.
More information about languages and automata can be found in (Cassandras and Lafortune, 2008).
An automaton that could represent the vehicle in this paper is a deterministic automaton, as
shown in Fig. 6. Each of the states represents

ISBN 978-85-8001-069-5

fault combinations, starting at the initial state
with no faults and with the possibility to go to
the other states, with a maximum of two faults
happening.
The numbers on each states represents which
thrusters are not working, but the number 0
means all thrusters are fully functional. The transitions are named as follows first the number of
the thruster that will work or will stop working,
and second the letter w, representing that the
thruster is going from failure to working, or
the letter f , representing that the thruster is going from working to failure.
Based on the automaton shown in Fig. 6,
the control was made using the Simulink R
and Statef low R tools from M AT LAB R . The
Statef low provides the necessary graphical objects to construct finite-state machines (Karris,
2007). The created chart, shown on Fig. 7, has
the same states as the automaton, identifying each
combination of the thrusters faults.
In Fig. 6 an example of a sequence of events
is shown, the same from one of the simulations
presented on this paper.
First, the automaton is in its initial state
(State 0) as there are no faulty thrusters. The
event 1f  occurs, meaning thruster 1 goes from
working to failure. The automaton responds
going to state 1 showing that only thruster 1
is not working. After some time another event
occurs, 3f , when thruster 3 fails. After this
event, the next state of the automaton is state 13
where thrusters 1 and 3 are faulty. This keeps happening every time any event (a thruster starts or
stops functioning) occurs and, after each of these
events, the automaton goes to a new state identifying which thrusters are faulty.

combinations of faulty thrusters

When thrusters 1 and 2 are faulty, the control

When thrusters 3 and 4 are faulty, the case is
similar when thrusters 1 and 2 are faulty. Therefore, the value of the variable will be key  1 and

FAULT TOLERANT CONTROL

The principle of the presented chart is simple
based on the combinations of faulty thrusters,
there will be sent a number (denoted by key)
to the vehicles cinematic, where it will change
the thruster configuration matrix reallocating the
faulty thrusters force to the remaining working
ones. This control was made based on (Choi and
Kondo, 2010).
The following combinations 1-3, 1-4, 2-3 and
2-4 are grouped together in the same sub-chart,
since the thruster configuration matrix stays practically the same, changing only the value of the
coefficients according to the variables i and j identifying which thrusters, from the possible combinations said before, are faulty.
The thrusters configuration has a certain
fault-tolerant control, this can be seen by
analysing (19) and (20) since, in order for the resultant forces and momentum to produce the desired movement, this equations must be satisfied.
rank(BH )  dim(TH )

(19)

rank(BV )  dim(TV )

(20)

If one single horizontal thruster is faulty, the
conditions on the equations are still fulfilled. That
is why the control chart will be sending the value
key  0, meaning there wont be a change on the
thruster configuration matrix, even if one thruster
is faulty. However if more than one horizontal
thruster is faulty, the conditions will not be satisfied and the motion of the vehicle will be different.

A special case is when there is a combination
other than the two before. As has already being said, they are grouped together so the control chart will send only one value (key  3) to

Figure 13 Thrusters forces when thruster 4 is

To analyse how the vehicle will respond when
there are faulty thrusters, for the second simulation thruster 4 stops working at 300 seconds and
thruster 1 stops working at 900 seconds. The trajectory of the vehicle, the error on each axis and
the thrusters forces are shown, respectively, in
Fig. 11, 12 and 13.
It is interesting to observe, in Fig. 13, the

fault occurring in thruster 4 at 300 seconds and,
comparing to Fig. 10, the thrusters 1 and 2 start
working earlier to supply the force needed for the
desired motion. Also, as there are faults going
on, the remaining thrusters must provide a higher
force. Yet, there is a saturation in 24V , limiting
the thrusters force in 6N .
The last two parts of the trajectory are not as

desired. This happens because of the second fault
appearing and, been one of the special combinations, the trajectorys error is highly increased.

CONCLUSIONS

This paper has presented a fault-tolerant control
based on supervisory control for a autonomous
underwater vehicle (AUV) with 6 thrusters, four
horizontal and two vertical, and 5 degrees of freedom. The simulation were made when there are no
faulty thrusters and when two horizontal thrusters
fail, one at 300 seconds and the other at 900 seconds.
Through the simulations, it is shown that the
vehicle completes the given trajectory with a maximum error of 0.1m (in the x- and y-axis) when
there are no faulty thrusters an acceptable result. The result of the second simulation was not
as good as the first, however the vehicle still accomplishes the mission. When thruster 4 fails at
300 seconds the remaining thrusters start working
earlier and with a higher force (thus a higher necessary input voltage) for the vehicle to be able to
complete the desired trajectory, but the error is
still low and being a maximum of approximately
0.27m in the y-axis. When thruster 1 fails at 900
seconds, the remaining thrusters are not able to
keep the vehicle in the right trajectory generating
an error of almost 0.8m in the x-axis and 1.3m in
the y-axis.
It was shown that the vehicle used, along with
the supervisory control, is able to accomplish a
given mission with a very low error when one horizontal thruster fails. When two thrusters fails the
vehicle still accomplishes the mission, although
having some error involved.
