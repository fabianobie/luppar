Introduction

The control of wind turbine generator systems
(WTGS) has received a great deal of attention
over the last years. It has been motivated both
by the increasing interest in renewable energy due
to environmental concerns and by the technical
difficulty to deal with several wind regimes. We
can find in the literature many approaches to
tackle the control problem of a WTGS. Without attempting to be exhaustive, we can mention
PID control (Jonkman et al., 2009), LQR control
(Pintea et al., 2011) and LPV control (Bianchi
et al., 2007 Bakka et al., 2014).
The purpose of the present paper is to design
an optimal controller for an onshore three-bladed
upwind variable-speed and variable-pitch WTGS
subject to different wind regimes. We assume that
the available control variables are the generator
electromagnetic torque and the blade pitch angle. Furthermore, we assume that wind speeds are
greater than the WTGS rated wind speed, and the
controller objective is to keep the captured power
within adequate boundaries in order to avoid excessive aerodynamical and mechanical loads.
In this paper the WTGS control problem is
formally defined as a finite horizon quadratic optimal control problem of a discrete-time Markov
jump linear system (MJLS) considering the case
in which the Markov chain takes values in a general Borel space S. It is assumed that the controller has access to an output variable as well as
the jump parameter that represents the abrupt
wind speed changes. The goal is to design a
dynamic Markov jump controller such that the
closed loop system minimizes the quadratic functional cost of the system over a finite horizon pe-

riod of time. As shown in the principle of separation for discrete-time MJLS stated in (Costa
and Figueiredo, 2016), the optimal controller is
obtained from two S-coupled difference Riccati
equations, one associated to a filtering problem
and the other one associated to a control problem
in which the state variable is fully available. By
S-coupled it is meant that the difference Riccati
equations are coupled via an integral over S.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section
2 we introduce the basic notation and the control problem formulation. In Section 3 the optimal controller obtained in (Costa and Figueiredo,
2016) is presented. Section 4 is devoted to build
a MJLS model and a control problem for the
WTGS. In Section 5 we provide the results obtained from the simulation of the WTGS and some
final comments.

Problem Formulation

The goal of this section is to present a general linear quadratic control problem of a MJLS with the
Markov chain taking values in a Borel space. In
Section 4 we will show how the control problem of
a WTGS can be formulated as a linear quadratic
control problem for a MJLS. First we introduce
some notation.
Throughout the paper we fix a Borel space
S and a -finite measure  on S. For X and
Y Banach spaces we set B (X, Y) for the Banach
space of all bounded linear operators of X into
Y, with the uniform induced norm represented by
k  k. For simplicity we shall set B (X)  B (X, X).
As usual, T  0 (T > 0) will mean that the operator T  B (X) is positive semi-definite (pos-

by N1 . Fix a positive integer T > 1. The set of
nonnegative integers less or equal to T  1 will be
denoted by T and those greater than 1 and less or
equal to T  1 by T1 .
On a probability space (, F, P) we consider
a time-homogeneous Markov chain (k) k  N
taking values in a Borel space S and with transition probability kernel G() having a density g()
with respect to a -finite measure  on S, so that

Discrete-time MJLS Model and
Control Problem for a WTGS

In Section 2 we have formally presented a model
and a control problem for a discrete-time MJLS.
Recalling these definitions in this section we build
a MJLS model for the WTGS following similar steps as in (Lin et al., 2015, Section III).
The model is obtained from several interconnected
subsystems a rotor, a pitch actuator, a mechanical, and an electrical subsystem. In this section we
also present a control problem for the WTGS. The
solution for this problem was stated in Theorem 5
and it will be used in the simulation described in
the next section.

Quadratic Optimal Control with
Partial Information

In this section we present an optimal solution for
the control problem stated in Definition 2. The
optimal controller is derived from two S-coupled
Riccati difference equations, one of them associated to an optimum controller when the state variables are available, and the other one associated to
an optimal filtering problem. This result is usually
known as the separation principle and it will be
of fundamental importance when dealing with the
control problem for the WTGS to be presented in
the next section.

WTGS Discrete-time MJLS Model and Control Problem

The wind speed signal V can be expressed in a
given time instant as
V  V + v,

(22)

where V is the mean wind speed, obtained as
the average of the instantaneous speed over a
time period, and v denotes the atmospheric turbulance (Bianchi et al., 2007). Notice that accurate wind speed measurements are rarely available in practice. It is possible to estimate the
mean wind speed based on measurements of rotor
speed, blade pitch angle and generator torque using a filter, e.g., an extended Kalman filter (Bakka
et al., 2014).
From (12) and (13), the linearization of Tr
around V results in the approximation
Tr  Tr (V ) + Tr (V )v,

(23)

where

In the WTGS proposed in the present paper, we
consider that the hub is fixed to the rotor shaft
which drives the generator through a gearbox. We

Wind speed is subject to abrupt environmental changes. As a result of this variability, several linearized models are required to characterize the evolution of the WTGS. We will consider
for simplicity just two wind conditions, named
here as strong breeze and gale. This conditions
represent respectively mean wind speeds that are
slightly higher than rated speed, and pretty higher
than rated speed. We will assume that the wind
regime can be modeled by a time-homogeneous
Markov chain (k) k  N with state space
given by S  1  0, 1  2  0, 1. For
(k)  (i, t)  S the wind condition is represented
by i, with i  1 being strong breeze and i  2 being gale, and the mean wind speed V depends on
(k) as follows,

Simulation Results and Final
Comments

In this section we provide the simulation results
of the WTGS model obtained in Section 4.5.
The parameters considered in this simulation
for the WTGS are based on (Jonkman et al.,
2009 Zhang et al., 2014) and presented in Table
1. The WTGS rated wind speed is 11.4 ms and
we have adopted V11  12, V12  14, V21  15,
and V22  17 in (26). The input noise sequence
v(k) k  T was assumed a gaussian white noise
sequence. Parameters in the power coefficient approximation (15) where assigned to c1  0.39,
c2  116, c3  0.4, c4  5, c5  16.5, c6  0.089,
and c7  0.035 (Garcia-Sanz and Houpis, 2012,
Chapter 12). The sample time interval considered was Ts  6 seconds, and the simulation
lasted for 20 minutes, so that T  200. Regarding the quadratic cost, for simplicity we have
adopted, for all   S, C() C()  S()  I and
D() D()  I in (5).

where V11 , V12 , V21 , and V22 are constants. We
consider that, for (k)  (i, t), we will have
(k + 1)  (j, U ) with U being uniformly distributed in the interval 0, 1, and j  1 with
probability pi1 , and j  2 with probability pi2
(of course pi1 + pi2  1, and pij  0, i, j  1, 2).
Discretizing the model (25) using the zeroorder holder method with sample time Ts , and
considering output measurement noise, we get a
MJLS model as in (2) for the WTGS that can be
written as follows,
x(k + 1)  A((k))x(k) + B((k))u(k)
+ G((k))w(k)
y(k)  Lx(k) + Hw(k),

w(k) k  N is a 2-dimensional zero mean white
noise sequence.
Regarding the WTGS, we are interested in
solving a control problem as the one stated in Definition 2, that is, we want to find u  U that
minimizes the quadratic cost J(x0 , 0 , u) given by
(5). The control objective is to keep the WTGS
mechanical power held constant by controlling the
reference blade pitch angle and the generator electromagnetic torque. The quadratic cost represents a compromise between two performance objectives minimum tracking error and minimum
control effort.

Figure 1 Monte Carlo simulations for the WTGS
with partial observations.
The obtained results show that the approach
proposed in this paper is able to keep the WTGS
state variables within adequate boundaries. In
this paper we have considered several modes of
operation, each one associated to a different wind
condition, but only one point of operation for the
WTGS. The operation point was chosen to limit
the captured power in order to avoid excessive
aerodynamical and mechanical loads when wind
speed is higher than the WTGS rated wind speed.
When the WTGS is subject to wind conditions such that wind speed is in the range between
the WTGS cut-in and rated wind speed, the controller goal is the maximization of the power produced. In this case several operation points are
necessary to model the WTGS. Thus, an interesting direction for future theoretical research is
the study of optimal control problems for discretetime MJLS subject to abrupt changes not only in
its modes of operation but also in its operation
points.
