modulation, such as pulse width modulation, or current feedback control. The DC-AC three-level converter improves the the
output harmonic distortion. The main characteristics of the proposed configuration are examined and experimental results verify
the theoretical studies.

rectifier, as in Figure 1.

Introduction

Three-phase bidirectional AC-AC conversion
usually employs full-bridge PWM topologies, which
implies in 12 or 24 power switches for two-level or
three-level converters, respectively. In the case of
unidirectional converters, the front-end converter can
be replaced by the three-phase diode bridge rectifier,

2 Characteristics of Nabaes rectifier
2.1. Principle of operation
In the modified Nabaes converter, shown in Figure 2, each leg consists of a three-phase diode bridge
(D1 to D6), three small capacitors (Ca to Cc), three
inductors (La to Lc), four IGBTs and six diodes connected as a three-level leg. The four-switch leg allows three levels for the pole voltage vT0, that is,
S1,2,3,41100 vT0 equals Vo2,
S1,2,3,4 0110 vT0 equals 0
S1,2,3,4 0011 vT0 equals - Vo 2.
Duty cycles d1  t1100TS and d2  t0011TS are made
equal to d but shifted of 180 degrees from each other.
Because switches 1,2 and 4,3 commands are 180
degree shifted and the inductance currents operate in
discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), having three
in particular behaviors, i.e. magnetizing, demagnetizing and null inductor current, the three switching
states produce six operation modes. In each mode of
operation (Fig. 3) the working devices are highlighted. The voltage divider capacitor, formed by Ca,
Cb and Cc is supposed to reproduce the

which is simple, reliable and low cost. However, its
input current has a high harmonic content. Multi-pulse
three-phase rectifiers solve this problem but they are
heavy, bulky and expensive (Singh, 2004 Alves, 2005).
Other unidirectional solutions need the help of an additional transformer or a controlled rectifier or a threephase AC switch (Singh, 2004). The low cost converter
introduced in (Prasad, 1991) utilizes added single
switch, three input boost inductors, and three LC filters.
Also, the converter with simple control introduced in
(Nabae, 1994) automatically follows the sinusoidal

line voltage without any current control loop.
This paper proposes a three-phase AC-DC-AC
converter (Fig.1) with input power factor correction
(PFC), and independent output frequency with improved output voltage harmonic distortion. PFC is
obtained without any complicated switching modulation such as pulse width modulation or a complicated
feedback control. The front-end rectifier is a modification of the Nabaes converter (Bento, 2007) which
is free from input rush current (Takahashi, 1992).
Differently from its basic version in (Nabae, 1994 da
Silva, 2005) it can operate with variable load at constant switching frequency. Also, it is suitable to be
used in integrated topology converters (Tao, 2000

these capacitors present a ripple content less than
5. The waveforms in Fig. 4 are helpful for understanding the modes of operation.
Mode 1 In this Mode, the current paths for both
iLa and iLc consists of capacitors Ca and Cc, diodes D1
and D5, and switches S1 and S2, as shown in Fig. 3(a).
The energy continues to be stored in La and Lc while
the load is supplied by the output capacitors C1 and
C2.
Mode 2 Next, S1 is turned off while S3 is complementarily turned on. Then the currents in La, iLa,
and in Lc, iLc, now flow via capacitors Ca and Cc diodes D1 and D5, switch S2, diode D7, and capacitor
C1 and S2, as can be seen in Fig. 3(b). The slope of

Although the inductor currents are discontinuous,
the phase currents are continuous, as shown in Fig. 5.
This occurs due to the interleaving among the modes

3 The Output Three-level Inverter
Consider the constant output voltage of the rectifier
as VoE, which is the input voltage of the inverter.
The three-level voltage space_vectors diagram (Fig.
6) includes 27 space_vectors 3 zero- vectors, 12
small voltage vectors, 6 middle vectors, and 6 large
vectors. The triangle v0 , v7, and v 9 (Sector 1) can be
divided into 4 small triangles. A, B, C, and D. So it is

A. Simulation results
PSpice simulations have been done in order to verify the behavior of the rectifier structure. Simulations were made up for three different values of the
dc-link voltage, E, i.e. 250V, 350V and 500V. The
relevant parameters are L1,2,3  1, 6mH, v1,2,3  127
V rms  60Hz e fs  10 kHz. For each value of E the
duty cycle was made to vary from 0.1 to 0.5.

Figure 8 shows that the maximum power transfer
would occur for d equal to 0.5 (Fig. 8a) and that the
minimum THD of the grid current occurs for d between 0.4 and 0.49 (Fig. 8b). This indicates that a
variation of d permits control of the dc-bus with reasonable variation of THD. It has been found that for
Vo  380 V e d  0.47 the grid current THD is around

a in this case.

5 A Possible Integrated Topology
It is possible to integrate the functions of the rectifier and the inverter by replacing the S1 to S4 leg by
the S1A to S4A leg in Fig. 1. This possibility is shown
in Fig. 13.
Fig. 14 shows the load current, the comparison
of input voltage and current, and the dc-link voltage.
The modulation index used was 0.7 with a modulation frequency of 10 kHz. These simulated results
show that the proposed integrated topology is feasible.

B. Experimental results
Experimental results were obtained with the help
of a set rectifierthree-level inverter controlled by
DSP. The following parameters were used grid
phase voltages of 127 Vrms, 60 Hz, the dc-link voltage was 380V, the switching frequency was 10 kHz,
and L1,2,31,6 mH. The rectifier control signals in
Figure 10 show that the circuit operates with d 
0.47, the dead-time being 1s.
Figure 11 illustrates in detail the high power factor obtained for phases a and b at 60 Hz. Note that
the phase currents are continuous as predicted. Results for both rectifier and inverter variables are indicated in Fig. 12. The discontinuous current in inductor La is compared with the continuous grid phase
