Abstract This paper describes the design and implementation of two simple speed controllers for driving an axial magnetic
flux switched reluctance motor with only one stator, in such a way that the torque ripple is minimized. Different from the usual
strategy of pulsed current imposition in the windings of this type of machine, a control strategy with modified current shapes is
proposed. To verify the reduction of torque ripple, a machine prototype was built and two speed control systems were implemented. These controllers were conventional PID and fuzzy logic PID types. The experimental results show the effectiveness of
the proposed strategy.

Introduction

Switched reluctance motors (SRM) have been
widely used in many variable speed industrial applications. With respect to the radial magnetic flux version, some important advantages can be mentioned
high torque output, wide range of operating speed,
geometrical simplicity, reliability and robustness
(Krishnan, 2001 Miller, 1993).
The operational principle of the axial flux SRM
(AFSRM) is equivalent to the SRM with radial flux.
This can be explained using a rectangular piece of
steel which, after immersing in the magnetic flux
established between two magnetic poles, will be oriented in such a way that the equivalent air gap reluctance be the minimum. When a stator phase is excited, the pair of nearest rotor poles is attracted to align
themselves to the excited stator poles and thus
torque is produced (Sakurai, 2001).
The SRM analyses are complex because of their doubly salient pole structure and nonlinear magnetic
characteristics. The developed torque is a nonlinear
function of the currents applied to stator and the inductances, which depend on the rotor position.
In the AFSRM the air gap magnetic flux is parallel to
the rotational axis. In literature, many works are related to radial flux SRM however few works are related to axial flux SRM (Vijayakumar, et al., 2008).
Some of them refer to axial flux SRM with two stators (Krishnan, Abouzeid and Mang, 1990 Pulle and

ISBN 978-85-8001-069-5

Petersen, 1998 Huang, Luo, Leonardi and Lipo,
2000) but in this paper the motor has only one stator
(Sass, Santisteban and Sanches, 2009).
For ordinary radial flux SRM the mutual inductances
are considered small (Paula, Silva, Cardoso and Nabeta, 2003) and most researchers do not take them
into account. For AFSRM this is not true because the
magnetic flux paths are quite different from those
found in radial flux SRM. In this work, the AFSRM
self and mutual inductances were estimated based on
the three-dimensional finite element method and then
they were used in the motor electromechanical modeling.
When voltages or current pulses are imposed in the
stator windings, the level of torque ripple is high, if
compared with other kind of motors, which is a primary disadvantage of SRM because it contributes to
vibration and acoustic noise. For this reason, the imposition of different current shapes to reduce the
torque ripple appears as an interesting solution. In
this work, the procedure for obtaining alternative
shapes is described and the effectiveness of this strategy is experimentally tested.
For this, an AFSRM prototype was built and two
speed controllers were implemented a conventional
PID and a fuzzy PID. The experimental results confirm the reduction of torque ripple using the modified
current shapes.

Each stator pole has one coil, so there are six coils
named a1, a2, b1, b2, c1 and c2.
As the objective of this work was the torque ripple
minimization, the stator and rotor cores were constructed solid. Thus, the power and torque rating
were not evaluated. Nevertheless, they were found
small, as shown in the item 5.

The self and mutual inductances were estimated
based on a simulation model using the three dimensional finite element method of the Ansys Multiphysics software (Ansys, 2005) with magneto static analysis. The 96 type solid elements were used in
the simulation software.
In Figure 2, for eleven rotor positions, the self and
mutual inductances estimated are shown. The self
inductance is represented by La1a1 and the mutual
inductances are named Ma1a2, Ma1b1, Ma1b2, Ma1c1 and
Ma1c2, respectively.

Figure 2. AFSRM self and mutual inductances.

As shown in Figure 2, the self inductance has a similar profile to the radial flux SRM, which means that
the minimum inductance corresponds to the unaligned position (no overlap between rotor and stator
poles) while the maximum inductance corresponds to
the full alignment position between rotor and stator
poles. The inductances profiles repeat each 90.
From Figure 2 it can be noted that the mutual inductances between the coil a1 and the other five coils
are not negligible. For instance, the maximum relationship between them is around 0.25 near 20.
In this way, in order to provide a constant electromagnetic torque for all rotor positions, appropriate
reference currents should be designed. From previous
tests in open loop, the best current feed strategy consists of the following sequence of energizing the
windings stator (Sass, Santisteban and Sanches,
2009)
- phases a and b from rotor position 0 to 15
- only phase a from rotor position 15 to 30
- phases a and c from rotor position 30 to 45
- only phase c from rotor position 45 to 60
- phases b and c from rotor position 60 to 75
- only phase b from rotor position 75 to 90.
This cycle repeats each 90.
On the other hand, to define a reference torque without harmonics, a current of 3A is imposed in phase
"a", while the rotor position was 30. In this situation
a net electromagnetic torque of 0.0048 Nm was calculated.
Next, for every one degree, the current values of the
phase a were calculated as

Experimental hardware

The hardware to control the AFSRM consists of
a controller circuit, three power converter circuits,
one for each phase, a position sensor circuit, three
Hall Effect current measurement circuits, also one for
each phase, a torque meter connected between the
AFSRM shaft and the mechanical load shaft. The
shaft of a DC machine was used as an inertial load.
These components are arranged as shown in the
block diagram in Figure 4.

converters, forming part of the block diagram shown
in the Figure 7. As observed, this circuit, for one
phase, receives the actual currents and the reference
currents from the controller circuit, comparing them.
If the real current is greater than the reference, the
power circuit switches off the Mosfets of this phase,
thus interrupting the current in the coils.
Figure 4. AFSRM drive block diagram.

The experimental hardware is shown in Figure 5,
including the AFSRM. In this photo the parts of the
hardware used in the experiments can be identified
the controller circuit (1), the power converter circuits
(2), the position sensor circuit (3), Hall Effect current
measurement circuits (4), torque sensor and display
(5), the AFSRM (6) and the DC machine (7).

Figure 7. Power converter block diagram for one phase.

The controller circuit consists of two microcontrollers. The first one is a PIC 18F4680 that receives the
position pulse stream to calculate the real speed and
makes it available via a serial port for recording. The
other one is also a PIC 18F4680 that receives the
same rectangular pulses from the position sensor every two degrees and calculates the reference currents
of the three phases in accordance with the controller
type used, sending them to the power converter. Figure 8 shows the block diagram of this circuit.

Figure 5. Experimental hardware and AFSRM prototype.

The position sensor consists of the circuit shown in
Figure 6 and an aluminum dish with 180 holes fixed
to the rotor structure. The signal from the infrared
sensor is captured by this circuit and transformed into
a rectangular pulse stream with amplitude of 5 V,
which is sent to the controller circuit.

Both microcontrollers were programmed using the
C language. Due to their speed limitation, the controllers imposed the reference currents every 2

Experimental results

In order to evaluate the torque ripple minimization
strategy three experiments were performed
- current pulses were imposed and a conventional
PID speed controller was used
- current waveforms as in Figure 3 were imposed and
a conventional PID speed controller was used
- a fuzzy logic PID speed controller was used.
5.1 Imposing Current Pulses
In this case the current pulses were applied in the
following sequence
- phase a from rotor position 0 to 30
- phase c from rotor position 30 to 60
- phase b from rotor position 60 to 90.
The Figure 11 shows the reference current imposed
by the controller and the actual current in the coils of
one phase.

Figure 13. Torque response for current pulses with PID conventional controller.

5.2 Imposing Proposed Current Waveforms
It is straightforward to demonstrate that the mechanical model of this system consists of only one pole
that depends of the inertia moment and the viscosity
friction, thus any classical PID controller makes the
dynamic behavior stable. As both mechanical parameters were unknown, the gains were adjusted by trial
and error.
In this case, the PID gains were adjusted by simulations using the MatLab Simulink software, resulting
in gains, proportional, integral and derivative, of 16,
3 and 1, respectively.
The controller output was limited in the interval 0,
1.
Figure 14 shows the current waveform proposed as
reference and the actual current in a phase.

Figure 12 shows the speed response when current
pulses are imposed and a conventional PID speed
controller is used. The reference speed is 350 rpm.

5.3 Using Fuzzy Speed Controller
This controller was obtained using the MatLab Simulink simulations as a tool.
The fuzzy logic parameters used were minimum
And Method, maximum Or Method, minimum
Implication, maximum Aggregation and centroid
Defuzzification.
The inputs of the fuzzy logic controller were speed
error, change of speed error, integral of speed error
and angular rotor position. The output variables are
the three phases reference currents.
The input variable speed error has three linguistic
values negative, zero and positive, using trapezoidal,
triangular and trapezoidal membership functions,
respectively.
The input variable change of speed error has three
linguistic values negative, zero and positive, using
triangular membership functions.
The input variable integral of speed error has three
linguistic values negative, zero and positive, using
triangular membership functions.
The input variable angular rotor position has ten linguistic values (P1 to P10), using triangular membership functions.
The output variables reference currents have four

for fuzzy logic currents. In this case the torque ripple
was around 6.5.

This speed control strategy spends less microcontroller processing time than the conventional PID, since
it uses a look up table instead of continuous calculations.

Conclusion

In this work, particular reference waveforms for the
currents of an ASFRM in a closed loop speed control
system have been proposed and tested. Comparing
the performance of a conventional PID speed controller using current pulses with a conventional PID
speed controller using the current waveforms proposed, it is confirmed that the level of torque ripple is
diminished.
Comparing the performance of a conventional PID
speed controller using the current waveforms proposed with a fuzzy logic PID speed controller, it was
noted that the torque ripple for the first one is less,
which can be explained because the fuzzy logic currents are not similar to those that produce constant
torque.
In respect of the speed response, the fuzzy logic PID
controller reaches the steady state in less time than
the conventional PID controller and this has a small
advantage. Nevertheless, in respect of the implementation, the execution time of the fuzzy logic PID is
less than that the used with the other control strategies.
