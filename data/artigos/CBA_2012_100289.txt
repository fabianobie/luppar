Abstract A methodology of disturbance rejection applied to Boost converters is presented in this manuscript. Using a linearization of the average model of the converter, was designed a H2 state-feedback controller. The goal of this controller is
minimize the H2 -norm from the disturbance input w(t) to the converter output z(t). And so, the effect of the perturbation in the
output of the converter is attenuated and in this way the level of the load voltage remains almost constant. Also, the control system
methodology proposed allows the addition of frequency weighted, which makes possible to design a controller for a disturbance
signal input of a given frequency band. The design was described by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), that can be solved efficiently
using convex programming techniques and the optimal solutions of the stated control problems are obtained. Implementation of
the control system methodology applied to a Boost convert illustrates its effectiveness.

Resumo Neste trabalho é proposta uma metodologia de rejeição_de_distúrbio com peso na frequência aplicado ao conversor
chaveado Boost. Utilizando a linearização do modelo médio do conversor é projetado um controlador H2 de realimentação dos
estados, sendo os estados dado pela corrente no indutor e tensão no capacitor. O objetivo do controlador é minimizar a norma H2
entre o sinal de distúrbio w(t) e a saída z(t) do Boost. Deste modo, o efeito do sinal exógeno na saída é atenuado e a tensão na
carga permanece sem alteração. Ainda, o sistema_de_controle permite a inclusão de peso na frequência, o que possibilita projetar
controladores para um sinal de distúrbio em uma específica faixa de frequência. O projeto foi descrito por inequações matriciais
lineares, que podem ser resolvidas usando algoritmos de convergência polinomial, e a solução ótima para o problema é obtida. A
implementação da metodologia de sistema_de_controle aplicado ao Boost ilustra a eficiência do método.

1 Introduction
The switched DC-DC Boost converts are widely used
in many applications in electric engineering. In this
context, its main applications are process control, hybrid electric_vehicles, lighting systems, regenerative
braking of DC motors (Mohan et al., 2003), among
others. In these cases, the main function of these converters is to work in the voltage regulation. These converters are nonlinear and time-variant, and using the
linearization of the average model, see (Sum, 1989)
for more details, we can obtain a linear time-invariant
model. And so, it is possible to design a control system
in order to stabilize the Boost converter in closed-loop.
A regenerative braking of Electric Vehicles (EV)
using H2 and H methodology was presented in (Min
et al., 2007). In this work a hybrid controller is designed in order to guarantee a robust stability and system performance. The obtained controller was applied
to a Boost converter, but is not considered frequency
weighted in the design. The H control strategy also
is used in (Montagner and Peres, 2003), where the
problem of control design for DC-DC Buck converter
was solved using a state-feedback by LMIs.
In (Naim et al., 1997) was proposed a control sys-

tem with disturbance rejection applied to Boost converters. It was used a H controller designed by Ricatti equation, and it is only obtained a feasible solution to the problem. In order to obtain the optimal solution to the disturbance rejection problem, the
LMIs can be very useful. The LMI formulation has
emerged recently as a tool for solving a great number of control problems (Faria et al., 2010), (Assunção
et al., 2007), (Teixeira et al., 2019), among others.
The main features of the LMI are that a diversity of
design specifications and constraints can be described
by LMIs, and once formulated in terms of LMIs, the
problem, when it presents a solution, can be solved
by convex optimization algorithms (Nesterov and Nemirovsky, 1994).
In disturbance rejection systems applied to the
converter Boost usually is used the H -norm as
performance criterion, for instance, see (Olalla
et al., 2010) and (Sandoval-Moreno and Franco-Mejia,
2010). In this context, it is not common to observe
the use of H2 -norm. And in this work is presented
a methodology of disturbance rejection applied to the
Boost using the H2 -norm as performance criterion. In
this case, the method proposed can be used as a example for the development of other control techniques

using the H2 -norm.
A disturbance rejection methodology by LMIs
applied to Boost converter is proposed in this
manuscript. The state-feedback controller was designed in order to minimize the H2 -norm from the disturbance signal input to the output of the system, and
this way, to attenuate the influence of the disturbance
in the performance of the converter. Also, the methodology proposed in this manuscript allows the addition
of frequency weighted, which becomes possible to design a controller for a disturbance signal of given frequency band. The main result is that the voltage load
remains almost constant when the input voltage and
load current of the converter present variations in their
nominal values.
The controller obtained by LMIs provides a disturbance rejection system that has a performance
based on the frequency of the disturbance signal.
This frequency is a performance specification design.
The methodology presents the optimal solution of the
problem with small computational effort, because the
LMIs can be solved using algorithms of linear programming. A practical example was implemented
in order to show the effectiveness of the proposed
method.

Problem 1 The disturbance rejection problem, using
the state-feedback and considering the average model
of the Boost converter described in (9), is minimize the
H2 -norm between the output z(t) and the exogenous
input w(t) by the design of the H2 controller K. And
so, the effect of disturbance signal in the output of the
system is attenuated.

In designing the control system, it is added frequency weighted, because it is interesting that the disturbance rejection system executes its functions in a

In this practical example, it was considered a Boost
converter operated in continuous conduction mode,
see Figure 1. This converter transforms a nominal
12 V input voltage (Vin (t)) into 24 V at its output
(VC (t)). It was simulated changes in the load through
of the change in the output current, also it is considered disturbance signal in the input voltage of the converter. The switching frequency is 98 kHz, and the
parameters of the Boost converter were L equal to
210 H, C equal to 220 F and R equal to 48.3 .
From (4), the average model linearized at the operating point D  0.5, and VCnon  24 V , can be describe in state space by the following realization,

(14)

until 3.6. Therefore, in (22), B2 was multiplied by 3.6
in order to obtain the controller H2 .
By Theorem 3 we can obtain the state feedback
H2 controller K that minimize the effect of the disturbance signal at the output of the Boost converter.
Now, we would like to place each local closed-loop
poles within an LMI sector region as shown in Figure
4. Then, a disk of radius  equal to 50000 and center in (q, 0)  (0, 0) was used. Also was considered
disturbance signals with frequency until 10 radsec.
Therefore, it is proposed the following filter,

The filters used in Theorem 3 have the goal of adjusting the H2 state-feedback controller for a selected
frequency band of the disturbance signal. However, in
the implementation or simulation of the control system, this filter is discarded.

A methodology of disturbance rejection with frequency weighted by LMIs applied to Boost converter
was proposed in this manuscript. In order to minimize
the effect of the disturbance signal in the output of the
system, was designed a state-feedback controller that
minimize the H2 -norm between the exogenous input
w(t) to the output z(t).
In this context, the use of frequency weighted allows design the control system applied in disturbance
rejection for a specific band of exogenous signal.
Simulation and implementation of the control system demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed
method. The practical application was increase the
voltage from 12V to 24V on the influence of disturbances signals and one observed that the output voltage remained regulated.
The methodology was formulated by LMI framework and, when there is a solution, can be easily solved by MATLAB environment and LMISol
(Oliveira et al., n.d.).
