Abstract State-derivative feedback can be a useful strategy for the control of mechanical systems using
accelerometers as sensors. Alternatively, when both state and state-derivative measurements are available, proportional and derivative state feedback can be employed. However, in practice, the full vectors of states and
corresponding derivatives may not be directly available. Therefore, a control law based on partial state and
state derivative measurements could be more convenient. In this context, the present paper proposes a method
for the design of a discrete-time state and state derivative feedback controller, assuming that complementary
components of the state and state derivative vectors are measured. The design is carried out in order to obtain
nominal equivalence to a given discrete-time state feedback controller. A simulation case study involving an
active mass damper system is presented for illustration.

Introduction

State derivative feedback (SDF) has been employed in various control problems, mainly involving the use of accelerometric sensors. Examples include (Duan et al., 2005 Abdelaziz, 2012
da Silva et al., 2013). In these cases, the state
variables usually comprise displacements and velocities, which would need to be estimated by integrating the acceleration measurements. However,
the accuracy of such estimates may be compromised by the presence of bias in the accelerometers, which would be an inconvenience for the implementation of conventional state feedback (SF)
control laws.
SDF has been the subject of much research
effort in the control literature. A pole placement
method for linear systems using SDF was proposed in (Abdelaziz and Valasek, 2004). Eigenstructure assignment was presented in (Abdelaziz,
2012). The design of linear quadratic regulator
(LQR) using SDF in reciprocal state space framework was described in (Duan et al., 2005). Sta-

bilizability and stability robustness of SDF controllers were investigated in (Michiels et al., 2008).
In (Basturk et al., 2015), an SDF adaptative controller was developed. Robust SDF design based
on linear matrix inequalities for uncertain systems
were proposed in (Assuncao et al., 2007), (Faria
et al., 2009),(da Silva et al., 2012).
The issue of proportional and derivative state
feedback (PDSF) has also drawn much research
attention, with studies including pole placement
(Abdelaziz, 2015), normalization and stabilization
for uncertain descriptor systems (Lin et al., 2005),
nonlinear control with exact feedback linearization
(Boukas and Habetler, 2004), decoupling of linear
systems (Chu and Malabre, 2002) and H control
for uncertain descriptor systems (Ren and Zhang,
2010), among others.
SDF formulations usually assume that all the
derivatives of the states are available for feedback,
whereas PDSF methods require both full-state
and full-derivative state measurements. However, in practice, the full state vector andor the
full derivative state vector may not be directly

available. Therefore, the combination of partial
state and state-derivative measurements may be
more convenient. Within this scope, Zhang et al.
(2014) presented a method for partial eigenstructure assignment using acceleration and displacement feedback. An extension of this formulation
was developed in (Zhang et al., 2016), using output signals consisting of linear combinations of accelerations and displacements.
In this context, the present paper proposes
a method for the design of discrete-time control
laws with complementary measurements of state
and state derivative variables. For this purpose, it
is assumed that the state components can be partitioned into two vectors x1 and x2 , with x1 and
x2 available for feedback. The proposed method
does not require measurements of the full vectors
of states andor corresponding derivatives, as in
PSDF or SDF. On the other hand, it is more general than formulations solely based on displacements and accelerations, in that various combinations of partial displacement, velocity and acceleration measurements can be employed, if available. Moreover, the discrete-time nature of the
proposed method is of value for direct implementation in digital computers. The design is carried out in order to obtain nominal equivalence
to a given discrete-time SF controller, in a similar manner as developed in (Rossi et al., 2013)
for discrete SDF controllers design. A simulation
case study involving structural vibration damping
is presented for illustration.
The remainder of this paper is organized as
follows. Section 2 presents the proposed method
for discrete-time complementary state and statederivative feedback (CSSDF) design. Section 3
introduces the case study and Section 4 shows the
results. Finally, concluding remarks are given in
Section 5.

If the full state vector x(kT ) was available for
feedback, a state feedback (SF) control law could
be implemented as
u(kT )+  Lx(kT )

(4)

with a conveniently designed gain matrix L 
Rnu nx .
The goal of this work consists of formulating a method for the design of discrete-time control laws with complementary state and statederivative feedback (CSSDF) for system (1), such
that the implemented control actions match those
provided by a given SF control law of the form
(4). For this purpose, consider that the state vector x(kT ) can be partitioned as


x1 (kT )
x(kT ) 
(5)
x2 (kT )
where x1 (kT ) and x2 (kT ) are measured.
The following theorem presents the proposed
formulation of the discrete-time CSSDF control
law.
Theorem 1 . Consider that a gain matrix L 
Rnu nx has been designed in order to obtain a
suitable SF control law of the form (4) for system
(3). Moreover, consider the state partition (5) and
an associated partition of the Ac , Bc matrices as

Proposed method


M

Consider a system described by a continuous-time
model of the form
x(t)  Ac x(t) + Bc u(t), t  R+

(1)

with the state vector x(t)  Rnx , the control input
u(t)  Rnu , and constant matrices Ac  Rnx nx ,
Bc  Rnx nu . Moreover, assume that a zero-order
hold is employed to keep the control u(t) constant
between sampling times t  kT , k  Z, i.e.
u(t)  u(kT )+ , (kT )+  t  (k + 1)T

(2)

where T is the sampling period. The superscript
+ in (2) is employed to indicate that the control
is updated immediately after the sensor measurements are acquired at each sampling time, as in
(Rossi et al., 2013). Therefore, the state equation
(1) at time t  kT can be written as
x(kT )  Ac x(kT ) + Bc u((k  1)T )+

then the control values will match those provided
by the state feedback law (4).
Proof Under the assumption that the state vector x(kT ) and the matrices Ac and Bc of the state
equation (3) are partitioned as (5) and (6), respectively, the state-derivative x2 can be written as
x2 (kT ) Ac,21 x1 (kT ) + Ac,22 x2 (kT )
+ Bc,2 u((k  1)T )+

(9)

Assuming that x1 (kT ) and x2 (kT ) are measured, the state x2 (kT ) can be obtained by reformulating equation (9) as
x2 (kT ) A1
c,22 x2 (kT )  Ac,21 x1 (kT )
 Bc,2 u((k  1)T )+

x1 (kT )
Ac,21 x1 (kT ) + Ac,22 x2 (kT ) + Bc,2 u((k  1)T )+
u((k  1)T )+
(11)
By substituting (8) in (11), it follows that


x1 (kT )
+
u(kT )  L
w(kT )

(12)

where

Therefore, it follows from (12) that


x1 (kT )

which corresponds to the control law (4).

Remark 1 . The proposed method requires the
invertibility of the Ac,22 matrix, as stated in Theorem 1. In general, the SDF formulations proposed in the literature require the invertibility of
the full Ac matrix, as can be seen for instance
in (Abdelaziz and Valasek, 2004 Assuncao et al.,
2007 Duan et al., 2005 Moreira et al., 2010).

Case study

Fig. 1 presents the active mass damper system
under consideration. It consists of a building-like
structure on top of which a cart (i.e. active mass)
is driving along a linear track to dampen out the
vibrations in the structure.

vector given by x(t)  xc xc xf xf 0 , where xc and
xc denote the position and velocity of the cart
with respect to the structure, and xf and xf denote the structures top floor deflection (i.e. the
horizontal displacement) and its velocity, respectively, and with the following Ac and Bc matrices

Moreover, the control input is the motor voltage
that drives the cart.
The challenge in designing a control system is
that the top floor deflection xf is not measured.
Instead, the top floor is instrumented with an accelerometer to measure its acceleration xf relative
to the ground. Additionaly, it is assumed that
an encoder measures the cart position xc and a
tachometer measures the cart velocity xc .
In order to investigate the convenience of using a CSSDF controller when partial states and
derivatives of other states are available for feedback, four cases were considered
 Case 1 CSSDF controller, system under
nominal conditions.
 Case 2 SF controller, system under nominal
conditions.
 Case 3 CSSDF controller, constant bias of
+1ms2 in the measured acceleration xf .
 Case 4 SF controller, constant bias as in
Case 3.
For the CSSDF controller, the partition (5)
for the state vector x(t)  x01 x02 0 was defined by
setting x1  xc xc 0 and x2  xf xf 0 , in order
to implement the control law (7). In this case, xf
is measured and xf can be estimated by using a
suitable integrating filter. On the other hand, the
SF control law (4) is based on the states x(t) 
xc xc xf xf 0 . In this case, not only xf needs to be
estimated, but also xf . Therefore, two integrating
filters are required.
In order to attenuate the effect of a sensor
bias in the integration results, the integrating filters were designed in continuous-time as a series
combination of an integrator and a high-pass filter, as follows

A discrete-time linear quadratic regulator
(DLQR) was designed as the state-feedback controller, with sampling period T  0.01s. For
this purpose, a discrete-time model of the form
x((k + 1)T )  Ax(kT ) + Bu(kT )+ was obtained
by discretizing the state equation (1), with the
matrices Ac and Bc given by (14), using the zeroorder hold method, which resulted in

The state and control weight matrices in the
DLQR design were set to Q  diag(10,10,10,10)
and R  0.1, respectively. Then, the following SF
gain matrix L was obtained

The CSSDF control law (7) was obtained by
using the M matrix in (8) with the (Ac , Bc ) matrices (14), partitioned as in (6).
In the simulations, the initial condition was
set to x(0)  0 0 0.05 00 . Moreover, a small time
delay of T 100 was introduced between sensor
readings and control update to represent AD conversion, computational processing and DA conversion at each sampling time. All simulations
were carried out by using the Matlabr Simulinkr
software, with ode4 (4th order Runge-Kutta)
solver and a fixed step size of T 1000.

Fig. 3 show the time evolution of the cart position xc , the structures top floor acceleration xf
and deflection xf and the control variables using
the CSSDF (Case 1) and the SF (Case 2) control laws in nominal operating conditions. As expected, by applying either CSSDF or SF control
laws, the controlled system presents better performance (less oscillations and decreased settling
time) for the top floor acceleration and deflection
(Fig. 3b - 3c) compared to the open loop responses
in Fig. 4. On the other hand, the SF control effort
was larger compared to CSSDF (Fig. 3d), which
resulted in a wider excursion of the cart (Fig. 3a).

eigenvalues of matrix Ac in the continuous-time
model are 0, 15.84 and 1.42  j17.00. The
oscillatory mode is associated to the complex conjugate eigenvalues, which present damping ratio
  0.08 and natural frequency n  17.1rads.
Therefore,  was chosen as   0.3s, which is
approximately five times larger than 1n . It is
worth noting that the system has small open-loop
damping (  0.08), which justifies the use of active vibration suppression.
For discrete-time implementation, the filter
F (s) was discretized by using Tustins method
(Franklin et al., 1997) with a sampling frequency
of 100Hz (T  0.01s), which is much larger than
the natural frequency n (2)  2.7Hz. As a result, the following z-domain transfer function was
obtained

In the presence of a constant bias in the measurement of xf , the simulation results by applying the CSSDF controller (Case 3) and the SF
controller (Case 4) are presented in Fig. 4. For
better clarity, the acceleration signals depicted in
Fig. 4b correspond to the actual xf values, rather
than the biased measurements employed for feedback. As can be seen, the top floor acceleration
xf (Fig. 4b) and deflection xf (Fig. 4c) responses
are similar for both controllers, without significant
differences with respect to the previous results in
Fig. 3b and Fig. 3c). However, the SF control effort is now much larger compared to CSSDF, as
shown in Fig. 4d. As a result, the cart moved
farther away from its initial position, as shown in
Fig. 4a. In practice, such an outcome would require the use of a much larger track for the cart,
which may not be compatible with the physical

dimensions of the structure. This would be a
disadvantage of the SF control law compared to
the proposed CSSDF implementation.

Conclusion

This paper proposed a method for the design
of discrete-time control laws with complementary state and state derivative feedback (CSSDF),

which is equivalent to a given discrete-time state
feedback (SF) controller. A simulation case study
involving the use of a moving cart as an active
mass damper on top of a flexible structure was presented. In this case, the SF control law required
the use of two integrating filters to estimate the
velocity and displacement of the structure from
the acceleration measurements. In contrast, the
proposed CSSDF control law required only one
integrating filter. As a result, the CSSDF control
effort and the associated excursion of the moving
cart were much smaller compared with SF, especially in the presence of bias in the acceleration
measurements. Future studies could be concerned
with the analysis of robustness of the CSSDF
controller compared to the SF controller, in the
presence of mismatch between the design model
and the actual plant dynamics.
