1 Introduction
and experimental results respectively. The Section 7
concludes the paper.

As is well known the ZETA DC-DC is a fourthorder PWM DC-DC converter. Topologically the
ZETA converter has two inductors and two capacitors. It is capable of operating in either step-down or
step-up mode. The ZETA converter has its main
switch in series with the input power supply, because
of this characteristic this converter is subject to
greater levels of stress in the input current than other
basic fourth-order PWM DC-DC converters like Cuk
or SEPIC converters. Therefore, this converter has
received less attention than SEPIC and Cuk converters. For example, at this moment, an accurate analytical model for this converter operating in DCM is not
available. However, this converter has some characteristics that make its application attractive, as
described by Lopez (2009) and Peres (1994).
Depending on the simulation environment and the
modeling method, a small-signal model of converter
given as a functional block diagram could be more
suitable than a complex analytical model or equivalent circuit model. E.g., in MATLABTM, a simple
functional block that contains the control-to-output
behavior is adequate for developing a control strategy
using PI-type controllers.
This paper presents a dynamic computer simulation
model for the ZETA converter working in DCM suitable to work with MATLABTM. This paper is organized as follows. The operation of the ZETA converter
working in DCM is presented in Section 2. The technique employed to obtain the computational model is
discussed in Section 3. The model is presented in
Section 4. Sections 5 and 6 present the simulation
results

2 ZETA Converter in DCM
The ZETA converter is a fourth-order structure,
similar to the SEPIC converter. The converter topology is shown in Figure 1.

2.1 Stages of Operation
The stages of operation of the ZETA converter
connected to the load will be analyzed further from
the assumption that all semiconductors are ideal.
In DCM this converter presents three stages of operation, represented schematically in Figure 2.
First stage (0 < t < tc) The switch S is closed and the
voltage vg is applied to inductors Lm and Lo. The currents iLm and iLo grow linearly with slopes vg Lm and
vg Lo, respectively. Thus, the current in the switch S,
which is the sum of currents iLm and iLo, grows at the
rate of vg Leq, where Leq is the equivalent parallel
inductance. The diode is reverse polarized and remains blocked throughout this stage.

3 Generalized Switch Averaging

Figure 2. (a) First, (b) second and (c) third stages of operation of
the DC-DC ZETA converter operating in DCM.

The state-space averaging (SSA) technique was
first proposed by Middlebrook and Cuk (1977), and
previously used successfully in the analysis of the
ZETA converter in continuous conduction mode
(CCM) by Eng (2008) and for SEPIC converter in
DCM by Eng (2009). This method can be extended
to the DCM, but in this case it is less accurate, because the converter transfer function is dependent of
the load, as presented by Erickson (1997). Another
aspect, according to Sun (2001), it is that only the
coefficients of the matrices are averaged, and not
necessarily the state variables themselves. However,
as Erickson (1997) presents, it is possible to use the
Generalized Switch Averaging technique, where
well-known models derived from CCM (including
SSA model) may be used in DCM analysis, by including an additional switching network to the model
through feedback. Figure 4 illustrates this concept. In
Figure 4, u(t) are the independent inputs of the converter. y(t) are the converter outputs. us(t) are the
inputs of the switch network. ys(t) is the output of the
switch network. Finally, the input uc(t) are all the
converter control inputs.

Second stage (tc < t < tc + td) The switch S is open
and the diode enters into conduction. The voltage vo
is applied to inductors Lm and Lo. Lm transfers the
energy stored in the previous step for the coupling
capacitor C, in a similar way Lo enables the connection to the load, acting as a voltage source. The currents iLm and iLo decrease linearly with slope vo Lm
and vo Lo, respectively. The current iD is the sum of
the currents iLm and iLo, and decreases linearly with
slope vo Leq. The end of this stage is characterized
by the decrease of the current in the diode until zero.
Third stage (tc + td < t < T) The switch S remains
open and the diode is as well open because of the
extinction of its current iD. The coupling capacitor
current iC is constant and equal to the output inductor
current Lo (iLo), which has the opposite direction of
the magnetizing inductor current Lm (iLm), causing the
voltage at the inductors to be equal zero. The main
ZETA converter waveforms (in DCM) within a high
frequency period are shown in Figure 3.
2.2 Static Transfer Characteristic
According to Martins and Barbi (2008), the instantaneous static gain g(t) of the ZETA converter in
DCM can be expressed by (1). The conduction time
of the diode (tD) is constant when there is no variation
of the load R in DCM. This characteristic implies in a
linear relationship between the input and output.

Generally, converters have only one controllable input. This input is usually the duty cycle of the converter d(t). It is desirable to express us(t) as a function
only of the state variables x(t) and of the independent
inputs of the converter u(t), but this task is not possi-

3.2 Time-Invariant Network

ble in some cases, as will be presented further in this
paper.
The main objective of this technique is to use an
available time-invariant model obtained in CCM
analysis to study power converters in DCM. To
achieve this goal, the control input d(t) in DCM must
be substituted by an equivalent control input in CCM
ys(t). This transformation will be presented in the next
section of this paper.

In this paper, the Time-Invariant Network is a
SSA model of the ZETA converter working in CCM,
obtained by the method proposed by Middlebrook
and Cuk (1977). Considering the converter shown in
Figure 1, it can be represented in state-space by (8).

3.1 Switch Network

Aa  A1  (t ) + A2 (1   (t ) )

The switch network method is based on the averaged switch modeling approach, as stated by Vorperian (1989) and in the loss-free resistor model,
proposed by Singer (1990). Figure 5 illustrates these
models.

(a)

Ba  B1  (t ) + B2 (1   (t ) )

C a  C1  (t ) + C 2 (1   (t ) )

The state variables x(t) are the inductor currents and
the capacitor voltages. In this model, u(t) contains the
independent inputs of the power converter, such as
the input voltage vg(t) and, in some cases, the output
current. (t) is the switch conversion ratio. The indexed matrices in (9) are the matrices that describe
the behavior of the state variables and the output y(t)
at the correspondent stage of operation. These matrices will be presented further in the sequence of this
paper.
The small-signal AC model is obtained by perturbation and linearization of (8). The system perturbations are presented in (10).

It is possible to correlate the input and output parameters of the loss-free resistor model by the switch
conversion ratio (t).

First it is necessary to define the system inputs.
The converter of Figure 1 has one control input and
one independent input, as described in (17).

The input variables of the switch network can be
found by redrawing the converter of Figure 1.

obtain the following equalities

From the second stage  Figure 2.(b), results,

The equations (20) and (21) are equivalent and all the
variables are time-varying. They express the relationship between the state variables of the time-invariant
network x(t), the control input of the converter d(t),
and the switch conversion ratio (t). The state variables are usually the inductors currents and the capacitors voltages. However (20) and (21) depend not
only on state variables but also depend on the derivatives of the state variables vC(t), iLm(t) and iLo(t).

By substituting the matrices of (28) into (13), the
averaged matrices are found. It is possible to obtain a
small-signal AC model for the ZETA converter (12),
at the desired operating point, from (11) inasmuch as
the feedback of the linearized gains (24) and (25) are
taking into account. The control-to-output AC model
can now be presented. This model is shown in Figure
7.

7 Conclusions
In this paper was presented a new dynamic computer simulation model for the ZETA converter
working in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM).
Even under the limitations of SSA on the DCM
analysis, the mathematical model obtained evinced
several similarities with the simulated system. It was
shown that the dynamic characteristic of the converter almost does not change with changes in duty
cycle, facilitating the development of control strategy. The obtained results support the proposal. The
dynamic simulation model accuracy allows using the
proposed model in numeric softwares reducing the
simulation time. In complex power systems where
many converters are used, this kind of tool could be
very useful.
