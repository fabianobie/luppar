1. Introduction
Phase-locked loop (PLL) algorithms have been of
great interest and with a large area of application in
the
electrical
engineering
field,
e.g.
telecommunication systems, motor drives, reactive
power compensation, current and voltage control in
power
conditioning
equipment,
as
UPSs
(Uninterruptible Power Systems), dynamic voltage
restorer, distributed generation,
and others
(Rodriguez,2002), (Silva,2000-2004). In modern
applications of power electronics to power systems,
PLLs are designed to deliver estimation of phase,
frequency and amplitude of an input signal, even
under disturbances or reference signal variations,
Fig.1. Recently, there has been an increasing interest
in the development and application of PLL techniques
in three-phase and single-phase grid-connected
systems (Blasko,1997), (Karimi, 2004).
In previous works
(Karimi, 2002-2004), a
combination of single-phase PLLs is used to allow
synchronization with a three-phase system, while in
others, three-phase PLL structures are adapted for
single-phase grid-connected applications (Silva,20002004). This last approach has obtained a meaningful
success assigning that for each three phase PLL
structure there is a possibility of a single phase
adaptation.
In this work, an analysis and investigation of the
utilization of a three-phase PLL structure known as
Double-Synchronous Reference Frame PLL (DSRFPLL) in single-phase grid-connected application is
presented. The DSRF-PLL, introduced in

(Rodriguez,2002) has proved to be very attractive
and reliable for three-phase systems under
unbalances, such as harmonic distortion, voltage sags
and other distorted utility conditions. The basic
principle of operation of the DSRF-PLL consists of
the decomposition of three-phase input signals into
the positive and negative components. Then, these
signals are applied in a structure capable of
decoupling the effects of one sequence in to the other.
In the next section, the structure and principle of
operation of the DSRF-PLL is briefly reviewed,
focusing on its application to single-phase systems. In
the following section, some single-phase PLL
methods are presented for comparison with the
proposed technique. Simulation results of all methods
under distorted utility conditions are presented. In the
final version of this paper, results obtained through an
experimental setup, based on a Freescale, 16-bits
Digital Signal Processor (DSP) are also included to
allow a better and practical evaluation of the DSRFPLL for single-phase applications.
2. Structure of the DSRF-PLL
Fig.2 shows a block diagram representation of the
DSRF-PLL (Rodriguez,2002). As it can be seen, the
three-phase signal, represented by vector Vabc pass

parameter in the Park transformation blocks and in
the decoupling structures.
This technique, proposed in (Rodriguez,2002),
presents accurate tracking performance from a variety
of distortions in three-phase applications, such as
voltage unbalance, frequency variation, harmonic
distortion, and voltage sags, etc.
This section introduced and briefly explained the
DSRF-PLL for three-phase applications. In the next
section, it is shown the evaluation of its use for singlephase grid-connected applications.

3. Using DSRF-PLL for Single-Phase
Synchronization
The main idea behind using the DSRF-PLL for
single-phase applications is based on the fact that a
pulsating field, as found in single-phase induction
machines, can be thought as produced by two equal
fields, rotating in opposite directions (Domijan,1994).
With this idea in mind, one can think of the voltage of
a single-phase system as the resultant voltage from the
interaction of two equal and opposite voltage vectors,
one in the clockwise direction and the other in the
counter-clockwise.
The three-phase DSRF-PLL structure contains a
Clark transformation which gives the V and V
components. To adapt this method to a single-phase
case, this transformation can be removed and the
input signal can be assumed as being equal to V.
Signal V is considered equal to zero. The results of
this assumption are presented in the following
development.
First, the input signal is considered as

in eq. (1).

The transformation gives the V and V components,
which go through two Park transformation matrices,
one for the positive sequence (Tdq+) and one for the
negative sequence (Tdq-), as shown in eq. (2) and (3),
respectively.

where  is the estimated phase. The index   
denotes an estimation, while  *  denotes reference.
Thereafter, the resultant signals are applied to the
decoupling structure, illustrated in Fig.3, whose
objective is to eliminate the oscillating effect of one
sequence into the other (Rodriguez,2002).
The output signals of the decoupling structure pass
through low-pass filters to allow the extraction of the
positive and negative sequence amplitudes that can be
used as feedback signals to these structures.
Information on frequency of the input signal can be
obtained by passing the v*Sq+1 signal through a
Proportional and Integral controller (PI), which is
responsible for making the generated reference frames
synchronize with the input voltage vector. The
estimated phase is obtained by integrating the
estimated frequency and then used as an input

where  is the estimated phase. After the decoupling
structures, one can have

and assuming  , one can have

The information about frequency and phase is
obtained just like in the three-phase DSRF-PLL,
through a PI and an integrator, respectively.
Considering V equal to the reference signal and V
equal to zero, an adaptation of the DSRF-PLL is
proposed for single-phase application.
Fig.4(a) shows a schematic diagram representation
of the DSRF-PLL implemented in MatlabSimulink
for extraction of information from a single-phase
input signal. Fig.4 (b)-(e) show the frequency, phase
angle, amplitude and reference signal estimated by the
PLL, respectively. A good agreement between the
estimated and the reference signal can be observed in
Fig. 4 (e).
In the next section some other single-phase PLL
methods are presented to allow a performance
comparison with the results generated by the DSRFPLL, especially in distorted utility applications.

Transport Delay-Based(TDB-PLL)(Silva,2000).



A. Enhanced PLL (EPLL)
The EPLL, illustrated in Fig. 5, consists basically
of a Phase Detector (PD), a Loop Filter (LF) and a
Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) (Karimi, 20022004). This technique works effectively to track the
input signal u(t), obtaining information on the
amplitude (A), the frequency (0) and the phase (),
along with the output signal y(t).
It is shown (Karimi, 2002-2004) that the EPLL can
be successfully used for peak (voltage) detection and
extraction of total harmonic content of a signal,
detection and extraction of individual components of
a signal, reactive current extraction, disturbance
detection, noise reduction in zero-crossing, voltage
flicker detection and so on.

B. Inverse Park Based PLL (IPB-PLL)
The IPB-PLL, shown in Fig.6 (Silva,2000-2004),
makes use of the Park (from  to dq) and an inverse
Park (from dq to ) transformations to internally
generate a V in quadrature with the single-phase
input signal, V. The d component is used in the
control loop to obtain an estimation of the frequency
and phase of the input signal. The q component
represents the estimated amplitude. The first order
low pass filter, before the inverse Park transformation
is used to introduce an energy storage element in the
internal feedback loop.
In (Silva, 2000-2004) it is shown that this PLL
algorithm allows the extraction of the required
information from the input signal, even for input
signals with high harmonic content.

Fig. 7. TDB-PLL structure.

The TDB-PLL has an efficient operation and is
simple to implement. However, depending on the
sampling frequency, the delay block would require a
great piece of memory of the processor. This is
assumed taking into account the need of a series of
variables to store the reference signal value and apply
it with a delay time corresponding to 90 degrees of
the fundamental frequency. Besides, assuming a non
adaptive time delay, its performance under frequency
variations can be affected. As can be noticed, the
DSRF-PLL does not need a time delay, having an
advantage over this method.

C. Time Delay Based (TDB-PLL)
The TDB-PLL, shown in Fig.7 (Silva,2000), uses a
time delay corresponding to 90 phase shift of the
fundamental frequency to generate a signal (V), in
quadrature with the reference input signal V. Similar
to the IPB-PLL method, the d component is used in
the control PI loop to obtain the frequency and phase
of the signal, while the q component represents the
estimated amplitude.
It is shown that this technique (Silva,2000-2004),
compared with the IPB-PLL, presents an improved
performance, higher robustness and simpler
implementation algorithm, as compared with the IPBPLL.

6. Simulation Results
In this section, some comparative analysis of
simulation the results are presented, concerning the
methods DSRF-PLL, EPLL, IPB-PLL and TDB-PLL.
The parameters used in the simulation are described
in Table 1. In all simulations, the input voltage
amplitude is 180V and the frequency is 60Hz.

5. Advantages of DSRF-PLL Compared to the
Other Algorithms
Although the DSRF-PLL algorithm appears to be
more complex, compared to the other methods, it can
be implemented with few command lines. In addition,
the necessary changes to adapt this method for singlephase applications are minimal. Compared to the
other methods, the DSRF-PLL has many advantages,
as discussed bellow.
In comparison with the EPLL, it is not specific for
one target frequency, and can be programmed also for
harmonics, in a structure named Multiple
Synchronous Reference Frame PLL (MSRF-PLL).
Compared to the IPB-PLL, it is simpler to
implement since there is no need to internally
generate a signal in quadrature with the input signal.
Instead, it is only necessary to enter the input signal
and set the complementary signal to zero.

Fig.8 shows the performance of each PLL method
with 11 of third, 4 fifth and 2 of seventh
harmonic distortion. It can be noticed that all
compared methods appear to have a similar
performance. Although, comparing the Total
4

Harmonic Distortion (THD) of the PLL outputs, when
tracking an input signal with a THD equal to 12.02,
it results in 2.82, 1.67, 9.52 and 8.64 for the
DSRF-PLL,
EPLL,
IPB-PLL,
TDB-PLL,
respectively. Thus, compared with the other methods,
the DSRF-PLL has a good tracking capability, which
is slightly overcome only by the EPLL.
Fig.9 shows the performance of all methods
against a 50 voltage sag. As can be noticed, all PLL
output follows closely the input signal. However, the
best performances are observed in IPB-PLL and
TDB-PLL, which follows precisely the input signal
during the start and the end of the voltage sag. As can
be seen, the phase estimation appears to not suffer
any significant disturbance during the fault.
Fig.10 shows the performance of all methods under
5 of voltage fluctuation. As can be noticed, all the
outputs appear to have the same performance.
However, the average error between the input and the
output is around 0.8, 1.14, 0.36 and 0.27 for
DSRF-PLL, EPLL, IPB-PLL and TDB- PLL,
respectively. Although all the errors are considerable
small, for flicker mitigation these results are of major
importance since even a 0.3 voltage fluctuation
implies flicker levels higher enough to cause
perceptible visual discomfort. Thus, the error of the
DSRF-PLL is comparable with the other methods.
Fig.11 shows the performances of all methods
during a phase angle jump of 45 in the input signal.
As can be noticed, all methods have fast track
response after the disturbance.
Fig.12 shows the phase error of all PLL methods
with an ideal sinusoidal signal as input. As can be
noticed, the DSRF- PLL has fast and accurate
tracking compared to the other methods. The transient
for tracking of the DSRF-PLL is approximated the
other PLL algorithms, and its maximum error is
significantly bigger than the other over the transient
period.

7. Experimental Results
Fig.13 shows the implementation results of the
DSRF-PLL in a Freescale MC56F8037 DSP, where
the upper channel is the input signal and the lower
channel the output of the PLL (phase, amplitude or
sine wave). Fig.13 (a-b) shows the estimated phase
and voltage for an ideal sinusoidal input. Fig.13 (c-d)
shows the estimation of phase and amplitude of the
PLL under voltage sag. Fig. 13 (e) shows the phase
estimation under a high harmonic distortion. Fig.13
(f) shows the estimation of phase during frequency
variation. As it can be noticed, experimental
implementation presents good performance and
precise estimation during a variety of disturbances.
Thus, the algorithm has a good operation when
experimentally implemented, what gives support to
the application of the DSRF-PLL in single phase
systems.

8. Conclusions
In this work, the applicability of the DSRF-PLL in
single-phase grid connected systems was studied. The
operation of the proposed approach was compared
with other PLL methods in the literature through
simulation results, presenting similar performance
related to these methods. The simulation results
obtained of the DSRF-PLL show the good operation
of the algorithm even when subjected to extremely
high voltage disturbances, as voltage sag, harmonics,
voltage fluctuation and phase- shift. Experimental
results were presented matching the expected
behavior shown in the computational simulations.
