Abstract Nonlinear systems identification is a research topic of great interest in several fields, such as Economics, Electrical and Control Engineering. Therefore, this paper pursues the identification of a buck converter
through the orthonormal basis functions of Laguerre and Kautz. In order to evaluate the coefficients of the
functions, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed. This GA uses the Nelder Mead algorithm and the Least Mean
Square method as local optimizers during the search process. A comparison between the models obtained from
each of the orthonormal basis is presented. Moreover, the functionality of the proposal is proved through the
comparison between the proposed GA and a classic GA.

(HEUBERGER et al., 2005). On the other hand,
the functions of Kautz usually obtain better performance in modeling underdamped dynamical
systems (MACHADO et al., 2010).

Introduction

The use of orthonormal basis functions in dynamic_systems identification is widely found in
literature (CAMPELLO et al., 2007 HEUBERGER et al., 2005 MACHADO et al., 2010 ROSA
et al., 2009). Among these functions, the classic functions of Laguerre and Kautz are the most
used. The combination of these functions, parameterized by different poles, is known as Generalized Orthonormal Functions and it constitutes an appealing alternative for the identification of systems whose dynamic is more complex
(HEUBERGER et al., 2005).
The final objective of this paper is the identification of a real Buck converter using the discrete
orthonormal functions of Laguerre and Kautz, implemented as digital filters. In order to accomplish
this goal, first a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed. The novelty in this algorithm is the use of
the Nelder Mead, NM, algorithm and the Least
Mean Square, LMS, method as local optimizers
in order to obtain the parameters of the model.
These local optimizers are expected to accelerate
the convergence of the optimization problem as
well as to obtain more accurate solutions for the
identification problem.
The functions of Laguerre are better suitable to model systems with poles purely real

The orthonormal basis functions approach is
interesting due to two key aspects first, the knowledge of past terms of the input and output signals is not necessary and, second, there is no output feedback, therefore, there is no propagation of
recursion errors (CAMPELLO et al., 2007).
Identification process aim to find a model for a
system, based on empirical data (LJUNG, 1999).
This could be a very complex problem, depending
on how difficult is to finding the derivatives, Jacobian and Hessian matrix of the system. Thus, the
use of heuristic methods is appealing.
This paper is organized as follows Section
2 explains the basic concepts of dynamic_systems
identification and presents some simulations in order to illustrate the application of orthonormal
basis functions. Then, in section 3, the functionality of the proposed method is shown through
the identification of a real Buck converter. Section 4 presents a comparison between the results
obtained and, finally, section 5 gives the main conclusions of this work.

seen in figure 1.

This section presents a discussion of the identification of simulated linear systems. The identification was based on Laguerre and Kautz functions.
The main goal is to show how these functions can
be employed in the identification of dynamic_systems.

In the case of Linear Time-Invariant (LTI)
systems, the operator H can be defined as

In order to exemplify the concept of modeling
a LTI system with Laguerre functions, regard the
following stable LTI system sampled at a rate of
50 ms

where m and n are orthonormal functions and
h.i is an inner product, proper to those continuous functions, defined by equation (2) as given by

The main orthonormal functions are the Hermit, Jacobi, Laguerre, Legendre, Kautz and
the generalized orthonormal functions (GOBF),
(WILLEM BELT, 1997). In the next subsection,
the orthonormal functions employed in this paper
are presented.
2.1.1

Figura 2 Step response of system with real poles
As can be seen in figure 2, the system response
presents no overshoot. As already mentioned, Laguerre functions perform better in modeling underdamped systems. Thus, it can be concluded
that Laguerre functions are the most suitable for
representing this system.
In order to identify the model, a simulation
was performed. The input to that simulation was
a PRBS (Pseudo Random binary Sequence) with
128 samples.
As a result, a model, MnL (z), based on linear
combinations of n Laguerre functions was obtained. This model approximates the system described in equation (6).

Laguerre Functions

Laguerre functions are parameterized by a real
pole (ROSA et al., 2009 LEMMA et al., 2010),
and they can be expressed by

where p is the pole of the Laguerre functions and
z is the complex variable associated with the Z
transform. The functions of a Laguerre basis can
be implemented in the form of filters, so that each

2.1.2

Kautz Functions

The Kautz functions are parameterized by a complex pole (CAMPELLO et al., 2007 LEMMA
et al., 2010). These functions can be expressed
by the equations (8) and (9).

Kautz functions, respectively.  and  are the poles that parameterize these functions. The terms

In figure 3, the simulation of the linear model
obtained through the combination of 3 Laguerre
functions is shown. The PRBS input is applied
to the original system (5) and to the model. The
output of the system is presented in continuous

order to obtain this result, the GA proposed in
this paper was used. Section 3.2 presents details
of this algorithm. The best result, represented

The step response of the system (12), presented in figure 4, shows the underdamped nature of
this system, 0 <  < 1, being  the dumping ratio.
Such systems can be well represented by combining linear Kautz functions (ROSA et al., 2009).
In the same way as given for system (5), the system (12) was fed with 128 samples of a PRBS
input.
Since the system is linear, we can easily obtain
a model, Mnk (z), that represents it, by a linear
combination of n Kautz functions

Identification of a Real Buck
Converter

Real systems usually present nonlinear components and inputoutput signals perturbed by
noise. In this section, the identification of the
Buck circuit depicted in figure 6 is described.

Through the application of the proposed GA,
the parameterizing pole and the coefficients of the
functions can be determined. The result provided
by the GA is shown in figure 5.

Figura 6 DC-DC Buck converter.
The input of this circuit is applied at the
gate, G, of the MOSFET, Metal-Oxide Field Effect Transistor. The signal used as input is a Duty
Cycle, D, modulated in a square wave. The output of this circuit, Vo , is defined as the voltage
over the resistor RL .
In order to obtain a continuous operation from
the conversor, a period of T  30 ms was employed in the input signal. Thus, the current in
the inductor is never equal to zero and the continuous operation is achieved.
In the converter, when D  1 the voltage at
the load, Vo , rises because the switch T1 is closed, allowing the source Vd to energize the path
given by the capacitor and the inductor. On the
other hand, when D  0, the switch T1 opens
and Vo reduces according to a dynamic behavior
different from the previously described, pointing
out the nonlinear characteristic of this converter
(AGUIRRE, 2007).
The identification of a system requires the
acquisition of the input and output data of the
system. In this work, the data acquisition was
made with a microcontroller MBED, ARM R family Cortex M3, 32 bits architecture and Clock
frequency of 96 MHz.
All the procedures necessary to the identification were executed in the software Matlab, version 2013. The communication between the software and the microcontroller was established through the RS-232 serial protocol, with a rate of
9600 kbps. An ADC, Analog-to-Digital Converter, with 16 bits, internal to the microcontroller
was used in order to read the analog signals from
the Buck converter.
The experimental setup used to acquire the
inputoutput data from the Buck converter can
be seen in figure 7.
In order to accomplish the identification of the
proposed systems, linear and nonlinear combina-

persistently excitatory. A signal is said to be persistently excitatory when its components are able
to sweep all the space of the parameters (NOWAC
and VAN VEEN, 1993). With this in mind, the
signal given in figure 9d was generated by summing the signals of figures 9a (low frequencies),
9b (medium frequencies) and 9c (high frequencies). Hence, the resulting signal is called PRMLS,
Pseudo Random Multilevel Sequence and it is better suited for the identification of nonlinear_systems.

tions of Laguerre and Kautz functions were used.
These functions were implemented as digital filters on the frequency domain. For the purpose of
treating the system s nonlinearity a polynomial
block is applied on the output of the linear model. This structure is known as Wiener model, as
depicted in figure 8.

3.2

In this section, the main aspects of the proposed
Genetic Algorithm, GA, employed to identify the
Buck converter, of figure 6, are detailed.

Figura 8 Wiener Model - nonlinearity at the output.

3.2.1

Wiener models use a cascade composition of
dynamic linear models, M (k), followed by a static
nonlinear function, f (.), (AGUIRRE, 2007). It is
important to mention that the nonlinear degree of
each output of the orthonormal filter is independent from each other.

The gene codification applied in this work can be
represented as follows

where c1 , c2 ,    , cn are the orthonormal function
coefficients and a + bi is the parameterizing pole
of this functions.
For each of the n orthonormal functions, we
have n genes representing the nonlinearity of the
output filters. These genes are given by

Input Signals

Since the DCDC system shown in figure 6 is
nonlinear, it is necessary that the excitation signal presents variations in frequency and amplitude in order to provide a effective identification
(AGUIRRE, 2007). Thus, summation of PRBS
signals was used with different spectral composition, as it can be seen in figure 9.
The frequency band of the excitation signal
determines the range in which the system characteristics could be found by the identification procedure (NEMETH and KOLLAR, 2002).
In this scenario, the input signal needs to be

values 0, 1 or 2. The effect that the genes produce
is described in table (1).

fect normally produced by the mutation operator
(KOZA, 1998).
In the proposed GA, two local search operators have been introduced the NM algorithm and
the LMS method. A detailed description of NM
can be found in (NELDER and MEAD, 1965).
The LMS is described in the next subsection.

can be seen in figure 1. In this figure, Laguerre
functions are the components of the orthonormal
basis function.
It is worth to point out that the chosen model
does not apply the nonlinearity on the input vector, u(k) (Hammerstein Model). It applies the
nonlinearity on the orthonormal filtered output
signals (Wiener Model), as it can be seen in figure 8.
Assuming, for example, that it would be convenient for the data fitting to consider a 2nd degree of nonlinearity on the Laguerre filter output
(see figure 1), then the vector l1 (k) would have
their elements squared by the mapping H. The
same procedure is applied to the other orthonormal filter outputs. For instance, when identifying
a linear system, the genes gn tend to converge to
0 or 1.

Least Squares Operator

The Least Mean Squares (LMS) is one of the pioneers and most used methods in systems identification, (LJUNG, 1999). In this paper, this
method is applied as an operator of a Genetic Algorithm. In other words, this operator applies the
LMS, given by equation (15), to randomly chosen
chromosomes.

The fitness employed here is the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the measured circuit
output and the output estimated by the approximate model. In the GA, the mutation and crossover ratios varies with respect to the given generation. The crossover rate starts with 80 focusing on local searches, and then it is progressively
reduced during the optimization process. On the
other hand, the mutation starts at 20, and it is
increased as the generation number increases, focusing on global searches. It is worth to mention
that the mutation rate usually found in the literature seldom are greater than 10. In this work,
much higher rates were applied due to the use of
a mutation operator based on the disturbance of
the gene. This disturbance consists on adding a
small random constant to a given gene. Thus, the
result is the reduction of the random search ef-

the regression matrix (composed by input signals
filtered by the orthonormal functions). It is important to mention that, despite the name, the
matrix , in this work, has no regressive versions of the input signal, u(k), it has only filtered
versions of u(k) .
For instance, if the Laguerre basis were used,
the genes related to the poles, in a chromosome,
would generate the Laguerres functions and the
matrix  would be composed of filtered versions
of the input vector u(k), as is exposed in equation

Using the equation (15) one can obtain the

worth to mention that the pole that parameterize
the orthonormal function is not changed by this
operator.
After using the LMS operator, some genes of
the chosen chromosomes will be replaced by the
elements of the vector .
This operator will be used by the GA after
each 7 generations in order to avoid the premature
convergence to a local minimum.

Conclusion

In this paper, the identification of nonlinear_systems based on Laguerre and Kautz functions was
discussed. In order to pursue this identification,
the model and structure parameters were evaluated by minimizing the MSE between the measured
output of the circuit and the output estimated by
the approximated model. The main contribution
of this paper was the proposal of a new GA with
two local search operators the NM algorithm and
the LMS method. Based on the results, presented
in section 5, it can be concluded that the Laguerre
and Kautz functions provided very similar results
for the case studied, with sensitive better performance for function of Kautz. More importantly,
the GA with NM and LMS operators not only
converged much faster than the classical GA, but
also was able to provide a much more accurate
approximated model.
As future work, the use of Genetic Programming can be seen as a good option to determine
the degree of nonlinearity of the system and also
to obtain the parameters of the nonlinear system.
