Abstract The present paper deals with the waypoint-based guidance of a multirotor aerial vehicle in the
presence of a bounded wind disturbance. A discrete-time quasi-sliding mode control (SMC) strategy is adopted,
which assures finite-time stability to the guidance. In the proposed control loop, the position command is
transmitted to the controller as a sequence of tridimensional waypoints. The current waypoint of the sequence is
detected as soon as the vehicle enters inside a virtual sphere centered at it. At this moment, the next waypoint
commanded is made active. This switching-waypoint rule is repeated until the final waypoint is activated, at
which the vehicle is commanded to hover. The finite-time stability is assured by the reaching law of SMC, which
keeps the multirotors position close to the next waypoint of the reference trajectory. The resulting control law
is simple to implement in an embedded real-time system. The proposed method is evaluated on computational
simulations and trajectories very close to the reference were achieved, proving its efficiency and robustness against
a bounded random wind disturbance.

Resumo Este artigo lida com o problema de guiamento  de veculos aereos multirotores na
presenca de um disturbio de vento. A fim de solucionar o problema, propoe-se a formulacao de um controlador
por modos_deslizantes em tempo_discreto. A entrada de comando para o controlador consiste em uma sequencia
de waypoints tridimensionais. Um waypoint e detectado assim que o veculo entra em uma esfera virtual com
centro neste ponto e raio especificado. No mesmo instante, o algoritmo ja passa a buscar o proximo waypoint da
trajetoria. Essa regra e repetida ate que o veculo alcance o ultimo waypoint, onde ele e comandado a manter-se
em voo pairado. A regra de aproximacao utilizada garante ao sistema estabilidade_em_tempo_finito, o que implica
que a posicao do robo e levada e mantida numa regiao em torno do proximo waypoint da trajetoria de referencia.
A lei de controle resultante e simples de ser embarcada em um sistema fsico em tempo_real. O metodo proposto e
avaliado em simulacoes computacionais e foram obtidas trajetorias muito proximas a referencia, o que comprova
sua eficiencia e robustez contra uma perturbacao aleatoria e limitada de vento.

Introduction

Waypoint-based guidance for multirotor aerial vehicles (MAV) is already a popular technology, being available even in open-sourceopen-hardware
autopilots systems, such as the Mission PlannerArdupilot Mega. Basically, it consists in controlling the position of a vehicle so as to make
it approximately pass through desired positions,
which we call waypoints.
Many papers have investigated the waypointbased guidance, however considering other types
of autonomous vehicles (Petersen et al., 2013
Lenain et al., 2006 Almeida, 2008 Bousson and
Machado, 2013 Richards and How, 2002). The
paper (Nagaty et al., 2013) used a nonlinear
control technique to solve the multirotor trajectory tracking problem. In this work, the outer
loop controller generates the reference trajectories for the inner loop controller in order to reach
the desired waypoint. More recently, (Santos
et al., 2015) treated the problem of waypointbased guidance an MAV using a model predictive
controller (MPC) and introduced a strategy for
avoidance of a static obstacle. This technique is
able to respect constraints on the vehicles posi-

tion and thrust vector during the guidance mission. The present paper proposes a method based
on the sliding model control (SMC) strategy for
waypoint-based guidance of an MAV subject to a
bounded wind disturbance. Different of the MPC
method investigated in (Santos et al., 2015), the
proposed control law assures robustness against
bounded disturbances.
The remaining text is organized in the following manner. Section 2 enunciates the waypointbased multirotor guidance problem. Section 3
presents a sliding mode controller for solving the
guidance problem defined in Section 2. Section 4
shows the simulation results. Finally, Section 5
presents the concluding remarks.

Problem Definition

Consider a quadrotor and two Cartesian Coordinate Systems (CCS) (see Figure 1). The body
CCS SB  XB , YB , ZB  is fixed on the vehicles
frame at its center of mass (CM). The ground CCS
SG  XG , YG , ZG  is fixed at a known point O
on Earth. For simplicity, the time dependence of
all vectors will be omitted from now on.

by (Bartoszewicz, 1998).

Assume that SG is an inertial frame. In this
case, an immediate application of the second Newtons law gives the following dynamics model for

In order to obtain the design model, consider the
following assumption.

Let F  R3 denote the
thrust command computed by the guidance law
defined in Problem 1. Assume that there is no
deviation between this command and the real
thrust force, i.e., FcG  F.

known before-hand. Therefore, define the reference trajectory r for the vehicles flight as the
sequence of line segments linking the waypoints,
as illustrated in Figure 2.

Consider that, at a certain instant k, the current
waypoint of the vehicles flight is wj . Also, we define the discrete time kj  Z+ at which the waypoint wj is detected by the system. Initially, we
set j  1 and k0  0.
Before presenting the waypoint detection rule,
define a waypoint detection sphere Bwj ()  R3
as an Euclidean ball centered at wj , with radius
  R+ , and consider that from now on,  will be
called the waypoint detection radius. Therefore,
as soon as the following condition is verified

the waypoint wj is detected and the system starts
to pursuit the next waypoint wj+1 . This rule is
repeated up to the last waypoint wq . At this
moment, the parameter kj is set as the current
time k and the reference state vector is updated

Computation of the Commands to the Plant

As soon as the control input vector uk is calculated, it can be converted into the corresponding
thrust command F by using equation (5). However, this force command is not sufficient as an
output of a guidance law for a multirotor aerial vehicle. In fact, the system has to provide two commands for the quadrotors internal control loop
a reference for the magnitude of the total thrust
vector and an attitude reference. The complete
explanation of how these commands are calculated
by the controller can be found in (Prado and Santos, 2014).

System Simulation

The proposed guidance system is simulated in
MATLABSimulink with a six-degree-of-freedom
dynamics model of attitude and position, considering a quadrotor in plus configuration with the
parameters listed in Table 1.
In the (internal) attitude_control loop, a saturated proportional-derivative control law with
proportional gain Kp  40 and derivative gain
Kd  2 is used. On the other hand, in the (external) position control loop, the SMC proposed in
Section 3 is adopted. Table 2 presents the SMC
parameters used in the simulations.
The disturbance force FdG is chosen to simulate a moderate wind.
It is modeled by
a zero-mean Gaussian noise trucated by the
bounds established in (3), with covariance Q 
diag(0.01, 0.01, 0.005625).

Simulation results

The proposed guidance strategy is evaluated in
the simulation of a complete mission, with takeoff, tracking of some given waypoints and landing. So, at the start time, the quadrotor rests at
point O and the mission consists of tracking the
following five waypoints w1   0 0 3 T m,
w2   3 0 3 T m, w3   3 3 3 T m,
w4   6 3 3 T m, and w5   6 3 0 T m.
The time of convergence  is chosen in order
to respect the condition (22) for all the trajectory
segments.
Figure 3 shows the trajectory executed by
the vehicle as a continuous blue line. The waypoints are represented by stars, with the last one
in red. The reference trajectory is represented by
the dashed red lines.

Conclusions and Future Works

The present paper proposed a sliding mode controller (SMC) for waypoint-based guidance of a
multirotor aerial vehicle subject to a bounded
wind disturbance force.
The results presented in section 4 show that
the strategy was able to guide the quadrotor along
the waypoints. Even in the presence of random
external disturbance, the obtained trajectory has
good quality, with no overshoots and fast time response.
It was also verified that the proposed controller took and maintained the states in a band
close to sik  0, i  1, 2, 3, for each one of the

waypoints. This fact indicates the robustness of
the SMC against the external disturbance fk .
Otherwise, it is important to note that the
proposed controller doesnt consider any constraint (on position or thrust force) in the guidance algorithm, which is an important requirement of a MAV position control.
For further investigation of the proposed guidance method, an interesting future work would
be its experimental test in a laboratory with controlled wind. Other interesting future work would
be the study of a robust controller that also respect constraints on the thrust vector. For example, a mixed controller which combines the model
predictive control (MPC) strategy with SMC.
