Abstract Scleral lens is a large contact lens that cover part of scleral region of human eye. They are constructed from
two surfaces (anterior and posterior). In the design and production process of these lenses, optical imperfections
(aberrations) can be inserted, among other factors, due to the fact of peripheral light rays incident on the lens are refracted
more than the paraxial rays. In this case, instead of a well defined focal point, the lens presents a spread point (blur) in the
focal plane, and it produces a spherical aberration on the image. Spherical aberrations are optical effects that impair the
optical quality of the lens and therefore decrease the image quality. This paper presents a hybrid algorithm to optimize the
optical quality of scleral lens using a lower processing time than the one obtained using only genetic algorithm. The hybrid
algorithm combines the genetic algorithm and the Quasi-Newton Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb and Shanno (BFGS) method.
This optimization generates an optimal conic constant, which is added to the lens anterior curvature calculated to ensure
higher optical quality to the product by correcting its spherical aberration.

Resumo Lentes esclerais são lentes de contato maiores que cobrem parte de região da esclera do olho humano. Elas são
construídas a partir de duas superfícies (anterior e posterior). No projeto e processo produtivo destas lentes, imperfeições
(aberrações) ópticas podem ser inseridas devido, dentre outros fatores, ao fato dos raios de luz incidentes na periferia das
lentes serem mais refratados do que os raios que incidem próximo ao eixo óptico. Nesse caso, ao invés de um ponto focal
bem definido, a lente apresenta um ponto focal espalhado (borrado) no plano focal, produzindo uma aberração esférica na
imagem formada. Aberrações esféricas são efeitos ópticos que prejudicam a qualidade óptica das lentes e, portanto,
diminuem a qualidade da imagem. Este trabalho apresenta um algoritmo híbrido para otimizar a qualidade óptica de lentes
de contato esclerais usando um tempo de processamento menor que o obtido usando somente o algoritmo_genético. O
algoritmo híbrido proposto é construído pela associação de um algoritmo_genético ao método Quase-Newton de Broyden,
Fletcher, Goldfarb e Shanno (BFGS). Esta otimização gera uma constante_cônica ótima que, quando acrescentada 
curvatura anterior esférica calculada para a lente, garante maior qualidade óptica para o produto através da correção das
suas aberrações esféricas.

Introduction

Indications to scleral lens have evolved in the
last years, starting from a lens to hardly irregular
corneas to a very large gamma of indications. The
correction of irregular cornea to restore the vision is
the main indication to scleral lens because it covers
the entire corneal surface with a regular curvature
(Figure 2). However, there are suggestions from
experts (Worp, 2010 Worp, 2012 Roach, 2012)
about scleral lens use in a wide range of corneal
irregularities, instead of using a conventional
corneal lens. This indication is based on the fact that
the cornea is one of the most sensitive parts of
human body, since it has exposed sensory nerves
and any mechanical stress, which can be induced by
corneal lens direct contact, causes discomfort to the
user. Unlike the cornea, the sclera has a very low
sensitivity, favoring scleral lens use. When well
fitted, it exempts any contact to the sensitive cornea
(Worp, 2010 Worp, 2012).
Patients, in general, when submitted
to an
adaptation test with scleral lens, show positive
reception in relation to its comfort, which favors the
increasing popularity of this kind of lens on the
market (Worp, 2012).

Scleral lenses are large-diameter rigid gas
permeable lenses. They can range from 13.6 mm to
over 20 mm in diameter (Figure 1). They are called
scleral lenses because they completely cover the
cornea and extend onto the sclera, the white part of
the eye. Technological advances in the discovery of
materials with high oxygen transmissibility and
sophisticated designs made possible the widespread
use of large-diameter lenses nowadays (Roach,
2012).

thickness) and the refractive index of the material.
The anterior surface of the optical zone may be
produced in spherical or aspherical form. The
aspheric surfaces may reduce some intrinsic optical
aberration and they can be found in more
sophisticated designs of lens (Coral-Ghanen et al.,
1999). The posterior surface (concave face) should
be similar to the corneal curvature (Worp, 2010
Rosenthal, 2009).
2.1.2
Figure 2 Scleral lens basic design (Rosenthal, 2009).

The transitional zone (Figure 4) corresponds to
the intermediary zone between the optical zone and
the haptic zone. This region must be changeable to
fit to different corneal curvatures that the patient
may present.

Some lens is likely to fails and aberrations. One
of the most undesirable aberrations is spherical
aberration.
Spherical aberration is the focus blur caused by
a higher deviation of the peripheral rays in
comparison to the paraxial rays. This deviation
produces a blur instead of a point in the image plane
(Figure 3). Spherical aberration is more intense on
high power lens and can be reduced using aspheric
surfaces (Coral-Ghanen et al., 1999), which means
to add conics to the spherical radius. Then, the lens
gets into a conic form and improves its optical
quality.
Therefore, this work aims to develop a choice
method to the best conic constant that will be added
to lens spherical surface in the production process.

2.1.3

Haptic Zone

The haptic zone (Figure 4) is the lens region that
touches the sclera and provides the adequate support
to the system. Typically, the haptic zone is flat or it
is composed of a series of curves with radius from
13.5 mm to 15.4 mm, which normally fit to the
majority of the eyes (Worp, 2010).

Theoretical concepts
2.2 Scleral lens prescription

Concepts about lens design, prescription, optical
analysis and optimization are presented below to
provide a wider view of the proposed project.

To recommend contact lens to a patient, the
ophthalmologists usually makes tests to define the
lens specifications that best fits to the cornea.
Corneal biometric parameters and the lens power to
correct refractive errors are measured (CoralGhanen et al. 1999 Gemoules, 2008). These
informations are then sent to the lens maker, who
will calculate the three different zone parameters to
produce the lens. The optical zone, which is object
of this optimization work, is made up of two curves
anterior and posterior (Figure 4). The posterior curve
represents the concave part and faces the eye,
therefore it is defined by the corneal dimensions of
the patient. The anterior radius of curvature, ra
(mm), is defined by the desired lens power, diopter
(d), the central thickness, esp (mm), the refractive

2.1 Design aspects
In general, a simple scleral lens design may be
divided in optical zone, transitional zone and haptic
zone (Figure 4).
2.1.1

Optical Zone

The optical zone corresponds to the lens central
area and acts like an optical device. This region is
related to the lens desired power and can vary
according to the radius values of both conjugated
curvatures, the distance between them (central

Defining the anterior radius of curvature, by the
equation 1, there is a spherical radius value. This
value is used to produce the lens with a blurred in
the image focus, called spherical aberration.

2.3 Lens optical analysis
The quality of the projected image on the focal
plane is obtained by determining the modulation
transfer function (MTF). MTF is the magnitude of
optical system response when sinusoids of different
spatial frequencies are put on its input (Boreman,
2001). In other words, MTF is one common figure
of merit to measure lens quality. The MTF reference
value related to the International Standard ISO
11979-21999(E) (ISO, 1999) shall be greater or
equal to 0.43 for an acceptable imaging quality of
the optical system of model eye.
Since the purpose of the work is focused on the
optimization of the lens and not the modeling of a
wavefront that propagates and interacts with each
surface composing the eye to reach the retina, we
used a Raytrace software for optical design that is
capable of performing all tests required to
characterize optical lens. With it, you can model the
human eye and the variables of optical quality, as
the MTF, are calculated from the propagation of
light rays.

Termination it is checked if the solution

If not, the process is repeated.
Quasi-Newton Algorithm - BFGS method

The quasi-Newton algorithms are algorithms for
nonlinear_systems that in their method it need only
the gradient of the objective function available in
each iteration. By measuring changes in the gradient
between the iterations, it tries to build a model to the
objective function good enough to converge the
result (Lewis and Overton, 2013). Among QuasiNewton methods, Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb and
Shanno algorithm (BFGS) is considered the most
efficient and because of it the most popular (Skajaa,
2010).
Experiments have shown that the method has
strong properties of auto-correction, thus, if in some
interaction the matrix contains bad information of
curvature, it conducts to only a few actualizations to
correct these inaccuracies. Because of this reason,
BFGS method often has excellent working, and once
close to a minimum, normally reaches the
superlinear convergence rate (Skajaa, 2010).

2.4 Optimization Algorithms
Optimizing is the process of making something
better. An engineer or scientist evokes a new idea
and the optimization obtains the best point in this
idea. Optimization consists in trying variations
about an initial concept and uses the obtained results
to improve the idea. Optimization is then the specific
mathematic tool to obtain the best solution (Haupt
and Haupt, 2004).

3.1 Hybrid code purpose
The purpose of the hybrid algorithm model was to
utilize the genetic algorithm capability of spatial
search with the speed and precision of local search
of the deterministic BFGS method. In this proposal,
the genetic algorithm, which was limited to a few
number of iterations, was used in the beginning of
the program execution, to reduce the searching space
and find the direction of the top of the correct
answer. Starting in this point, the BFGS algorithm
will search the optimal result, with high
performance, precision and low cost.

Genetic Algorithm

Genetic algorithms use concepts originating from
the principle of natural selection of species to
approach a wide range of optimization problems.
Basically, the genetic algorithm creates a population
of possible answers to the problem being treated and
submit it to the evolution process, constituted by the
following stages (Costa, 1999)

Start of the genetic algorithm through

optimization toolbox of Matlab with a
limit of 12 conic constants random
values (initial population) in the
defined range of -5 to 0 and number
of iterations limited to five. The
objective function inside of the
Raytrace software evaluates the conic
constant inserted in the optical system.
The return of this function is the MTF
fitness (lens optical quality).
At the end of five iterations, a conic
constant close to the ideal is given,
then the BFGS method is called to find
in a precise and fast way the conic
optimal value.
The algorithm returns the conic ideal
value to a specific lens, the MTF
theoretical value and the execution

Results

5.1 Analysis with optimization
Firstly, it was performed the analysis of a lens
optimized with the hybrid process purposed in the
work. The rays focus at a single point, as shown in
Figure 5.

Simulation
(a)

The Raytrace software allows communication
with Matlab, therefore, it is possible to use the
optimization tools in Matlabs toolbox, and call
the software only when analyzing the objective
function, understood as a black box. Therefore,
data like the anterior curvature, posterior curvature,
and conic value of the lens are given to Raytrace
software, which, in return, gives the MTF value.
The motivation to use optimization algorithms to
define the best conic constant, instead of only an
equation group, is the fact that it is very complex to
model analytically a light beam spreading through
eye structures.
The algorithm tests were performed to
analysis of the following situations
- Analysis of lens optical quality with and
without optimization
 Lens optical quality of a four diopter test
lens with the constant optimized through
the genetic and BFGS hybrid algorithm
 Lens optical quality of a four diopter test
lens considered as totally spherical
(without the optimization process)

The result was a conic constant value optimized
to -0.2749 (best result returned by the hybrid
algorithm), in which the program returned an MTF
value equal to 91.1621. This value is considered a
good result because it is very close to the theoretical
maximum and it allowed sharp view of the test
object, represented by a window, with high
distinctness (Figure 6).

prosecution pure BFGS, pure genetic and finally the
genetic and BFGS hybrid algorithm.

5.2 Analysis without optimization
Posteriorly a lens without optimization was
evaluated, namely, a lens with conic constant equal
to zero (spherical). The results are shown in Figure
7, in which the rays do not focus at a single point,
therefore the MTF also decreases, making clear the
effects of spherical aberration.

5.3.1

Pure BFGS algorithm

To analyze the purposed problem with the pure
BFGS algorithm, it was performed tests with five
conic different initial values within the searching
limit from -5 to 0 and epsilon step size tolerance of

According to Table 1, BFGS algorithm has low
processing time, but it has also premature
convergence in local maximum. Therefore, to have
a good BFGS performance, it is necessary to have a
start point close to global maximum.
5.3.2

Pure genetic algorithm

(b)

The following test is performed using pure
genetic algorithm. The inputs and outputs are
described in Table 2.
According to the results, the genetic algorithm
has good convergence, as shown in Figure 9. The
Fitness value, in MTF, is the response of the optical
system model for the various conic values in the
entrance of the objective function.
The pure genetic algorithm converging graph
shows that in the 30 iterations available, the
algorithm reaches the best fitness after the 23rd
iteration and generates satisfactory results, but it
needs high processing time (Table 2), 18 times
higher than the average of pure BFGS method.

representing the low optical quality of the tested lens.

With the conic constant equal to zero, the
algorithm returned an average of MTF values equal
to 18.9000, considered a low value (the top line
means the maximum value). Despite the blur, that
MTF value does not preclude the observer to
interpret the object using a spherical lens, (Figure 8).
5.3 Algorithm comparison
As a second part of this work, it was performed
the comparison of the following algorithms

Conclusion

The genetic algorithm, through its global search
of solutions space, reached convergence in the best
global individual, but it had high processing cost.
The BFGS algorithm, in contrast with the first one,
was a fast algorithm however this algorithm has a
premature convergence in the local maximum, and
then it needs an initial searching value close to the
best result. The hybrid algorithm, proposed in the
work, extracted the best of each method to reach the
ideal value. Using the global search of genetic
algorithm with few iterations (to keep the low
processing cost) the way to the solution was found.
Then, using the BFGS algorithm, the best conic
value was located.
Therefore, the hybrid algorithm proposed in the
work allows to reach the best conic constant in an
average three times lower than the pure genetic
algorithm. This advantage impacts the production
process in the time required to design the lens and
provides the best optical quality.
Nowadays, the use of optimized aspheric scleral
lenses is not common on the market and the use of
spherical lenses is wider. The simulation results of
this work showed that is possible to make high
optical quality scleral lenses to improve the human
vision.
