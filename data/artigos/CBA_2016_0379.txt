Abstract This paper addresses the problem of path tracking control for a tilt-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV), in the presence of external disturbances and noisy measurements. A deterministic, guaranteed state
estimator based on zonotopes is proposed in this work for dealing with the available measurements. The state
estimator is shown to be capable of providing full information about the states of the UAV, even when the sensors
have different sampling times. Then, a discrete-time linear quadratic regulator is designed for path tracking
control with constant disturbances rejection, with feedback from the estimated states. Simulation results are
presented in order to validate the proposed strategy.

Introduction

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have received
great attention from researchers in the last two
decades. Recently, researches focusing on the design and control of convertible UAVs have grown
considerably, in which the tilt-rotor configuration
is considered. Tilt-rotor UAVs are hybrid aircrafts, capable of performing high-speed flights,
as fixed-wing ones, and vertical take-off and landing, as rotorcrafts. Some works concerning tiltrotor UAVs are Di Francesco and Mattei (2015),
which proposes a controller based on incremental
nonlinear dynamic inversion for a tilt-rotor UAV
and Almeida and Raffo (2015), which addresses
the problem of load transportation.
The problem of state estimation often arises in
state-feedback control, when incomplete state information is available for feedback connection, or,
e.g., when available information is corrupted with
noise. In the literature, state estimators based on
stochastic approaches, like the Kalman filter, are
often employed for solving this problem, by providing all the system states to the controller with
minimum estimation error variance. However, in
order to design these states estimators, assumptions about the probability distributions of the
measurement disturbances must be made.
Guaranteed state estimation approaches,
which are deterministic, are based on the construction of sets that include, with guarantee, the
system states consistent with available measure-

ments. These approaches are suitable for cases in
which bounds for the measurement uncertainties
are known. In the last decades, several authors
have proposed guaranteed estimation techniques
for discrete-time systems Chisci et al. (1996),
which presents a recursive algorithm based on parallelotopes for linear systems and Alamo et al.
(2005) and Le et al. (2013), which propose techniques based on zonotopes for nonlinear_systems
and for uncertain linear systems, respectively.
The present work deals with path tracking
control of a tilt-rotor UAV, subject to a scenario with external disturbances and noisy measurements. Moreover, available sensors are assumed to have different sampling times. A guaranteed state estimator, based on the zonotopic
technique proposed by Alamo et al. (2005), is designed in order to provide information about the
entire state vector from the available measurements. The technique is adapted for multi-output
systems whose measurement vector is not complete at every time instant. Thereafter, a discretetime linear quadratic regulator is designed for the
path tracking task, based on discrete-time linearized error dynamics with integral actions. The
control loop is then closed by choosing the centers
of the zonotopes as estimated states.

be found in Donadel et al. (2014).
Figure 1 illustrates the tilt-rotor UAV, which
is regarded as a mechanical system composed of
three rigid bodies i) main body, composed of
carbon-fiber structure, landing gear, batteries and
electronic devices ii) right rotor group, which includes the right servomotor and right propeller
and iii) left rotor group, which includes the left
servomotor and left propeller.
The inertial frame, the aircrafts geometric
center frame, and the frame attached to the ith rigid bodys center of mass, i  1, 2, 3, are
denoted by I, B and Ci , respectively. It is assumed that the rotor groups centers of mass are
located at their respective tilting axes. The aircraft position with respect to I is denoted by

by Euler angles  ,   T using the ZY X
convention about local axes (Jazar, 2010). Vectors dB

Guaranteed state estimator design

This section presents the design of a state estimator based on the zonotopic guaranteed state estimation (ZSGE) technique (Alamo et al., 2005),
which is capable of providing information about
all states of the tilt-rotor UAV. It is assumed that
available measurements are noisy and provided
by sensors with different sampling times (e.g. a
Global Positioning System (GPS) equipment and
an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)). Necessary
notation and definitions are introduced.

Let IR denote the set of compact real intervals

their ranges over xaq . An interval vector (called
as box) is denoted by xaq . An interval matrix is
denoted by xAq . For boxes and interval matrices,
mid and diam are defined component-wise.

Consider a nonlinear discrete-time system
with time update xk  f (xk1 , wk1 ) and measurement yk  g(xk , vk ), where xk  Rnx , yk 
R, wk  Rnw represents external disturbances,
process noise and parametric uncertainties, and
vk  R represents measurement noise. Assume
that wk  W, vk  V and x0  X0 , where W,
V and X0 are known compact sets. Then, the
uncertain trajectory of the system is defined by
f (Xk1 , W), the set of states consistent with yk
if defined as Xyk , x  Rnx  yk  g(x, V),
and the exact uncertain state set is defined by
Xk , f (Xk1 , W)  Xyk . The ZGSE uses zonotopes and strips in order to estimate an outer
bound of the exact uncertain state set at time instant k, denoted by Xk .
As shown by Kuhn (1998), orbits of discretetime systems can be computed by zonotopes with
reduced overestimation. Assuming that a zonotope Xk1  cxk1  Gxk1 Brxk1 is available,
and that W  cw  Gw Brw , an outer bound
of the uncertain trajectory f (Xk1 , W) is obtained by Xk  Zq  xMq Brx , where xMq ,
x f (Xk1 , W)Gxk1 and Zq  f (cxk1 , W).
This operation is called prediction.
A strip Xyk , x  Rnx  T x  yk 
s   containing the set of consistent states
is computed by interval arithmetic, such that
  midx g(Xk , V) and T Xk g(Xk , V) 
s  , s + . Then, a zonotope Xk ()  cxk () 
Gxk ()Brxk containing Xk  Xyk is computed as
cxk ()  cxk + (  T cxk ) and Gxk () 
(Inx nx  T )Gxk , where   Rnx is a
parameter chosen by design criteria. These two
operations together are called correction. A choice
that minimizes the Frobenius norm of Gxk () is
given by   (Gxk GTxk )(T Gxk GTxk  +  2 ).
The ZGSE is summarized in Algorithm 1.
Algorithm 1 ZGSE algorithm
1 Compute the zonotope Xk  f (Xk1 , W)
2 Compute the strip Xyk  Xyk
3 Compute the zonotope Xk ()  Xk  Xyk

The order of Xk increases at each time step.
Algorithm 2 can be used for establishing an upper
limit s to it.
Note that the ZGSE is formulated for singleoutput systems. In the case of multi-output systems, steps 2 and 3 from Algorithm 1 can be applied iteratively for each element of the measurement vector (Le et al., 2013).

State estimator for the tilt-rotor UAV

Although the ZGSE is formulated for nonlinear
systems, computational complexity arises when
performing the prediction operation, for the time
update equation obtained by discretizing (2).
Then, equations (3) are used instead, evaluated
at an equilibrium point, and discretized using the
zero-order-holder (ZOH) method, leading to1

where d denotes discrete-time, Ad  R1616 ,
Bd  R164 , Nd  R168 , and w represents modeling errors resulting from linearization.
This work assumes that the measurement vector is given by y , q T  T R L T , however
not all elements are available at every instant k.
As a function of xk , we have yk  Hd xk + vk ,
where Hd  R1316 and v is the measurement
noise. Rewriting it as a function of x yields
yk  Hd xk + vk , where vk , Hd xeq + vk .
Furthermore, assume that2 d  d 015 T ,

to estimate the external disturbances along with

Control design

This section presents the design of a discrete-time
linear quadratic regulator (DLQR) for solving the
path tracking problem for the tilt-rotor UAV, with
constant disturbances rejection. The controller is
designed based on discrete-time linearized error
dynamics with integral actions.

Discrete-time linearized error dynamics

The tilt-rotor UAV is an underactuated mechanical system with only four control inputs, which
means that four variables can be chosen to be
regulated. In this case x, y, z and . Define
 tr , xtr y tr z tr T ,  tr , eq eq  tr T
and q tr ,  tr  tr R eq L eq T . Assuming that  tr is constant, we have q tr 
( tr )T 015 T and q tr  ( tr )T 015 T .
Then, define xtr , (q tr )T (q tr )T T and utr ,
fRtr fLtr trR trL T . Evaluating (3) at these
variables yields to  x  Ac (t)x + Bc u + Nc d,
where Ac (t) is time-varying due to utr (Donadel
et al., 2014). For control design purposes, this
work assumes that Ac (t)  Ac (t)utr ueq , Ac ,
which is constant. The subsequent error is considered as unmodeled dynamics, and the controller
to be designed is assumed to be robust enough to
deal with it. Therefore,  x  Ac x+Bc u+Nc d.
For constant disturbances rejection
R T purposes,

performed, whose continuous-time dynamics are
obtained by properly augmenting Ac , Bc and Nc .
Finally, applying the ZOH discretization method
over the continuous-time dynamics of  yields to

The controllability matrix for pair (A , B ) is full

This work assumes that the available measurements are provided by a GPS, a Barometer,
an IMU and sensors embedded at the servomotors. The associated parameters are shown in Table 1, in which noise from the servos sensors have
zero-mean uniform distribution, and noise from
the other sensors have zero-mean Gaussian distribution. For the latter, noise bound means three
times the standard deviation. The set Ik is given
by the union of sets I of sensors whose measurements are available at time instant k.

specified units are given in rads.
Figure 8. Note the toothed pattern of the limits, which is a consequence of the GPS sampling
time. Figure 9 shows the estimation error and
confidence limits for the remaining states.

Conclusions

This paper presented path tracking control strategy based on guaranteed state estimation for a
tilt-rotor UAV. The aircrafts equations of motion
were presented. Assuming that available information is provided by noisy measurements with different sampling times, a guaranteed state estimator based on zonotopes was designed, providing information about the entire state vector at the controller sampling time. Based on the discrete-time
linearized error dynamics with integral actions, a
DLQR was designed for path tracking with constant disturbances rejection capability. Simulation results corroborated the validity of the control
strategy, and also showed the good performance of
the guaranteed state estimator.
