Abstract The model-free strategy called Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) is applied to the
pitch attitude_control of a Twin-Rotor system. The original ADRC strategy is modified to account for the
quantization of systems pitch angle associated with the use of an incremental encoder. The modifications
include the use of Algebraic Differentiator to smooth out the measured pitch angle, together with a Robust
and Exact Differentiator (RED) to estimate the main rotor propeller angular speed. Experimental results are
provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the modified ADRC strategy.

Introduction

The design of controllers for nonlinear dynamical systems usually relies on specific strategies for
specific classes of systems, with these classes defined by properties associated with the underlying
mathematical models of the systems under consideration (Slotine and Li, 1990 Khalil, 2001).
Contrary to this well-established approach
of investigating the control problem in rigorous mathematical grounds based on well-defined
mathematical models, recently there has been
some very interesting papers defending the opposite idea of using model-free strategies to control nonlinear_systems. Particularly, one can highlight the influential work by the professor1 Han
(2009), where a new universal control strategy,
called the Active Disturbance Rejection Control
(ADRC) method, is purposely designed as a replacement for the popular PID controller. In the
same vein, Fliess and Join (2013) have presented
the idea of using time-derivatives estimation as a
step to control nonlinear_systems without knowing
the underlying mathematical model.
The common point between these two modelfree strategies can be seen as the attempt to cancel the original dynamics of the system by means
of an appropriate estimation of high-order time1 Deceased in April, 2008. See the message from the
Editor-in-Chief in (Han, 2009).

derivatives of the systems output. This means
that the presence of abrupt changes in the output signal, as it would be expected if the systems
output is quantized, could be deleterious to the
performance of the closed-loop system.
Following the idea of incrementally modifying the original ADRC strategy to handle specific problems, e.g. as presented in (Zheng and
Gao, 2016), in this work a modified ADRC strategy is proposed with two main objectives, namely
(i) to present to a larger Brazilian control community the ADRC strategy (Han, 2009), together
with some very interesting concepts related to the
work in (Fliess and Join, 2013) and (ii) to achieve
improved results using the ADRC method, even
when there is quantization in the output signal.
The improvement depends crucially on the ideas
in (Fliess and Join, 2013) to smooth the quantized output signal. To show the effectiveness of
the proposed strategy, experimental results on the
pitch attitude_control for a Twin Rotor System
(TRS) (Feedback, 2006) is provided.

Model-Free Control Techniques

To illustrate the main general ideas in the modelfree control techniques presented in (Han, 2009)
and (Fliess and Join, 2013), consider a SingleInput Single-Output (SISO) input affine nonlinear dynamical system with well-defined relative

degree r. It is worth noticing that this class encompasses a large set of dynamical systems. In
this case, one can represent the system using a
special set of coordinates such that part of the
state vector is comprised by the output and its
corresponding time-derivatives (Isidori, 1989), i.e.
y (r) F (y, y, . . . , y (r1) , z)

(2)

with F (t)  F (y, y, . . . , y (r1) , z) and G(t) 
G(y, y, . . . , y (r1) , z) bounded functions. In both
strategies (Han, 2009 Fliess and Join, 2013) the
authors propose the use of a feedback linearizing
like control law

with F (t)  R  R an estimative of the function
F (t) Gc  R a nonzero constant used as an approximation for G(t) and v a virtual control input
whose final form will make (2) resemble, in both
cases, a stable differential equation on the error
variable e(t)  yref (t)  y(t), where yref (t) is the
reference signal to be tracked (Han, 2009 Fliess
and Join, 2013).
One key difference between these strategies is
the way the approximation F (t) is obtained. However, in both cases the process of computing F (t),
and therefore the energy of the control input in
(3), depends on the smoothness of the systems
output signal, as it will be illustrated in the next
sections.
2.1

A key subsystem in the ADRC structure (Han,
2009), shown in Figure 1, is the so-called Extended
State Observer (ESO), which is used to provide an
estimative of F (t) in (2). Consider the augmented
system

xr+1  D(t), y  x1 ,

which is equivalent to (2) as long as xr+1  F (t),
such that D(t)  dFdt(t) . From this description, a
Luemberger-like observer can be designed as
x 1  x2 + 1 (y  x1 ),
x 2  x3 + 2 (y  x1 ),    ,
x r  xr+1 + Gc u + r (y  x1 ),

(4)

x r+1  r+1 (y  x1 ),

where i () i  1, 2, . . . , r + 1 are scalar, not necessarily linear, functions of the observation error
y  x1 . Clearly, the structure in (4) can be seen
as a Unknown Input Observer (UIO) (Takahashi
and Peres, 1999) with D(t) and (G(t)  Gc )u(t)
as unknown inputs, such that the observer state
xr+1 is used as an estimative for F (t) in (2) i.e.
F (t)  xr+1 in (3).
Other two subsystems necessary to implement
the ADRC strategy are the Transient Profile Generator (TPG), and the Nonlinear Weighted Sum
(NWS) (see Fig. 2 in Han (2009)).
The TPG is a second-order dynamical system
described by

with yref
(t)  1 , and p a smoothing parameter.
System (5) acts similarly to a low-pass filter by
receiving the reference signal yref (t) as its input
and producing a continuously differentiable outs
put yref
(t), that otherwise follows closely the original reference signal. In addition, note that the acs
companying signal yref
(t)  2 is also made available for control purposes.
Finally, in the NWS subsystem the virtual
control v in (3) is computed as a possibly nons
linear combination of e1  yref

Differentiation Strategies

In Fliess and Join (2013) an alternative approach
to the ESO is employed to compute F (t) in (3) by
directly differentiating the systems output y(t)
i.e. from (2) one has that F (t)  y (r)  Gc u(t),
assuming that u(t) is known. To differentiate y(t),

the main idea is to consider that, for the last T
seconds, the systems output can be approximated
by a polynomial time function with a prescribed
degree of nonlinearity m, such that
y( )  a0 + a1  + . . . + am  m ,   t  T, t,

Twin-Rotor Description

The Twin-Rotor System, shown in Figure 2, is a
two-degrees of freedom electromechanical system
used in didactic control experiments (Feedback,
2006).
By locking up the yaw movement around the
vertical axis, the rod that unites the two propellers
is allowed to swing up and down as it changes
the pitch angle orientation around the horizontal
axis, and the TRS becomes a one-degree of freedom mechanism.

where the coefficients ai , i  0, 1, 2, . . . , m, are
computed based on the measured values of y(t)
in the last time window. Their computation is
derived following the rules of the so-called Operational Calculus in the Laplace variable s, as detailed in Zehetner et al. (2007) and Mboup et al.
(2009). Interestingly, the coefficients computation
depends only on time integrals, which makes them
somewhat robust to noise, but introduces unavoidable time-delay in their estimation. Clearly, from
the knowledge of the coefficients ai , it is easy to
estimate the time-derivatives of y(t). This procedure will be called hereafter Algebraic Differentiation Procedure (ADP). Note that the ADP
depends on the choice of the two parameters T
and m, but it is implemented as a linear finite impulse response (FIR) digital filter, and therefore
it is stable.
An alternative approach to compute timederivatives is to consider the associated tracking
control problem where a controller is designed to
achieve limt x(t)  y(t)  0, with x(t) the
state of the first-order pure integrator given by
x  u, and x, u  R. In this case, assuming
the fulfillment of the zero error objective, the controller output signal u(t) can be used as a estimative for the time derivative of the signal y(t).
Following this approach, in the so-called Robust
and Exact Differentiator (RED) (Levant, 1998),
a second-order sliding mode controller (Shtessel
et al., 2014, Chapter 4) is employed to guarantee finite-time convergence of the error, such that
a time derivative estimation with good accuracy
becomes available in short time. Despite this, the
presence of high frequency additive noise can degrade considerably the performance of the RED.
In this work both differentiation strategies
ADP and RED will be employed, respectively, to
counteract the output signal quantization, and to
provide an estimative of one of the systems state
variables not directly measured (Section 4).

The main propulsive torque used to control
the pitch angle is associated with the rotational

input voltage applied to a DC motor that drives
the propeller. The pitch angle is measured by
means of an incremental encoder with limited resolution, leading to quantization of systems output.
By applying Newtons second law to the rotational movement around the horizontal axis, and
by representing the DC motor dynamics as a first

A Modified ADRC

Quantization of the systems output signal introduces high frequency content associated with
abrupt changes in the measured values. In the
case of the Twin-Rotor, this is a consequence of
using an incremental encoder to measure the pitch
angle. In this work a smoothing technique based
on the use of an Algebraic Differentiation Procedure (ADP) (see Section 2.2) is employed to provide a differentiable approximation of the systems
output to the ESO input (see Figure 1). This
modification results in lower energy for the control signal variation, as it will be shown in Section
5.
In addition, an Inverse Dynamics (ID) subsystem is used to drive indirectly the Twin-Rotor
propulsive torque. This is accomplished by computing the necessary input voltage to be applied
to the TRS main rotor in order to achieve a target
rotational speed associated with a desired propulsive torque as computed by the ADRC strategy.
More specifically, from (11), by assuming that
Tp (x3 )  Tpd (t), at each time instant, the positive
value xd3 (t) that satisfies the polynomial equation
Tpd (t)  1 (xd3 (t))2 + 2 xd3 (t) is determined. The
input voltage is then computed, from (10), as

Experimental Results

The modified ADRC performance is tested
through five experimental results obtained in a
real Twin-Rotor system. The experiments have
been set to take 60s with sampling time 10ms,
m  1 and T  0.2s for ADP in (7).
Initially, a first comparison analysis is performed between two control strategies based on
pure ADRCs (see Section 2.1), in which one strategy, namely ADRC(3), makes use of an ESO
for estimating three states while the other one,

where (t) is the output of a RED (Section 2.2)
whose input is xd3 (t). Therefore, ideally the series
connection of the blocks ID and TRS in Figure 1
would compose an equivalent second-order mechanical system whose input is torque, and whose
output is pitch angle. It is worth noting that, although the approximated dynamical cancellation
in (12) is not robust to parametric uncertainties
in the DC motor parameters, by relying on the
ADRC strategy, one expects to still have good results, as it was indeed the case as presented in
Section 5.

namely ADRC(4), estimates four states. In a first
set of experiments these controllers are required
to track a step reference signal, as shown in Figure 3, and in a second experiment these controllers
are evaluated while tracking a sinusoidal reference
signal, illustrated in Figure 4. The ADRC(3) was
synthesized with the control gains Kp  4.5 and

Figure 3 Step response with ADRC techniques.
From Figure 3, one can observe that both pure
ADRCs converge to the desired step reference, although both strategies presented time-delay due
to the observer dynamics. Moreover, since the
ADRC(4) was tuned to be more aggressive, its
time response presented faster raising time, but
at the cost of higher control effort and more oscillatory transient than ADRC(3).
In order to evaluate the pure ADRCs with
time-varying reference signals and the same controllers and observer gains used previously, experiments with sinusoidal reference were obtained. From Figure 4, it is observed that neither ADRC(3) nor ADRC(4) were able to track
the reference, destabilizing the TRS.

On the other hand, to analyze the modifications proposed in this work, two set of experiments
have been performed for comparing the modified
ADRC ID (ADRC(3) with the ID block that uses
the RED approach) against the modified ADRC
ID ADP (ADRC(3) with the ID block that uses
the RED approach, and with the ADP block).
Again, results with step and sinusoidal reference
signals were obtained for the third and fourth experiments, respectively.
Figure 5 illustrates the good results obtained
when the modified ADRCs are required to track a
step reference. Both control strategies achieved
fast convergence to the reference with a nonoscillatory time response. Besides, the time-delay
introduced by the observer dynamics was reduced.
The ADRC ID and ADRC ID ADP were tuned
with the same parameters Kp  3.5, Kd  1.5,
and functions 1 (y x1 )  L1 (y x1 ), 2 (y x1 ) 
L2 f (yx1 , 0.5, ), 3 (yx1 )  L3 f (yx1 , 0.25, ),
in (4) with L1  28.8881, L2  278.0063 and
L3  891.8834, and   1. When comparing these
modified controllers, one can observe that the
ADRC ID was more aggressive presenting higher
control effort, as can be seen in detail from Figure
5.
In order to highlight the improvement obtained by the proposed modified ADRC in comparison with the pure ADRC strategy, both
ADRC ID and ADRC ID ADP were required to
track a sinusoidal reference signal, presenting a
good performance, and keeping the TRS stable
throughout the desired trajectory, as illustrated
in Figure 6. Furthermore, due to the smoothness
properties of the Algebraic Differentiation Proce-

Furthermore, to perform a quantitative analysis of the results obtained with the ADRC ID
and ADRC ID ADP when they were submitted to the sinusoidal reference signal, three performance indexes were computed the Integral

to achieve better results when the systems output
is quantized.

Finally, the fifth experiment is realized, to verify the capability of the modified ADRC to deal with
disturbances, a step disturbance with amplitude value
of 0.5V was applied to the system at t  35s when
the TRS was tracking the step reference signal. The
results are shown in Figure 7.

controlled system, allowing to reduce the control effort. This is accomplished by the smoothing of the
output signal thanks to the use of the ADP, and by
relying on the alleged robustness associated with the
ESO in the ADRC strategy.
Experimental results were obtained in order to illustrate the improvement achieved with the proposed
strategy. Tests with step and sinusoidal reference signals, and also with step disturbances and uncertain
parameters, were carried out. From qualitative and
quantitative results it was corroborated the good performance of the ADRC ID ADP with lower control
signal power consumption, and small tracking error
for sinusoidal references.
