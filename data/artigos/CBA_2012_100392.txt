Abstract
 Conventional sensored vector control of permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) using a resolver sensor as
position transducer requires four analog-to-digital converters (ADC) two for the stator currents and other two for the resolver
sensor. This paper proposes the use of frequency domain multiplexing (FDM) to reduce the number of ADCs for sensored control of PMSM. Using simple Fouier analysis, it is proved that the signals of the position sensor and the current sensors work in
different frequency bands of the magnitude spectrum. As a result, those signals can be multiplexed in frequency. The signal of
one of the current sensor is combined to one of the outputs of the resolver sensor, generating a new signal which is send to an
ADC of the digital controller. The signals are easily reconstructed through a set of digital filters. In consequence, only two analog-to-digital converters are needed to get the four signals about stator currents and angular position. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the potentiality of the application of frequency domain multiplexing in the position and speed vector control of PMSM, and FDM can be applied in other three-phase motors.

Resumo
 Controle vetorial convencional do motor síncrono de ímã permanente (PMSM) com um sensor resolver como transdutor da posição_angular requer de quatro conversores analógico-digital (ADC) dois para monitorar as correntes do estator, e os
outros dois para o sensor_de_posição. O presente artigo propõe o uso de multiplexação no domínio_da_freqência (FDM) para reduzir o número de ADCs para o controle do PMSM com sensor_de_posição. O artigo demonstra, através da análise de Fourier,
que os sinais dos sensores_de_corrente e posição possuem diferentes larguras de banda no espectro de magnitude. Em conseqência, aqueles sinais podem ser multiplexados em freqência. O sinal de um dos sensores_de_corrente é combinado com uma saída
do sensor resolver, gerando um novo sinal que é enviado a um ADC do controlador_digital. Os sinais originais são reconstruídos
através de um conjunto de filtros_digitais. Como resultado, somente são necessários dois ADCs para obter os quatro sinais necessários sobre as correntes e a posição_angular do motor. Resultados de simulação e experimentais demonstram a potencialidade da aplicação da multiplexação no domínio_da_freqência no controle_vetorial da velocidade e posição do PMSM, e que a técnica FDM pode ser utilizada em outros motores trifásicos.

Introduction

Electrical motors with controllable position and
speed are required tools in industrial processes.
Nowadays, permanent magnet synchronous motor
(PMSM) is suitable for the implementation of variable frequency drive applications and servomechanisms by its better relation torquesize and robustness than DC motors, and by its lower torque ripple
and better electrical efficiency than induction motors
(Udin et al., 2000 Terzic and Jadric, 2001).
Vector control allows controlling the torque,
speed and angular position of a three-phase motor.
This technique is based in the representation of the
three-phase voltages, currents and fluxes in a dq0
orthogonal reference system through Park transform
(Bose, 1997). Two stator currents are measured to
generate the stator voltages to get the desired angular

position or speed (Bose, 1997 Rashid, 2001).
Closed-loop vector control of PMSM also requires
the angular position of the motor shaft, which can be
measured through sensors or be estimated through
sensorless techniques (Bose, 1997 Staebler, 2000).
Encoders are position transducer commonly used
by its low cost, easy installation and operation. However, resolver sensors are suitable for applications
that demand higher resolution and robustness, due to
it works with analogical signals with theoretical infinite resolution (Bose, 1997, Lee et al., 1992). This
sensor is coupled to the motor shaft and generates
two signals which are non-linear functions of the angular position. Many techniques were made to get the
angular position from resolver sensors feedback
tracking systems (Hanselman, 1990 Yim et al., 1992
Benammar et al., 2005 Kaewjinda and Konghirun,
2006) and demodulation techniques (Staebler, 2000
García et al., 2011).

As a result, sensored vector control of PMSM
requires four analog-to-digital converters (ADC) two
for the current sensors and two for the resolver sensor. This paper proposes the use of frequency domain
multiplexing (FDM) to reduce the required number of
ADCs in vector control of PMSM. Communication
systems apply FDM to send data with different
bandwidths by the same channel (Yuminaka et al.,
1991 Dai et al., 2009 Noune et al., 2009). It is proved that the signals from current sensors and resolver
sensor have different bandwidths, making simpler the
implementation of FDM than other multiplexing
techniques as time domain multiplexing (TDM),
which is more difficult to use due to it needs a synchronization system (Roden, 1979).
The signal of one of the current sensors is added
to one of output of the resolver sensor, creating a new
signal which is acquired by the ADC. The original
signals are reconstructed using a set of digital filters.
With the FDM technique, only two ADCs are needed
to get the four signals from the current and position
sensors. This reduction is important to implement
vector control in FPGAs, where generally an external
circuit is required to makes the analog-to-digital conversion. Simulation and experimental results show
the potentiality of the use of FDM in vector control.
2 Analysis of the Bandwidth of the Position and
Stator Current Signals

Figure 1. Resolver sensor.

If the excitation frequency is much greater than
the angular speed, therefore me  0 and equations
(2) and (3) can be approximated as follows

v sin (t )  rae sin( ) cos(e t )

(4)

vcos (t )  rae cos( ) cos(e t )

(5)

Equations (4) and (5) indicate that the outputs
of the resolver sensor have a non-linear dependence
of the angular position of the shaft. Conventionally, a
resolver-to-digital converter (RDC) is used to get the
angular position from this sensor (Bose, 1997). However, its high cost motivates the design of substitutes
for RDC implemented in hardware or software. As
the information about the angular position is used for
control of electrical machines, it is preferred software-based solutions, due to digital processors as
DSPs or FPGAs have computational resources to
analyze the outputs of the resolver sensor and execute
the control algorithms of the motor.

2.1 Modeling of Resolver Sensor
Figure 1 shows the structure of resolver sensor. The
excitation winding is coupled to the motor shaft and
receives a sinusoidal excitation voltage ve(t) through
a revolving transformer. This signal induces two
voltages in the stator windings, which depends on the
angular position, according to equations (1), (2) and
(3) (Di Tomasso and Miceli, 2003)

2.2 Spectrum of the Signals of the Resolver Sensor
Defining xs(t)  sin(), xc(t)  cos(), and their Fourier transforms Xs()  Fxs(t) and Xc()  Fxc(t).
The Fourier transform of vsin(t) and vcos(t) are obtained from equations (4) and (5) as follows

F vs in (t )  rae F xs (t ) cos(et )

(6)

F vcos (t )  rae F xc (t ) cos(et )

Equations (8) and (9) indicate that the spectra of
vsin(t) and vcos(t) are shifted copies of the spectra of
sin() and cos(), as shown in Figure 2. For   mt,
being ae  10 V, e  4,39104 rads (7 kHz), r  0,8,
and m  104,72 rads, the Fourier transform of
cos(mt) is two impulse functions () centered in m
and -m, as indicated in equation (10) (Roden, 1979)

of cos(t), but centered at 7 kHz. In general, the bandwidth of vsin(t) and vcos(t) depend only of the angular
position of the motor shaft and the excitation frequency of the resolver sensor.

Permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) is a
three-phase synchronous motor with a set of permanent magnets in its rotor, instead of rotor windings,
which generates the rotor flux (Bose, 1997). The dynamic behavior of PMSM is described by the following equations (Pillay and Krishnan, 1988)

Being a b cT and d q 0T the variables in the
abc and dq0 systems respectively, and k  23. According to equations (14), (15) and (16), the q-axis
stator current can be adjusted to control the angular
position or speed. On the other hand, the d-axis stator
current controls the magnetic flux of PMSM. Generally, the d-axis stator current is set to zero (id*  0)
for reducing the energy consumption of the motor,
except when flux weakening techniques are used to
increase the speed of PMSM (Bose, 1997).
The d-axis and q-axis stator current references
(id* and iq*) are generating using other two closedloop controllers, whose outputs are the d-axis and qaxis stator voltage references (vd* and vq*). A inverse
Park transformation is applied to vd* vq* 0T, based
on equation (17), in order to get the stator voltage
references va* vb* vc*T in the abc system. These references are obtained through a modulation technique
that controls the switching states of the inverter.
Space vector modulation (SVM) is generally used to
its less harmonic distortion, greater linear range and
less switching losses than other techniques as sinusoidal modulation (Van der Broek et al., 1988 Holtz,
1994 Chai and Cheng, 2008).
Figure 4 shows the scheme of the position vector
control of PMSM, which is the same for speed controller (only change speed for angular position).

2.4 Bandwidth of the Stator Currents of PMSM
Figure 5 shows the power spectrum of the line-to-line
voltage and the stator current of a PMSM fed by a
three-phase inverter which operates with a switching
frequency of 15 kHz. The use of a modulation technique with fixed switching frequency as SVM concentrates the harmonics of voltages and currents near
to multiples of the switching frequency (Bose, 1997
Rashid, 2001 García e Pinto, 2009). Modulation
techniques with variable switching frequency as hysteresis modulation do not produce that effect.

3 Proposed Tecnique for the Reduction of the
Number of ADCs
3.1 Frequency Domain Multiplexing
Frequency domain multiplexing (FDM) is a technique widely used in telecommunication systems that
consists in the transmission of data from different
sources to the same channel.
If the signals have bandwidths in different locations of the spectrum without overlapping between
them, then those signals can be combined through an
addition process and send to the same channel. The
reception system can restore the signals using a set of
filters whose cut-off frequencies depends on the
bandwidths of the signals (Roden, 1979). Figure 6
illustrates the concept of FDM.

Figure 6. Concept of frequency domain multiplexing.

 Figure 4 shows that the power spectrum of the
stator current, in the frequency band of the outputs of the resolver sensor (near to 7 kHz as
shown in Figure 3), is less than -87 dB, which is
negligible for practical applications.
 The inverter operates with a fixed switching
frequency greater than the excitation frequency
of the resolver sensor. This requirement can be
satisfied due to the rated switching frequencies
of the power transistors, used in the implementation of inverters, as IGBT and MOSFET are
about 20 kHz and 1 MHz respectively (Rashid,
2001), while the excitation signal of the resolver sensor has a rated frequency less than 10
kHz (Staebler, 2000).
Considering the previous conditions, FDM can
be used to send one of the signal of the stator current
sensor and one output of the resolver sensor to the
same ADC, because both signals works with different
frequency bands. In consequence, only two ADCs are
needed to get the four analog signals, about currents
and angular position, for sensored vector control of
PMSM.
Figure 7 shows the proposed system to reduce
the number of ADCs in sensored vector control of
PMSM. The signals of the current and position sensors are conditioned (amplified and filtered). After
that, those signals are combined, using an adder
which can be easily implemented with an operational
amplifier. Two new signals, s1(t) and s2(t) are conformed and sent to the ADCs

s1 (t )  sv sin (t ) + sia (t )

(23)

s2 (t )  sv cos (t ) + sib (t )

(24)

3.2 Reduction of the Number of ADC using FDM
In communications systems, data is multiplied by
carrier signals with different frequencies in order to
locate data in different frequency bands (Roden,
1979). However, this procedure is not necessary for
applying FDM to the signals of the current and position sensors. Both signals have different bandwidths,
under the following considerations
 Figure 3 shows that the bandwidth of vsin(t) and
vcos(t) is small respect to the excitation frequency of the resolver sensor e.

Where svsin(t), svcos(t), sia(t) and sib(t) are the signals of the resolver and currents sensor after the conditioning process. According to FDM technique (Roden, 1979), the signals from the resolver sensor and
the current sensor are reconstructed by using bandpass filters and low-pass filters respectively. The angular position of the motor shaft can be obtained
from the reconstructed signals through different software-based techniques. This paper uses the feedback
tracking estimator described in (Kaewjinda and Kongirun, 2006) as illustrated in Figure 8.

3.3 FDM Technique Applied in Other Conditions
The concentration of the harmonics in the stator current near to multiples of the switching frequency also
happens in induction motors (Bose, 1997 Garcia et
Pinto, 2009). As a result, FDM can also be applied in
vector control of induction motors. On the other
hand, as the power spectrum of the stator currents
have low energy between those concentrations of
harmonics the excitation frequency of the resolver
sensor can be set in this region of the spectrum.

Figures 9, 10, 11 and 12 show the results for
speed control of the PMSM. The estimation of the
angular position and speed using the reconstructed
signal has high accuracy, allowing a precise speed
control. The reconstructed stator currents are also a
good estimative of the original signals.
Figures 13, 14, 15 and 16 show the results for
the position control. The estimation of the angular
position and speed is also precise. An error in the
position controller is obtained by the effect of the
load torque and the use of conventional PID controllers. However, this error is small, and can be reduced
by the application of better control techniques. The
errors in the estimative of the angular position and
speed of the PMSM depend on the configuration of
the position estimator shown in Figure 8.

estimation using FDM has less fluctuation due to the

The application of frequency domain multiplexing
can reduce the number of ADCs in speed or position
vector control of PMSM, reducing the cost and the
implementation time of the digital controllers. The
reconstructed signals of current and position sensors
allow the application of different closed-loop vector
control techniques for PMSM. Tests also demonstrate
that FDM can be applied in other machines as induction motors. As future work, closed-loop control of
electrical machines using FDM will be done.
