Abstract This work addresses the dynamic anti-windup design problem for a class of nonlinear_systems
subject to actuator saturation. The considered class regards the systems that can be cast in a differentialalgebraic representation (DAR), such as rational and polynomial systems. Considering that a nonlinear dynamic
output feedback controller, which can also be written as a DAR, has been designed to stabilize the nonlinear
system disregarding the saturation effects, LMI-based conditions are proposed to compute a dynamic anti-windup
compensator. The conditions ensure the local stability of the closed-loop system while providing the region
where the stability is ensured. A convex optimization problem is therefore proposed to compute the anti-windup
compensator in order to maximize the region of guaranteed asymptotic stability. This problem is implicitly
related to the maximization of the region of attraction of the closed-loop system. A numerical example is given
to illustrate the proposed method.

. This comes from
the fact that it is practically impossible to propose
generic techniques that would apply to any class
of nonlinear_systems. In this case, it is more reasonable to devise results concerning a particular
class of systems. This is the case for instance in
(Prempain et al., 2009 Wu et al., 2000) which considers anti-windup synthesis for linear-parameter
varying systems, in (Morabito et al., 2004) which
proposes anti-windup methods for Euler-Lagrange
systems, and in (Kahveci et al., 2007) which considers an adaptive_control design. We can also
cite some works dealing with the anti-windup
synthesis for systems with nonlinear dynamic inversion (NDI) controllers, such as the references
(Herrmann et al., 2009 Kendi and Doyle III, 1997
Kapoor and Daoutidis, 1999 Doyle III, 1999 Valmorbida et al., 2013).

Introduction

An efficient and practical way to mitigate undesirable effects of input saturation on performance
and stability of control closed-loop systems are
the so-called anti-windup techniques. Considering a pre-designed controller that stabilizes the
system disregarding the input saturation, the antiwindup compensation consists in feeding the controller with the difference between the actual value
of the input signal computed by the controller and
its saturated value through a static or dynamic
compensator (Zaccarian and Teel, 2011 S. Tarbouriech, G. Garcia, J. M. Gomes da Silva Jr. and
I. Queinnec, 2011). The modern anti-windup techniques are therefore concerned by providing systematic methods to compute these compensators
aiming at the performance improvement and the
guarantee of closed-loop stability (either in global
or regional contexts).
Considering linear models, the literature
is vast and provide many efficient approaches
to design stabilizing anti-windup compensators
(Tarbouriech and Turner, 2009 Teel and Kapoor,
1997 Galeani et al., 2009). On the other hand, for

In the present paper, we are interested in
devising a systematic way to compute stabilizing dynamic anti-windup compensators for a class
of nonlinear_systems whose behavior can be described by a differential algebraic representation

where x  Rnx denotes the state vector y  Rny
is the measured output u  Rnu is the control
input sat() is a classical vector-valued saturation function i.e. for i  1, . . . , nu sat(u(t))(i) 
sat(u(i) (t))  sign(u(i) (t)) minu(i) (t), u0(i) 
where u0(i) denotes the symmetric bound on the
ith component of vector u(t) fx  Rnx 7 Rnx ,
g  Rnx 7 Rnx nu and hy  Rnx 7 Rny are
rational functions of x .
Considering system (1), we assume that a possible dynamic output stabilizing compensator is
designed to guarantee some performance requirements and the stability of the closed-loop system
in the absence of control saturation. This controller is assumed to have also a rational dependence on its states and the output of system (1)
and can be generically described as follows

(DAR) (Trofino, 2000). This class encompasses
the class of polynomial and rational nonlinear
systems as well as other class of nonlinear_systems that can be convinietly written in a DAR
form by performing appropriate change of variables, e.g. some systems presenting trigonometric nonlinearities (see examples in (Coutinho
et al., 2004 Coutinho et al., 2008 Coutinho and
Gomes da Silva Jr., 2010)). The main advantage
of using DAR regards the fact that it is possible
to devise conditions based on state dependent linear matrix inequalites (LMIs). Considering systems described by DARs, in (Gomes da Silva Jr.
et al., 2014) the static antiwidup synthesis has
been addressed. The present work follows a similar approach to derive results to cope with dynamic anti-windup synthesis. In particular, it is
shown that the synthesis of a full order dynamic
anti-windup compensator can also be cast as a
state dependent LMI problem. The derived LMI
conditions can therefore be used to compute the
anti-windup compensator aiming at enlarging the
region of attraction of the closed-loop system.
This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we introduce the problem to be addressed
in the paper. Section 3 provides preliminary results concerning the system representation, the
Lyapunov theory, and the modified sector bound
condition. The main result is presented in section 4, while the computation of the anti-windup
compensator by means of an optimization problem is stated in section 4.1. A numerical example
is given in section 5 demonstrating the potentialities of the proposed approach. Section 6 ends the
paper with some concluding remarks.

Considering the above setup, the main objective of this work is to derive LMI conditions
to design the anti-windup compensator (3), i.e.
to compute matrices Aa , Ba , Ca and Da in order
to guarantee the regional stability of the closedloop system obtained by the interconnection of
(1), (5) and (3). Once LMI conditions have been
derived, we therefore cast them in a convex optimization problem to maximize an ellipsoidal region of asymptotic stability for the closed-loop
system. This problem aims at implicitly maximizing the basin of attraction of the closed-loop system through the design of the anti-windup compensator.

where a  B  B , B  Rn , is a locally Lipschitz function such that a(0)  0. Suppose there
exist positive scalars 1 , 2 and 3 , and a continuously differentiable function V  B 7 R satisfying
the following conditions

where   Rn and n  nx + n + nxa .
It follows (Coutinho et al., 2004), (Durola
et al., 2008) that the closed-loop system can always be conveniently cast in a Differential Algebraic Representation (DAR) given as follows

where z  Rnz is an auxiliary nonlinear vector
function of (x, ) containing rational and polynomial terms (having terms of order equal or larger
than two) of fx (x)+ g(x)u  g(x), hy (x), f (, y)
and of h (, y) and Aa  Rn n , Ab  Rn nz ,
Ac  Rn nu , a  Rnz n , b  Rnz nz ,

then, V () is a Lyapunov function in B . Moreover, for all (0)  R the trajectory (t) belongs
to R and approaches the origin as t  .
The region R is therefore a region of guaranteed asymptotic stability (RAS) of the origin, i.e.
R is contained in the basin of attraction of the
closed-loop system.

Generalized Sector Bound Condition

Consider G1 ()  Rnu n and G2 ()  Rnu n ,
two affine matrix functions of . Define now the
following set


S    Rn  (K1(i) ()G1(i) ())+(K2(i) ()
 G2(i) ()))  u0 , i  1, . . . , nu  . (11)
From the deadzone nonlinearity (u) in (4)
and the set S as above defined, the following Lemma can be stated (Gomes da Silva Jr.
et al., 2014).
Lemma 2 If   S then the relation

where K1 (x)  Rnu n , K2 (x)  Rnu n ,

Regarding representation of the closed-loop
system given by (6)-(7), we assume that
(A1) the origin is an equilibrium point
(A2) for a domain B  Rn , containing the
origin in its interior the existence and uniqueness
of the solutions of (6)-(7) is ensured.
(A3) the matrix functions b (x) and 2 (x)
has full rank for all   B .

(u) T (u)  G1 ()  G2 ()  0

is verified for any matrix T  Rnu nu diagonal
and positive definite.
Considering deadzone nonlinearities, the relation (12) can be viewed as a generalized sector condition which encompasses the classical one
used, for instance, in (Kiyama and Iwasaki, 2000).
The generalized sector condition is known to be
less conservative than the classical one when assessing the stability of systems subject to actuator saturation (Gomes da Silva Jr. and Tarbouriech, 2005).

Hence if V () as above defined satisfies the conditions (8)-(10), for all x  B and R  B , then

At this point is important to define the region

convex polytopic region containing the origin in
its interior. Hence, B can be described by a set
of scalar inequalities as follows

can be alternatively described by the convex hull
of its vertices, where the notation V(B ) denotes
the set of vertices of B .
In this case, to ensure that the region R defined in (14) is indeed a stability_region provided
(28) is satisfied, we have ensure that R is contained in S  B . The inclusion R  S holds if

The result given in Theorem 3 can be applied for
computing a dynamic anti-windup compensator in
order to attempt a maximization of the region of

goal is implicitly achieved if we maximize the region R associated to the compensator to be computed.
In general, we are interested in maximizing

optimization problem stated by (Gomes da Silva
Jr. et al., 2014), we have first determined the region of attraction of the closed-loop system with
static anti-windup compensation. Then, we have
applied the optimization problem (39) to estimate
the region of attraction of the same system with
a dynamic anti-windup compensator. Figure 1
shows a comparison among them. In the dynamic
anti-windup case, the obtained region R is defined
by



Hence, the idea is to maximize Rx . With this aim,
consider an auxiliary matrix M and the following

Concluding Remarks



0.5

This paper has presented an LMI-based approach
to compute dynamic anti-windup compensators
for a class of nonlinear_systems subject to actuator saturation. The approach relies on a
differential-algebraic representation of nonlinear
systems, which can model a broad class of nonlinear_systems. To deal with the saturation, a
generalized sector bound condition has been considered. Based on the derived LMI conditions,
this paper has particularly focused on the problem of enlarging the region of attraction of the
closed-loop system through the synthesis of the
anti-windup compensator. This problem has been
indirectly addressed from a convex optimization
problem that allows to design a compensator leading to the maximization of an ellipsoidal region of
stability (i.e. an estimate of the basin of attraction). It has been shown in an numerical example, that the extra degrees of freedom introduced
by the dynamic compensator can lead to improvements regarding the size and the transient performance of the system when compared with static
anti-windup schemes. The extension of the approach to deal explicitly with performance optimization, in terms of a L2 -gain criterion, is an
ongoing work.

with static anti-windup (dashed line) and without
the anti-windup strategy (dash-dotted line).
Although the shape of the ellipsoids are different, we can note that the area of region Rx
obtained with the dynamic anti-windup is slightly
bigger than the one obtained with the static antiwindup.
Considering now the initial condition (depicted in Figure 1 by a bullet)
