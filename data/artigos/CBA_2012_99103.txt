Abstract This paper proposes the implementation of an optimal controller for a variable speed conveyor belt system. A statespace model based on experimental data provides a basis for the controller design. The optimal feedback matrix obtained with
such model helps determining an ideal control signal for the operation of the conveyor belt at a single operating point. The
experimental results show that the Linear Quadratic Regulator is ideal when the system operates with fixed speed, thus requiring
an integral action to assure the follow-up reference in variable speed drives. In this case, the controller is called Linear Quadratic
Integrator, which has shown to be effective in the variable speed control with or without the insertion of load.
Keywords Conveyor Belt, Variable Speed Control, Linear Quadratic Regulator, Linear Quadratic Integral.

Introduction

In process control at industrial level, field
operators typically act directly in the plant. However,
the control system may become quite complex as a
great number of variables to be monitored and
controlled are involved. In the last few decades,
different types of controllers have been proposed to
control motor speed e.g. the traditional PID
controller, adaptive drivers, intelligent algorithms
and drivers that enable optimal control of the process
quickly, efficiently and effectively. Zanoelo (2008)
proposes the control speed of a conveyor belt in the
drying process of mate leaves, based on the amount
of units transported in the hot air blown over the
leaves and the temperature measured on the belt
surface. The idea is to increase or reduce the
displacement speed of the system using the
traditional PI controller so that the leaves are nearly
dried from 2.4 to 3.4. Considering the
implementation of adaptive_control algorithms, the
work proposed by Dias (2010a) uses a self-tuning PI
controller obtained from the control law named
Generalized Minimum Variance (GMV) to tune the
proportional gain kp and the integral gain ki. Ristic

(2012) considers that the loading capacity of the
material on the belt is fixed and that the feed rate of
material to be transported is random, in his article
uses fuzzy logic to maintain the amount of product
transported constant from variable speed drives and
obtained satisfactory results. There study developed
by Ruderman (2008) also uses optimal control
applied to the speed control of a DC motor based on
the feedback of speed and current, with satisfactory
results for different reference values.
From the state-space model the of the conveyor
belt system, this work proposes the implementation
of a speed control loop based on the theory of
optimal
controllers.
The
application
this
methodology is based which parametric variations
caused by wear, friction, variations in the transported
load that directly influence the dynamics of the
system. In this case, Linear Quadratic Regulator
(LQR) and Linear Quadratic Integrator (LQI) based
on an array of state feedback with fixed gain are used
to generate a control signal for the ideal operating
system. From the analysis of experimental results, it
is possible to verify the performance of such
controllers during the operation at multiple speeds,
with the presence or absence of load.
Therefore, this paper presents the conveyor belt
drive system in section 2. Data collected from the

system allow obtaining the state space model with
the proper representation of the system dynamics.
Section 3 presents the design of LQR and LQI
controllers. Experimental results regarding the speed
control are discussed in section 4. Finally, section 5
presents the remarkable conclusions.
2 Conveyor Belt System
2.1 Description and Type of Drive
Conveyor belts are drive systems used to
continuous transport of materials and are presents in
various industrial sectors.
Junior (2005) mentions that the drive systems
have high power consumption and are widely used.
Therefore, researches on industrial process control
are required to optimize the operation of such
systems. In this case, the Department of Electrical
Engineering, Federal University of Ceará (UFC)
created the Laboratory for Energy Efficiency in
Industry Driving Systems (LAMOTRIZ), with
financial and technical support provided by
Eletrobrás (Lamotriz, 2012). The conveyor belt
utilized is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Bench representing the conveyor belt.

The stand of the conveyor belt consists of four
forming a closed path of 10.8 meters and each belt
has two possible drives the direct start-up using the
ac power grid and by using a frequency converter, as
shown in Figure 2.

directly connected to the grid and the shaft is coupled
to a gearbox whose output torque is high and nearly
constant when load condition changes (Magalhães,
2009). In this case, the speed belt is a function of the
grid frequency and the reduction ratio of the
gearbox. When a frequency converter is used in the
IM drive, the shaft is directly connected to the
conveyor belt, while a gearbox is not used. The
variable speed is determined by the frequency of the
inverter output voltage (Magalhães, 2008).
The Figure 3 shows the main components used
in the drive system i.e. a microcomputer, a data
acquisition card National Instruments, frequency
converter and IM.

Figure 3. Schematic representing the conveyor belt drive systems.

The algorithms for system identification and
controllers are developed and implemented in the
computer using Real-Time Interface (RTI) software
developed at Matlab . A data acquisition card NI
(Nidaq 6009) communication with the computer via
the USB bus receives a digital signal, coming from
an encoder (IFM  RB6005) fixed to the drive motor
of the conveyor belt through a photo coupler circuit
(4N25) and an analog signal electrical current
proportional to motor power. The power of the
encoder is made through a 24 VDC source and the
signal sent by the same has the same value. Since the
card only receives the maximum voltage of 5 volts, it
was necessary to use a photo coupler circuit to
reduce the level of voltage of 24 volts to 5 volts. In
addition the reception of analog and digital signals,
the data acquisition board sends an analog voltage in
the range of 0-5 volts to the analog port of the
frequency converter Altivar 31 which in turn drives
the motor with drive exerts traction on the belt
variable speed. The analog input of the frequency
converter may receive a signal voltage in the range
0-10 volts equivalent 0-60 Hz. For safety reasons,
the maximum value sent by the card voltage is 1.5
volts, which causes the belt is traveling at a speed of
approximately 1.3 ms, satisfactory within an
industrial environment.
Therefore, as discussed in this section, the
variable speed control is only possible when indirect
drives are considered. The next section presents with
the modeling and identification system of the belt.
2.2 System Identification
The application of the control strategy requires
the knowledge of system modeling and
identification. In this case, this process is divided
into four basic steps (Rocha, 2008)

In direct drives, also known as the conventional
form, the three-phase induction motor (IM) is

 Dynamic tests and data collection Initially, the
system is supposed to be properly arranged for startup.
Dias (2010b) mentions that a step-type input can
be applied during data collection, what allows the
operation at a given point. The relay method can also
be used as the input signal, causing the system to
oscillate around a given operating point, while
oscillation gain (Ku) and the oscillation period (Tu)
can be obtained to properly tune PID controllers. In
addition, one should consider the signal named
Pseudo Random Binary Sequence (PRBS), which
causes the system to operate according to two
voltage levels generated at random time intervals and
predetermined. Finally, there is the Analog Signal
Pseudo Random Sequence (PRAS), which has the
same characteristics of PRBS, but with the advantage
of generating random and uniform values within an
interval a,b, with a<b. A sampling rate of 0.5 s was
used and, which was defined after several evaluation
tests. Signal PRAS is chosen to perform data
collection and the step signal is adopted during the
evaluation of the controllers.
 Definition of the model structure The choice of
the model order should reflect the physical
understanding of the system. The simplified model
AutoRegressive with External Input (ARX) was
adopted according to Wellstead (1991).
A( z 1 ) y (k )  z  d B( z 1 )u (k )

(1)

where na and nb represent the degree of the
polynomials A( z 1 ) and B( z 1 ) , respectively d
represent delay, and u(k) and y(k) represent the
voltage signal sent to the analog port and the drive
speed of the conveyor belt, respectively.
 Estimation of parameters In order to determine
the parameters or coefficients for polynomials A( z 1 )
and B( z 1 ) , specific identification algorithms are
supposed to be used. In this case, the classic nonrecursive least squares algorithm (Coelho, 2004) was
chosen. Based on this approach, models of 1st, 2nd
and 3rd orders were tested considering performance
indices such as mean square error (MSQ) and
multiple correlation coefficient (R), given in
equations (2) and (3), respectively.

By analyzing the parameter estimation in Table
1, it can be observed that the first order model has a
higher estimation error MSE and lower value of R
than the other ones, as this model was not considered
in the study. Comparing the models of 2nd and 3rd
orders, it appears that the values for the performance
indices are very close to each other. However, the 2nd
order model provides the best results for RMS.
Furthermore, it is quantitatively more suitable to the
system design, because the higher order system
model makes the tuning process of controllers more
complex. Therefore, it has the following format

3 Optimal Control Strategies
3.1 LQR Controller
The LQR controller is based on an array formed
by feedback control gains whose parameters allow
optimal control of the system to ensure optimal
performance, according to Figure 4.

(13)

Skogestad (2005) shows that the simplification
of equation (11) is obtained when matrix K is
represented as follows
K  R 1 G T P

(14)

where matrix P is the single positive definite solution
of the reduced Riccatis matrix equation given by
(Ogata, 1995) as
F T P  PF  PGR 1G T P  Q  0

(15)

Therefore, the following values can be obtained
for the optimal feedback matrix
k   0.2598 0.1095
Figure 4. Block diagram representing the LQR controller.

The process is represented by the following
discrete state space equations
x ( k  1)  Fx ( k )  Gu ( k )

(8)

y (k  1)  Hx(k  1)

(9)

where F is the state matrix, G is a the system input
matrix, H is the system output matrix, x is the state
vector, y(k) is the system output. The following
control law can then be derived
u (k )  e(k )  Kx(k )

(10)

where u(k) is the control signal, e(k) is the error
between the reference r(k) and the system output
y(k), and K is the optimal feedback matrix obtained
by minimizing the cost function described by (Ogata,
1995) as
J LQR 



1  T
 x (k )Qx(k )  u T (k ) Ru(k )

(11)

The weighting matrices Q and R in equation (11)
are symmetric positive definite or real. The first
matrix is associated with the system states, while the
second one represents the energy consumption at the
plant input. Filho (2006) mentions that the weighting
matrices can be found From heuristic methods as the
method of Bryson or through the use of evolutionary
computation, specifically using genetic algorithms.
However, values of Q and R can be defined by the
system designer based on dynamic required to
process. In this case, the following equations are
defined

(16)

where in the first coefficient matrix, k1 considering
the system output (velocity in ms) and the second k 2
considering the electric current supply to the electric
motor.
Finally, the correct tuning of weighting matrices
Q and R at a specific operating point of the system
ensures robustness against external disturbances,
such as the inclusion of loads on the conveyor belt.
The influence of internal disturbances is also
minimized, such as noise in data collection, because
the control signal generated by the controller is a
function of two states of the system i.e. the electric
current in the motor and speed of the conveyor belt
(Dias, 2011). However, if the system operates at
different operating points for which the controller is
tuned, it does not seem to be efficient, while offset
error results. Due to this fact, Kedjar (2007) and Dias
(2011) suggest the inclusion of an integral action to
eliminate the steady state error. In this configuration
the LQR controller is called LQI (Linear Quadratic
Integrator), as described in the next subsection.
3.2 Controller LQI
The LQI controller design is based on the LQR
controller i.e. the control system is achieved by state
feedback with the insertion of an integral action to
ensure closed-loop tracking of the reference (Ogata,
1995). Figure 5 shows the block diagram of the
controller.

(12)
Figure 5. Block diagram representing the LQI controller.

4478

Anais do XIX Congresso Brasileiro de Automática, CBA 2012.

Therefore, the control law LQI is defined as
u ( k )   kx ( k )  k I ei ( k )

(17)

where ei (k ) is the error at the integrator output and
the values of k and k I define the feedback gain of
the system states and the feedback gain of the
integral action, respectively.
Substituting equation (8) in (9), the following
expression results
y (k  1)  H  Fx(k )  Gu (k )

(18)

where the error at the integrator output is given by
ei (k  1)  ei (k )  r (k  1)  y ( k  1)

R   0.1

(26)

(27)

By considering the new system matrices F and
in
equations (14) and (15), and using matrices Q
G
and R for the LQI controller given in equations (26)
and (27), respectively, the new feedback vector k is
defined as
k   0.5028 0.149 0.2226

(28)

where k I  0.2226 is the gain for the integral action.

(19)

From equations (18) and (19), the new
expression that represents the output of the integral
action becomes
ei (k  1)   HFx(k )  ei (k )  HGu (k )  r (k  1)

0 
0.01 0

Q 0 1

 0 0 0.065

Once the gain matrices for the LQR and LQI
controllers are defined, the next section is supposed
to present the experimental implementation of each
controller to verify the performance of the speed
control in the conveyor belt.

This section presents some experimental results
obtained during the implementation of controllers
LQR and LQI. The operation of the conveyor belt
with variable speed and good reference tracking
independently of the operating point andor load
conditions based on the control strategies described
in Section 3 are desired. Initially, LQR was used,
while the conveyor belt speed is 0.6 ms, as shown in
Figure 6.

Figure 6. Conveyor belt speed using LQR for a step of 0.6

Figure 6 shows that the controller is effective in
the speed control with stable output. However, the
belt speed does not follow the reference at 0.6 ms, it
equals 0.5 ms. Multiple steps for the speed were
applied i.e. 0.5, 0.7, 0.3, and 1.0 ms, and the results
are presented in Figure 7.

Once again, weighting matrices Q and R were
defined through experimental tests, providing
satisfactory performance of the process output

The second experiment with the LQI controller
is supposed to verify the performance at different
speeds, and the results are shown in Figure 9.

Figure 7. Conveyor belt speed using LQR for multiple steps
(0.5, 0.7, 0.3, and 1.0 ms) without load.

From Figure 7, it can be seen that overshoot
occurs when the reference values are changed, whose
amplitude is related to difference corresponding to
the reference step. Analogously to the previous
experimental result, LQR controller presents steady
state error at some speeds according to Table 2.

Unlike the results obtained with LQR, the
reference values were satisfactorily tracked without
overshoot related to changes in the setpoints.
The performance of the controller when the
system is subjected to a given load is demonstrated
in Figures 10 and 11.

25.86

However, Figure 7 and Table 2 show that the
LQR controller achieved reference tracking at 0.3
ms. Besides, the steady state error increases as the
operating point move away from such reference
point. Therefore, the tuning of LQR is optimal at 0.3
ms, while significant tracking error exists at other
operating points. Since the proposal of this work is to
investigate the performance of the variable speed
drive, the same test conditions were adopted using
LQI controller and the results are shown in Figure 8.

Figure 8. Conveyor belt seed using LQI for a step of 0.6 ms
without load.

One can see in Figure 8 that the integral action
provides null in the steady state error. Besides, the
controller acts in a smooth way, which is an
advantageous for this type of system, because sudden
changes of speed decrease the lifetime of the
equipment and increase the risk of accidents.

Figure 11. Control signal using LQI and considering the
presence of a given load

The test results show that the speed is reduced to
0.47 ms during the positive load step, and it takes
about 6.5 s to reassume the reference value due to
smooth action of the controller. When there is a
negative load step, the speed increases to 0.73 ms
and it takes 9.0 s to reassume the reference value.
However, it can be seen that the speed has tracked
the reference value satisfactorily due to the increase
4480

and decrease of the control signal amplitude, as
shown in Figure 11.
Finally, Figures 12 and 13 present the results for
the tests in which the speed and load conditions are
varied, respectively. It can be seen that the LQI
controller acts satisfactorily in reference tracking at
all speed, even in the presence of distinct load
conditions.

Figure 12. Conveyor belt speed using LQI for multiple steps
(0.5, 0.7, 0.3, and 1.0 ms) and considering the presence of a given
load.

The table 3 illustrates that the PI controller, at
0.6 ms, is more efficient than the LQI, with values
of lower variance. However, the operating point of
0.3 ms, the LQI showed a better efficiency in order
that their weighting matrices are tuned to this speed
reference.
5 Conclusions
The modeling and system identification of the
conveyor belt in the state space have been introduced
in this paper in order to implement the speed control
loop based on the theory of optimal controllers LQR
and LQI. Through experimental tests with and
without the presence of load, it was possible to
investigate the performance of each one of the
aforementioned controllers. For the tests without
load, the LQR controller has shown to be effective in
maintaining the system output stable for different
values of speed. However, steady state error with
regards to the reference value results, except at 0.3
ms. The process of adjusting the weighting matrices
Q and R were performed by adding an integrating
action to the system, resulting in the LQI controller
and consequently leading to the increased of the
system order. In this case, the LQI controller has
been able to track the reference successfully, thus
eliminating the steady state error. Considering the
tests with distinct load conditions, the performance
of the LQI controller has shown to be effective at
variable speed operation.

Finally, it is verified the efficiency of the LQI
controller for a traditional PI when the system works
at 0.3 ms and 0.6 ms, with and without load, by
analysis of variance of the control signal. The PI
