ogies, can reach high degree of reliability. Moreover,
lower prices of power switches and new semiconductor technologies, as well as the current demand on
high performance inverters have extended the applications of multilevel converters (Daher, 2006).
Reference (Daher, 2006) presents the use of
multilevel topologies in a 3kVA off-grid PV system
with an efficiency of 96. Aiming to extend the use
of multilevel topologies in low power systems this
paper presents a single phase 3kVA, low frequency
operation, high efficiency, high power factor, and
high quality output voltage waveform Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS). The proposed system consists a double conversion UPS, where the first conversion stage is composed by an active Power Factor
Correction (PFC) rectifier and the second conversion
stage is composed by a sinusoidal output voltage
multilevel inverter. Fig. 1 shows the proposed UPS
topology. UPS circuit description, operation description topology as well as experimental results for grid
mode operation (no battery bank) are presented here.

Introduction

Multilevel converters have been mainly used in
medium or high power systems applications, such as
static reactive power compensation and adjustable
speed drives. In these applications, due to limitations
of current available power semiconductor technology, multilevel concepts are usually the unique alternative because it is based on low frequency switching and also provide voltage andor current sharing
between the power semiconductors (H. Ertl, et al.,
2002 Calais, et al., 1999 Tolbert, et al., 2000). On
the other hand, for small power systems (<10 kW),
multilevel converters have been competing with high
frequency PWM converters in applications where
high efficiency is of major importance. It is well
know that high temperature is one factor that decreases lifetime of many components (Tolbert, et al.,
2000  Daher, 2006). Taking this into account, it is
expected that high efficiency (therefore less heat and
lower temperature) topologies, like multilevel topolDC BUS

2 UPS Circuit Description
The proposed UPS is composed by a rectifier
with active PFC based on boost converter connected
through a DC bus to the multilevel inverter. The
multilevel inverter topology proposed by (Daher,
2006) is adopted in this work. The battery charge is
based on the classical buck converter. The step-up
converter is based on classical boost converter and it
is responsible to step of battery voltage bank up to
the DC bus voltage. In this paper is made only a grid
mode operation analysis.
2.1 Boost Converter Analysis

PFC Boost
Converter

The first stage of the UPS is composed by a
classical boost converter. This topology is used because it has the advantage to be simple and to use
few component (reducing the weight and space). The
Boost converter is controlled using conventional
average current-mode-control implemented with the
well-known PWM integrated circuit UC3854 for
power factor correction (Todd, 1994). Fig. 2 shows
the circuit and control block diagram of the boost
converter.

Fig. 3  Block diagram of the multilevel inverter control

The controller is based on an 8-bit AT90S8535
microcontroller (running at 11.0592 MHz) from
ATMEL. The control program was developed in C
language, and all switch signals were implemented in
lookup tables stored in the microcontroller internal
memory. According to the DC bus voltage and output current, it was possible to adjust the output voltage by changing the lookup table. A total of 16 lookup tables were implemented (33, 35, . . . , 63 levels). Fig. 3 shows the block diagram of the inverter
control.
3.2 Principle of Operation
The principle of operation of the inverter will be
describe using a structure with an output stage composed by only two cells, as shown in Fig. 4.

As shown in Fig. 1, the used inverter includes 3
main components one H-bridge converter, one multi-winding transformer and one output stage. The Hbridge converter receives voltage from a DC source,
supplied by boost PFC, and generates a square waveform at line frequency that is applied to the primary
of the transformer. The transformer operates at line
frequency and it has only one primary and a several
output coils. These coils are electrically isolated from
each other, thus producing several partial AC square
waveform. The output stage combines these partial
voltage in order to produced the sinusoidal output
voltage.

 2 Stage  The switches Sa and Sd are
turned-on, thus the primary winding receives positive

the output voltage is equal the coil 1 voltage. Hence
the output voltage is Vi. This operation stage is

Hence the output voltage is 2Vi. This operation stage
is shown in Fig. 5 (c).
 4 Stage  The switches Sa, Sd remain on.
The switches S1 and S3 are turned-on. The coil 2 and
coil 1 are connected in series, then the output voltage
is equal the coil 1 plus coil 2 voltage. Hence the
output voltage is 3Vi. This operation stage is shown
in Fig. 5 (d).
 5 Stage  This stage is equal to stage 3. In
this moment, the output waveform start to down its
level. This operation stage is shown in Fig. 5 (c).

 7 Stage  This stage is equal to stage 1.
This operation stage is shown in Fig. 5 (e).
 8 Stage  The switches Sa and Sd are
turned-off and the switches Sb and Sc are turned-on,
thus the primary winding receives negative voltage.
The switches S2 and S3 are turned-on, then the output voltage is equal the coil 1 voltage. Hence the
output voltage is -Vi. This operation mode is shown
in Fig. 5 (f).
 9 Stage  The switches Sb, Sc remain on,
thus the primary winding still continues under negative voltage. The switches S1 and S4 are turned-on,
then the output voltage is equal the coil 2 voltage.
Hence the output voltage is -2Vi. This operation
stage is shown in Fig. 5 (g).
 10 Stage  The switches Sb, Sc remain on,
thus the primary winding still continues under negative voltage. The switches S1 and S3 are turned-on.
The coil 2 and coil 1 are connected in series, then the
output voltage is equal the coil 1 plus coil 2 voltage.
Hence the output voltage is -3Vi. This operation
stage is shown in Fig. 5 (h).
 11 Stage  This stage is equal to stage 9.
This operation stage is shown in Fig. 5 (g).

A general presentation of a 3kVA uninterrupted
power supply on the grid mode operation has been
presented. A brief description of the topology in
study, the design procedure and the experimental
results were performed with the emphasis on the
possibility to applied a multilevel inverter to UPS.
The use of multilevel inverters in UPS presents
as advantages the high efficiency and robustness
added to the system, such as the possibility of using
low frequency in the sinusoidal wave generation,
which reduces electromagnetic interference generated within the converter thus decreasing the interference possibility in systems with high susceptibility
to EMI.
