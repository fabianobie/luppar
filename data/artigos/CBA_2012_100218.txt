Introduction

In recent years, chaos synchronization has been
applied in several areas such as in electrical engineering (Xiao, 2009 Iu and Tse, 2000), biological systems (Arecchi et al., 2003), chemical engineering (Li
et. al., 2003) and secure communications (Lu et al,
2002 Sun et al., 2008).
Several methods have been proposed to achieve
synchronization. For instance, nonlinear active control (Wang et al., 2009a, 2009b Wang, 2010 Chen
et al., 2009 Yan, 2005 Vincent, 2008 Yassen,
2008), adaptive synchronization (Al-Sawada et al,
2010 Yang, 2011 Li, 2010 Ye and Deng, 2012),
backstepping design (Zhang et al., 2005 Njah and
Sunday, 2009 Peng and Chen, 2008), and sliding
mode control (Jang, 2002 Liu et al., 2009 Chen et
al., 2007).
However, in most of the above works, it is assumed that the slave and master systems are perfectly
or structurally known, i.e., the presence of unknown
disturbances is not considered. For instance, the
techniques in Al-Sawada et al. (2010), Yang (2011),
Li (2010), Ye and Deng (2012), Dou et. al. (2009),
and Mahmoud (2012) achieve asymptotic convergence of the synchronization error to zero under the
crucial assumption of the inexistence of disturbances.
Although the assumption of free disturbance may be
interesting from the theoretical point of view, from
the practical perspective it is a restrictive assumption
since the presence of disturbances are, in general,
unavoidable. Typical disturbances include statedependent and time-dependent functions, which can

be introduced, for instance, by unexpected changes in
the system dynamic due faults, changes in operation
conditions, aging of equipment, and so on.
On the other hand, it is well-known that adaptive
laws designed for the disturbance or modeling error
free case may suffer from parameter drift. In fact, this
lack of robustness in adaptive systems in the presence
of unmodeled dynamics or bounded disturbances was
reported in the early 1980s. Several robust modifications to counteract this have been proposed since then
(Ioannou and Sun, 1995).
Motivated by the previous facts, in this paper we
propose an adaptive synchronization method for unified chaotic systems in the presence of uncertain system parameter and bounded disturbances. Based on
Lyapunov-like analysis, the proposed controller ensures the convergence of the synchronization error to
zero, even in the presence of uncertain system parameter and bounded disturbances.
2 Problem Formulation
Consider the problem of control unified chaotic
systems described by the following differential equation

x s  A(  ) xs + f s ( xs ) + d s ( xs , t ) + u

(1)

where x s  3 is the state of the slave system,

u  3 is the control input, f s (.) is a known map,

d s (.) is an unknown disturbance and  is an unknown parameter,

where

d m0 < d ms and d ms is a known constant.
Hence, our aim is to design a feedback control u,
such that the state xs of the slave chaotic system (1)
tracks of the state xm of the master system (5).
Define the synchronization error e(t )  xs  xm .
Then, from (1) and (5), we obtain the synchronization
error equation

Remark 3 It should be noted that in our formulation,
for sake of simplicity, it was considered that

can be unrelated, for instance, to include a priori
knowledge of the disturbances.

Assumption 2 The parameter  is upper bounded
by a known positive constant  , such that  >  .

3 Adaptive Synchronization

Remark 1 Assumption 1 is quite natural since unified chaotic systems are bounded by definition.
Remark 2 In case that  0,  0.8, and  1, system (1) becomes the Lorenz, L, and Chen systems,
respectively, when perturbations are not present.
In order to have a well-posed problem, without
loss of generality, we consider the master system as

x m  A( ) xm + f m ( xm ) + d m (t , xm )

(5)

where x m   3 ,  is a known parameter and d m (.)
is an unknown disturbance.

In this section, we considered the problem of asymptotic adaptive synchronization in the presence of
unknown parameter and bounded disturbances. It is
shown using Lyapunov-like analysis that the synchronization error converges asymptotically to zero.
Theorem 1 Consider the slave (1) and master (5)

Then, the slave and master systems synchronize,
i.e., lim t  e(t )  0.

On the other hand, by using (11), the closed-loop

(17)

By evaluating (16) along the trajectories of (13)
and (17), we obtain

Simulations

To illustrate the application of the proposed
scheme, the Chen chaotic system was considered.
However, in contrast to Al-Sawada et al. (2010),
Yang (2011), Li (2010), Ye and Deng (2012), Dou
et. al. (2009), and Mahmoud (2012), we consider
here the presence of the following disturbance



d s ( x s , t )  3 sin( t ). x s

(25)

Hence, to synchronize the slave system (1) and the
master system (5), the adaptive laws (11)-(13) were
used. The initial conditions for the master and slave
systems were x m  1.5 2 5 and x s  4 8 3 ,
respectively, in order to evaluate the performance of
the proposed synchronization algorithm under adverse initial conditions.
The Chen system, i.e.   1 , was considered for
the simulation. The others design parameter were
chosen as k  1 ,  (0 )  0 ,   0.001 ,   1 ,

It should be noted that   1 is only used for gen-

eration of state trajectory xs (t ) . For the implementation of the control law (11), it is assumed that   1
is unknown.
The performances in the synchronization are
shown in Figures 1-6, where a logarithmic scale is
used for the time axis to show the fast transient. We
can see that the simulations confirm the theoretical
results, that is, the synchronization algorithm is stable
and the synchronization error is very small.

5 Conclusions
This paper has proposed a synchronization algorithm to unified chaotic systems that can be affected
by uncertainty in the parameter and bounded disturbances. The proposed scheme guarantees the asymptotical convergence of the synchronization error to
zero.
