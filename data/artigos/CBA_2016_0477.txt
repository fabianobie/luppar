Abstract This paper investigates the problem of H robust full order filter design for continuous-time
uncertain systems in polytopic domains. A matrix inequality condition with a scalar is proposed for the filter
design. The condition becomes a linear matrix inequality (LMI) for fixed values of the scalar parameter. The
matrices of the filter are obtained through LMI relaxations that consider polynomially parameter-dependent
decision variables of arbitrary degree. As main characteristic, the approach contains and generalizes the quadratic
stability based LMI condition from the literature, providing the optimal H filter for precisely known systems.
Additionally, numerical examples show that the proposed relaxations may require less computational effort in
order to provide similar H bounds for uncertain systems when compared with other methods from the literature.

Introduction

Over the last decades, the modeling of dynamical
systems in several areas of control engineering has
incorporated more complex assumptions on physical components, for instance, taking into account
the presence of uncertainties. To cope with more
sophisticated models, one of the main strategies
relies on the Lyapunov stability theory, that has
been employed to solve a wide range of problems
in terms of convex optimization based on Linear
Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) (Boyd et al., 1994).
The LMI framework was first used in the context of robust stability analysis, exploring the
concept of quadratic stability, i.e., a constant
Lyapunov matrix is used to certify the stability of the whole domain of uncertainty. Then,
extensions were provided to deal with the controller and filtering design problems. Although
quadratic stability provides optimal full order controllers and filters in the sense of some performance criteria, such as the H2 and the H norms,
for precisely known systems, the results may be
conservative in the uncertain case. As a consequence, robust stability analysis conditions based
on affine parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions (de Oliveira et al., 1999 Leite and Peres,
2003) have been employed to reduce the conservativeness and lately, polynomial parameterdependent Lyapunov functions of arbitrary degree
further improved the results by means of convergent LMI relaxations (Bliman, 2004 Oliveira
et al., 2008).

The filtering problem is an important topic
in signal processing and control theory that has
been investigated for a long time. Although the
Kalman filter theory provides the optimal unbiased estimate of the unknown state for the
discrete-time system in terms of minimum variance error, if one considers the presence of uncertainties in the model, the filter can no longer
assure such optimality property. In addition, the
Kalman filter theory has limitations regarding the
noise input, which is required to be Gaussian.
Due to the aforementioned reasons, control
engineers have been focused on developing extensions and generalizations for the Kalman filter. Therefore, alternative ways to deal with the
filtering problem were proposed and one of the
most popular approaches is the LMI based technique, that has provided synthesis conditions for
filter design based on quadratic stability in the
continuous-time case (Geromel and de Oliveira,
2001 Geromel, 1999 de Souza et al., 2000),
discrete-time case (Geromel et al., 2000) and systems with delays (Zhong, 2006), generally using
the H and H2 norms of the transfer matrix from
the input noise to the estimated output error as
performance criteria.
Recently, filter design conditions which are
more general and can provide less conservative results have been proposed (Duan et al., 2006 Gao
et al., 2008 Lacerda et al., 2011). Those conditions make use of extra degrees of freedom provided by scalar parameters, that can be useful to
provide less conservative results, at the expense of

increasing the computational burden.
This paper proposes a new LMI based design
condition for H filtering of continuous-time linear systems, which can be viewed as an extension of the LMIs with a scalar parameter proposed in (Morais et al., 2013) for the problem
of robust stabilization. The approach contains
and generalizes the quadratic stability based conditions for filter design, always yielding less conservative H guaranteed costs and providing the
optimal H filter when precisely known systems
are investigated. Moreover, the conditions may require less computational effort to provide similar
bounds when compared to other available conditions for robust filtering. The matrices of the dynamic filter are obtained in terms of some blocks
of the slack variables of the problem, allowing
both the Lyapunov matrix and other blocks of
the slack variables to be polynomially parameterdependent. This approach can be useful to further
reduce the conservativeness of the proposed condition in the case of uncertain systems. Numerical
examples illustrate the results.

Preliminaries

Consider the robustly stable uncertain linear continuous time-invariant system described by
x(t)  A( )x(t) + B1( )w(t)
z(t)  C1 ( )x(t) + D11 ( )w(t)
y(t)  C2 ( )x(t) + D21 ( )w(t)

(1)

with A( )  Rnn , B1 ( )  Rnr , C1 ( )  R pn ,
D11 ( )  R pr , C2 ( )  Rqn , D21 ( )  Rqr ,
where x  Rn is the state vector, w  Rr is the
noise input, z  R p is the output to be estimated
and y  Rq represents the measured output. The
matrices of the system are supposed to belong to
a polytope defined by
N

X  R( )  R( )   i Ri ,
i1

where R( ) represents any matrix of system (1),
Ri are given matrices (vertices of the polytope), N
is the number of vertices and the parameter  lies
in the unit simplex of dimension N, given by
N

N    RN   i  1, i  0, i  1, . . . , N .
i1

The purpose is the design of a full order stable
filter with the following state-space representation
x f (t)  A f x f (t) + B f y(t)
z f (t)  C f x f (t) + D f y(t),
nf

x(t)  A( )x(t) + B( )w(t)

and the transfer matrix from w to e is given by
1
H(s,  )  C( ) sI  A( )
B( ) + D( ), (4)

where s denotes the Laplace variable. Then, the
H robust filtering design problem can be viewed
as the minimization of a bound to the H norm
of the transfer matrix H(s,  ),   N .
Hence, this paper focuses on obtaining the filter matrices A f , B f , C f and D f by means of LMI
conditions with a scalar parameter such that an
upper bound for the H worst case norm of the
transfer function (4) is minimized, for all   N .
The H guaranteed-cost of system (3) can
be characterized by the so-called Bounded Real
Lemma (Boyd et al., 1994).

An alternative condition, including slack variables and a scalar parameter, to calculate a bound

the following lemma.

for all   N if there exist a parameter-dependent

parameter-dependent LMIs that can be solved
through LMI relaxations, providing bounds to the

As a result, by multiplying (11) by Z1T on
the left and by Z1 on the right, condition (6) is
obtained. Finally, since T T PT produces the lefthand side of (8) and, by a congruence argument,
one can conclude that P( )  0. Hence, the result
is proved invoking Lemma 2.

The matrices of the filter that ensures an H
performance for system (3) bounded by  can be
obtained by means of robust LMIs (for a fixed

Figure 1 shows the influence of the scalar  on obtaining an H guaranteed-cost and a robust filter
for this system. In this example, a search procedure in the scalar parameter yields a less conservative upper bound for the H guaranteed-cost
in the presence of uncertainty 57 smaller than
the one obtained with quadratic stability. Furthermore, defining E( )  E, G( )  G, J( )  J,
X4 ( )  X3T  J T , X1 ( )  E and X2  G, the condition of Theorem 1 provides the filter obtained
with the quadratic condition for sufficiently small
value of  , as expected.

Notice that, by definition, matrix P is partitioned similarly to matrix X. The condition
in (Geromel and de Oliveira, 2001) can be recovered by making   0+ in Theorem 1.

In other words, Lemma 3 assures that the condition of Theorem 1 always provides the H optimal filter in the case of precisely known systems.

The condition of Theorem 1 provides a competitive

using less variables (108 versus 168). In this example, for both Theorem 1 and (Lacerda et al., 2011)

obtained with the conditions in (Lacerda et al.,

For larger values of  , the method (Lacerda

Conclusions

A matrix inequality with a scalar parameter was
proposed to cope with the H robust filtering design problem for continuous-time uncertain systems. Comparisons with other well-known results in the literature have been made in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
method. The proposed condition becomes an LMI
for fixed values of the scalar parameter and contains the quadratic stability result as a particular case. Moreover, the robust filters designed
through the proposed approach provide competitive bounds for the worst case H norm when
compared to other results using less variables.
