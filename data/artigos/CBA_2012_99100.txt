Abstract
 This paper presents a procedure for modeling single-phase-interleaved-inverters whose legs are magnetically
coupled by means of the called Intercell transformers (ICTs). Additionally, a control strategy is proposed in order to improve the
current distribution among the inverter legs, which also mitigates the DC component of the circulating current. In order to
validate the proposed method, simulations and experimental results of a four leg interleaved inverter are presented.

Introduction

The advantages of using Intercell transformers (ICTs)
in interleaved converters and their design have been
studied extensively in the last years (Zumel, 2003,
2005 Costan, 2007 Meynard, 2010 Cougo, 2010,
2011). However, there is a lack of information when
the control of the converter is the study topic (Le
Bolloch, 2009). In fact, this is an important part of
the converter design given that the balanced current
distribution is not guaranteed due to disparities of the
inverter legs (Devancens, 1997) as a consequence of
this issue, the temperature of some components of the
circuit may rise beyond the expected andor a DC
component may circulate among the inverter legs
allowing the saturation of the ICT core (Le Bolloch,
2009).
The issues of a non balanced current distribution
were analyzed in (Le Bolloch, 2009), where the
authors also proposed a model and a control strategy
for a buck converter. However, the procedure shown
may not be directly applicable to PWM voltage
inverters with a low switching frequency. This is
because the control strategy used in (Le Bolloch,
2009) consists in a single controller for each current,
which disregards the fact that the converter with an
ICT presents a strong dependence between all the
converter states (mainly the leg currents). In other
words, the converter is a Multiple Input Multiple
Output (MIMO) system with strongly dependent
states, so the approach used in (Le Bolloch, 2009)
(design the controllers supposing that the system can
be approximated by a set of non interactive plants) is

useful only for frequencies where the coupling is low,
i.e. near zero. In this way, the control strategy used in
(Le Bolloch, 2009) is a useful and easy alternative for
controlling interleaved DC-DC converters, but its
application in voltage inverter is limited to those
cases in which the magnetic coupling between the
inverter legs is low enough.
Moreover, in (Bovolini, 2011) the coupling
between the inverter legs is taken in account in order
to control a three-phase three-leg inverter which is
done by controlling the difference between the
currents instead of each current. By doing this the
system states are decoupled, which allows the
controller design to be done with the classical SISO
(Single Input Single Output) control techniques.
However, this technique was designed to work with a
special modulation technique proposed in the same
paper, which is based in vector modulation and is not
applicable to single phase PWM inverters.
This paper presents an alternative control
strategy for balancing the currents of a single-phaseinterleaved-inverter with strong dependence among
the currents of the inverter. In this way, the first part
reviews some characteristics of the interleaved
inverter. The second part shows by means of an
example, a procedure that allows the modeling of the

inverter the third part shows a control strategy for
the balanced current distribution and the last part
shows the simulation and experimental results.
Finally, conclusions are given.
2 Interleaved inverters
The interleaved inverters are a topology of
parallelism. It is obtained by creating the PWM
signals of N inverters connected in parallel through
magnetic components (such as inductors, coupled
inductors or transformers) by using N different
carriers interleaved by 360N an example of the
connection is shown in Figure 1. This selection of the
PWM carriers reduces the output voltage distortion
and improves the dynamic behavior of the whole
inverter (Costan, 2007).
On the other hand, considering the measurement
and signal update procedures normally used in power
electronic applications, it turns out that the control
signals of the N inverters are not synchronously
updated. i.e., in order to avoid a variable delay in the
digital controller, the modulators are normally
updated one sampling period after its calculation
begins and only when the carrier (normally a
triangular one) of the respective inverter is in its
maximum orand minimum value. Furthermore, the
current measurements are also done in the same
instants since their mean value (calculated within a
switching period) can be obtained by just sampling
the currents in those instants.
The last considerations are shown in Figure 2 for
N4 and a switching period Tsw. Note that only the
sequences of the 1st and 2nd legs are shown this is
because in this case (by sampling at Tsw2) the 1st leg
is synchronized with the 3rd, and the 2nd leg with the
4th. In fact, when N is even, couples of control signals
are synchronized, while when N is odd, no leg is
synchronized with any other.
Depending on the magnetic components used in
the inverter, the aforementioned considerations could

represent a difficulty for the control design. For
example, if separated inductors are used, the
interaction among the inverters is given mainly by the
output voltage, so the control of the distribution of
the currents can be achieved by using a feed-forward
action of the output voltage and applying a SISO
(Single Input Single Output) control approach to each
inverter. So, the modeling of the non-synchronized
control updates is not strictly needed.
On the other hand, if coupled inductors are used
in the inverter, the interaction among the currents of
each of the paralleled inverters could be high this
precludes the use of SISO techniques for controlling
the currents. So, MIMO control techniques should be
used consequently it is necessary to obtain the
inverter model considering the asynchronous update
of the signals.
3 Inverter model
The continuous model of an inverter with N legs such
as the shown in Figure 1 can be easily obtained by
circuit analysis and can be written as

where I and 0 are the identity and null matrices L
and R are the inductance and resistance matrices of
the ICT.
The difficulty of obtaining the model arises when
the space state form is discretized because all the
control signals are not updated in the same instant, so
the classical discretization ZOH formula (Katsuhito,
1995) doesnt apply.
For the sake of simplicity, the procedure is
shown for N4. In this way, in order to obtain the
discrete model, the discretization equations are
recalculated taking as a time reference the sampling
instants of the 1st leg. So the other control signals are
modeled having delays of fractions of the sampling
period i.e., for N4 the time reference is equal to the
sampling instant of the 1st leg (which coincides in this
case with the 3rd leg) and the control signals of the 2nd
and 4th legs have a lag of half the sampling period Tsm
(which in turn is half the switching period). This is

more convenient form. This consists in separating the

that each vector contains only synchronized control

means of a standard state space representation. It is
important to note that the model shown does not
represent the delay inserted by the digital controller
so, in order to obtain the full model, it is necessary to
increase the size of the system with 4 additional
states (see the Appendix for more details).
3 Control strategy
The control topology used is shown in Figure 4 and is
based on the main idea of the controller proposed in
(Le Bolloch, 2009) which consists in avoiding the
control of the currents in the cascade multi-loop
topology and instead, it generates the current
reference signal as a function of the total output
current. So, the topology shown is simply an
improvement of the control strategy proposed in (Le
Bolloch, 2009) since here it is used a feedback matrix
obtained with the LQR technique (which is
applicable to MIMO systems) (Skogestad, 2005).
Additionally, the voltage control loop uses a PI

controller and a repetitive controller in order to
reduce the THD of the output voltage.
Even though the model obtained by means of the
proposed procedure is able to represent the nonsynchronized update of the control signals, it does
not take into account the non-synchronized
measurements. So, in order to solve this, a simple
procedure for estimating the non-synchronized
current measurements (i2 and i4 in this case) is used
and illustrated in Figure 5.
The procedure for estimating the nonsynchronized currents consists in calculating the
current i2 (and i4) as the mean value of the
measurement done half sampling period before and
half sampling period after the reference sampling
instant this is feasible since the delay of the digital
processor forces to wait at least half a switching
period (the chosen sampling time) to update the
control signal. So, instead of starting the calculation
of the next modulation value at the reference
sampling instant, the calculation is started half
sampling period after, when the measurement of i2
and i4 are available. This allows estimating their
values a half sampling period before, which means
that all the inverters measurements are available for
calculating the next control signal.
It is important to note that the calculation of the
output of the voltage loop controller (vctrl) can be
started in the reference sampling instant, so the next
half of the sampling period could be used for
calculating only the output of the current loop.

4 Simulation Results

interleaved inverter with 4 legs coupled with a
monolithic ICT was simulated. The components

As can be seen, there are some differences
between the model and the simulated circuit
however, they are relatively small and the dynamic of
the model is very similar to the dynamic of the
circuit. So, the model is good enough to allow the
design of the controllers.

As can be seen, the current distribution is better
than the obtained by simulations, however an
unbalance exists. In the other hand, the controller
improves the current distribution and the output
voltage THD as well. This is quantitatively shown in
Table 2, where the current distribution is examined
by means of the RMS value of each current i.e. the
RMS values of the currents of the legs are compared
with their expected value, which was calculated as
the mean value of the 4 currents. In this way, the line
Error in the table shows the percentage error of
each current with respect to the expected value, and
the line Total error shows the sum of the individual
errors. So, as can be seen, by using the controller the
currents distribution was in fact improved and the
output voltage THD reduced to accepted levels.

6 Conclusions
The procedure shown for the modeling and control of
an interleaved inverter is simple and able to improve
the current distribution while taking into account the
MIMO characteristic of the coupling introduced by
the ICT. Also, the difficulties that arise when
interleaving the PWM carriers were explained and
considered in the control design.
The results obtained show that besides an improved
distribution of the current, the controller reduced the
THD of the output voltage to less than the maximum
accepted value (8 for non-linear loads and 5 for
linear ones). In the other hand, even though the
current distribution was improved in the example
shown, an unbalance still persists however, the
method should be capable of reducing the unbalance
with larger gains in the feedback matrix, which would

And given that the applied voltages are constant
over some time intervals, the expression (2) can be
written as

xk + 1  e ATsm xk  + A 1 e ATsm  I B1  1

By defining v  (k+1)Tmst - , the first integral in
(3) not solved yet can be written as
(k +1  2 )Tsm

So, in order to write (7) in the standard space
state form, two states are defined as
v2l (k + 1)  v2 k 
v4l (k + 1)  v4 k

In this way, (7) becomes

 v k 
xk + 1  A d xk  + B1d  1

In a similar fashion, by means of the same
integration variable substitution, it is possible to
show that the second integral in (3) can be written as

Finally, in order to model the delay inserted by
the digital processor, the currents 4 control signals (v1
,v2 ,v3 and v4) are turned into states and 4 new control
signals (v1C ,v2C ,v3C and v4C) are defined as
vn k + 1  vnC k 

So, the model of the inverter that takes into
account the digital processor delay can be written as
