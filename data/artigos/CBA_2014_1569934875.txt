Abstract In this paper some relations that exist between expressions in Screw Theory of Robotics and
Differential Geometry, from the point of view of Cartan, are presented. The ideas were inspired in books of
Differential Geometry, Lie groups and Lie algebras and its applications. The Cartans connection is the initial
concept, followed by the covariant derivative. It is presented how kinematics and dynamics are obtained, in case
of pure rotations and general movement in Euclidean space. The generalization of these concepts to Riemannian
manifolds are then presented, and some conclusions are drawn concerning the possibility of kinematic chain
calculations in such space (propagation of velocities). Finally, the idea of using connections and covariant
derivatives are extended to multi-frame cases (as is common in Robotics) in Euclidean space.

a central concept in modern Particle Physics, as
it can represent eletromagnetic potential, gluons
(particles that carry the strong force) and many
others (Schwarz, 1996). In the case of Screw Theory, moving frames are fields of screws, and Cartans connections are fields of twists.
Connections are essential in the definition of
time derivatives in non-inertial moving frames (covariant derivative or total derivative), and by using covariant derivative, it is possible to rewrite
Newtons law and Eulers equation in a form that
is invariant in any non-inertial frame. This framework even predict that serious troubles must be
tackled in a possible generalization of Robotics to
the Riemannian case, as it is easy to prove (and
will be done in this work) that no reference frame
exists that can be used as base of a kinematic
chain (propagation of velocities and accelerations)

Introduction

Concepts of Differential Geometry and Lie Groups
and Algebras have been used in Robotics for a
long time, with the first appearing in classical references as (Craig, 1989), where transformation between two reference frames are matrices in the matrix group SE(3) (or SE(2), if the manipulators
movement is planar). More recently, Screw Theory, that was developed by (Ball, 1876), started to
be applied, but the modern definitions of screws,
twists and wrenches as elements of SE(3), se(3)
and se (3), (respectively, a Lie group, its Lie algebra and Lie co-algebra), are far more recent
(Sattinger and Weaver, 1986). Today, there are
very complete references on the subject (Murray
et al., 1994).
Cartans connections are geometrical objects
that are fundamental to modern Geometry and
Physics, besides the concept of moving frames
(Schwarz, 1996), (Choquet-Bruhat et al., 1989).
In simple terms, given a manifold M (that could
be Riemannian), a moving frame associates to
each point in M a reference frame (in general, noninertial), and a Cartans connection is a derivative
field of a moving frame that generalizes the concept of gradient. A common physical interpretation (in Mechanics) is that a Cartans connection generalizes the angular velocity of the moving frame (or of a moving rigid body) to a Riemannian manifold, and it contains geometric information, which is related to the curvature of

space E 3 that are representations of group SO(3)
and Lie algebra so(3) in the vector space E 3 . In
fact, kinematics and dynamics of points use representations in E 3 , but kinematics and dynamics of
rigid bodies uses the adjoint representation, that
are Lie groups and algebras representations in the
very Lie algebra (in this case so(3)), which is also
a vector space. Another important fact is the Lie
algebra isomorphism between so(3) and R3 , with
the Lie bracket A, B  AB  BA corresponding
to the vector product  of Analytic Geometry.
The action of so(3) in E 3 given by applying  in
r0 , (that is r0 ), is equivalent to the vector product   r0 , where there is a isomorphism between
vector  and matrix . The vector r0 is called relative velocity, and equation (2) shows the transformation formula from the non-inertial frame to
the inertial one for the velocities.
The matrix (t) contains the information of
how the (moving) frame S 0 moves, and in the book
(Sattinger and Weaver, 1986), it is said that it
is a (Cartans) connection, although the point of
view to be presented here are not developed there
(and, as said before, the body is fixed by a point).
Also, as the space is Euclidean, Cartans connection reduces to a Maurer-Cartan form restricted
to a curve R(t), that is a special kind of connection
(from the didactic point of view, the understanding of Maurer-Cartan is a preparation for understanding connections).
In order to further discuss Maurer-Cartan
(see, for example, (Ivey and Landsberg, 2003)), it
is important to remember the following given a
Lie group G, its Lie algebra g is the tangent space
in the identity element I  G, like presented in figure 1  a). Any tangent vector in G, represented
by a velocity  of a curve (t), can be translated
to the identity element I by a left multiplication
by . This mapping is called left translation, and
the formula    allows to represent any velocity  as elements of the Lie algebra g. It is
clear that it is the generalization, for an arbitrary
group, of the formula R  R in SO(3) (bodys
velocity) presented in the last section (all groups
share this property).

could not find in the specialized literature. Concepts and calculations will be presented to support
itens 1), 2) and 3), as well as references.
The point of departure of this work was the invariant Newton-Eulers formulation of rigid body
dynamics presented by (Sattinger and Weaver,
1986), section 14, pages 44-48, that is adapted
and presented in section 2. It treats the kinematics and dynamics of a non-inertial frame (that
could represent a rigid body) that only performs
rotations around a fixed point. The precise notion of connections and covariant derivative is presented, as well as its dynamics. In section 3, it
is presented the basic idea of the kinematic and
dynamic in SE(3), which describes the complete
movement of points and rigid bodies in the Euclidean three-dimensional space E 3 . The reader
will easily recognize Screw Theory concepts, but
it is a preparation for the next sections.
In section 4, it is presented important concepts of Riemannian spaces, that are useful to
generalize Robotics to Riemannian space, and it is
shown that the kinematics calculation are in trouble in this case, due to the space curvature (there
is no inertial reference frame). In section 5, after
the results obtained in the previous sections, it is
shown how to determine kinematics and dynamics of manipulators (several frames) in Euclidean
space (in the Cartans connections context), and
some formulas are proved (that are believed not to
be in the literature). Finally, in section 6, conclusions and directions of future works are presented.

Kinematics and Dynamics in SO(3)

Following the steps of the book (Sattinger and
Weaver, 1986), any point in the Euclidean space
E 3 is represented by a three dimensional vector r0
in a non-inertial frame S 0 , and by a vector r in
the inertial frame S. Both frames have the same
origin. The transformation matrix between the
two frames, that depends on time, is represented
by R  R(t), whose columns are the vectors of
S 0 expressed in the coordinates of S. R(t) could
be viewed as a trajectory in the Lie group SO(3).
The positions of an arbitrary point in E 3 are related by

In fact, if one applies Dt to r0 , it results in
r + r0 , which is the velocity of point r0 as seen
in the inertial frame, but in the coordinates of the
non-inertial frame S 0 .
Another time derivative applied in equation
(1) would produce the transformation formula for
accelerations, that involves several additional inertial accelerations, that corrects the Newtons law
for non-inertial systems. The result is very simple
to obtain, but the same could also be obtained by

Weaver, 1986). It is clear that those formulas are
related. Although it is tempting to divide both
sides of the last formula by dt, it is not mathematically rigorous. In the following, it is illustrated
the determination of a Maurer-Cartan form that
is mathematically rigorous.

group is the planar rotation and corresponds to

associates an number in the interval 0, 2) (that
is, an angle) to that point. If S 1 is the unitary circle in the complex plane, any point in S 1 (except

Dynamics of rigid body in SO(3)

In order to obtain the dynamics of the rigid body
motion, it is necessary to work in another representation of the Lie group SO(3) and Lie algebra
so(3), that is the adjoint representation in the very
Lie algebra so(3). In this new representation, the
covariant derivative must be defined by



0

which is the definition of (t).
In a certain sense, one could say that the (angular) velocity field () is transformed in a
hodograph by the Maurer-Cartan form (note that
it is unidimensional). Returning to the general
case of SO(3), it is possible to define

Definition 2.3 (Covariant Derivative)
Given a connection , the covariant derivative in
the adjoint representation is an operator that act
in elements of so(3) given by

etc. An essential concept in the dynamic formulation is the angular momentum, that is related
to the angular velocity by the a linear operator I,
that is called the inertial operator. In the book
(Sattinger and Weaver, 1986), it is shown how
to calculate it, by working in the second copy of
so(3), that we avoid here. The angular momentum is given by

the frame in relation to an inertial frame S (the
space frame). Again, the three vectors of S 0 are arranged as column vectors in an orthogonal matrix
R, that belongs to the Lie group SO(3) (in planar
movement, the group would be SO(2)). The origin of S 0 in relation to S is represented by a vector
  E 3 , that are arranged in a larger 4  4 matrix
of the form

and the Newtons law (or Eulers) is given by

which belongs to the Lie group SE(3). Another
point of view is important here, that was not used
yet. To each , that indicates a point in E 3 , it is
associated a copy of the Lie group SO(3) (let us
call it SO(3) ). The Lie group SE(3) can then be
identified with the space E 3  SO(3), which is of
course, another Lie group (every vector space is
a particular kind of Lie group, known as Abelian
Lie group). SE(3)  E 3  SO(3) is also a special
kind of differentiable manifold known as (principal) fiber bundle. A section of a (principal) fiber
bundle can be imagined as a field that associates
to each point in E 3 an element of SO(3), which
is a frame. Any smooth field of frames represents
possible rigid body motions in all directions. A
curve in SE(3), that is (t), describes the motion
of a rigid body (translational and rotational, see,
for example, (Ivey and Landsberg, 2003)).
As is done in Screw Theory (see for example (Selig, 2005)), the group actionrepresentation
of SE(3) in operators over E 3 represents, in the
active point of view, a translation and rotation
(screw movement) of a vector in E 3 and, in the
passive point of view, a coordinate transformation
from S 0 to S. If Lagrangean dynamic formulation
would be applied, SE(3) would be the configuration space for the rigid body motion. The space
E 3 is homogeneous in the sense that no point is
different of all the others (see (Kobayashi and Nomizu, 1969)). Every homogeneous space is the
module of a Lie group and one of its sub-groups.
In particular, E 3  SE(3)SO(3). The motion of
points are simply curves in E 3 .
If equation (1) is modified to include frame
translation, then equations (2) could be written
as r  RDt r0 + . In the group SE(3), this expression is written as

Dt   T
where T is the torque matrix acting in the rigid
body. After some substitution, we have

In the next section, the calculations presented
here (that came from (Sattinger and Weaver,

screws, twists and wrenches). Although the formulas are well known in Screw Theory, the author
could not find a similar formulation in the literature (using covariant derivative and connections).

Evidently, to describe acceleration of a point,
as well as its dynamics, the equations (5), (6) and

3.2

A twist   se(3) is related to a screw by the
exponential formula e (Murray et al., 1994).
Chasles theorem states that any rigid movement
is a screw. In a sufficiently small neighborhood of
I  SE(3), there is a one-to-one correspondence
between twists and screws, that is established
by the exponential functions of Lie groups (see
(Sattinger and Weaver, 1986)). If g(t)  SE(3) is
the motion of a rigid body in relation to an inertial
frame, 1 (t)(t)  se(3) is called the body velocity and 1 (t)(t)  se(3) the spatial velocity, and
they are related by the adjoint action of SE(3) in
se(3). The same ideas presented in subsection 2.2
apply in this case, which results in the dynamic
equations for rigid bodies. As generalized forces
are 1-forms in the configuration space (Bullo and
Lewis, 2005), cotangent vectors in SE(3) are generalized forces in a rigid body. Due to the MaurerCartan form (a particular type of connection), all
the generalized forces can be mapped, by right and

left translations, to the Lie co-algebra se(3) , and
those elements are called wrenches. A wrench F(t)
acting (as a co-vector) on the rigid body with twist
(t) (the vector) is the number hF, i(t), which is
the instantaneous work done by the wrench. In
section 5, a continuation o this section will be presented.

where (t) is the rotation matrix curve in so(3).

the curve (t) can be transformed to elements in

second, not abelian, representing rotations. It is

Kinematics in Riemannian Space

In this section, the Cartans connection will be
presented in its full generality (that is, it will not
be a Maurer-Cartan form anymore) as the space
where the bodies move, that is M , is Riemannian.
Also, an arbitrary number of moving frames (as
necessary in Robotics) will be assumed. In principle, none of them will be inertial, and it will be
shown that it represents a big difficulty for the
generalization of kinematic chains, that needs an
inertial frame of reference.
In fact, M is not a homogeneous space anymore, and cannot be given by module of two
groups. The space of all frames in all points is
no longer a group, but a principal fiber bundle P
with base M and canonical projection   P  M ,
with fibers isomorphic to SO(3), which is the symmetry group (Kobayashi and Nomizu, 1969), (Ivey
and Landsberg, 2003). The action of SO(3) in P
is fiber preserving, that is, only rotates a frame,

Anais do XX Congresso Brasileiro de Automática
Belo Horizonte, MG, 20 a 24 de Setembro de 2014

and not change its origin. The motion of a point
is a curve r(t) in M . A rigid body motion is a
curve (t)  P , and its projection (t)  ((t))
is the translational motion of the body. The principal fiber bundle has a symbolic notation, that is
(P, M, , SO(3)) (Kobayashi and Nomizu, 1969).
A moving frame in P is a section (field) that
attributes to each point x  M a reference frame
sx . This could be seen as application s  M  P
that satisfy   s  IdM (the identity application
in M ). A moving frame could also be seen as
a set of tangent vector fields xi , that are linearly independent in each point (the number of
vectors is the dimension of M ). Any other moving frame could then be written in terms of those
vectors, which results in a field of SO(3) matrices
X  M  P.
The concept of Cartans connection, in its full
generality, appears in the following way to a given
moving frame s, it is associated a 1-form field 
with values in so(3), that represents the frame angular velocity. It is formally defined as the Darbouxs derivative of the moving frame, and it is
calculated as s () (the pullback of  by s), where
 is the Maurer-Cartan form of SO(3) (Ivey and
Landsberg, 2003). In general

measures how much the structural equation is not
satisfied. For the rigid body motion, the angular velocity curve (t), that is calculated from the
connection similarly as done in the example, is
no longer a curve in g (in this case so(3)), but
has its values distributed along copies of so(3)
in each point of M . Hodographs are not defined in this cases (Kobayashi and Nomizu, 1969),
(Sharpe, 1997). Now, the transformation formulas between frames and Cartans connections are
deduced (see figure 2).

a Riemannian space M , a Cartans connection

Then, the formula in the theorem is a transformation between connections in different frames.

The Cartans connection is no longer a
Maurer-Cartan form of a group (as was in the
SE(3) case) but is related to such a form (in fact,
it appears in connections definition). In fact,
when a principal fiber bundle reduces to a Lie
group, a Cartans connection reduces to a MaurerCartan form (Sharpe, 1997). A natural question
to ask is what are the conditions for a smooth
field s  M  P be a field of frames ? The answer

Given a (Riemannian) space M and a connection
 with values in g, the associated covariant
derivative is given by

where I is the identity in g.

1-form  with values in g such as d +     0
( is the exterior product). Then, in each point
x  M , there is a neighborhood U and an application s  U  M  G such as s (G )  . Also,
given two such applications s1 , s2 , they must satisfy s1  as2 for some a  G.

results are important. Suppose there are three

In this final section, it will be shown, in the context of Screw Theory in Euclidean planar space,
how the various formulas in kinematic and dynamic chains can be deduced in the context of
Cartans connections (in this case, Maurer-Cartan
forms). To the best of the author knowledge, the
theorems and lemmas in this section, in the context of Cartans, are not in the literature.

According to (Spivak, 2005), if the space M
is flat (that is, the curvature 2-form  is null),
the principal fiber bundle can be reduced to a Lie
group, and it is possible to find a moving frame in
which the connection reduces to a Maurer-Cartan
form. In other words, its is possible to find a
frame, say S, in which the corresponding connection is   0. If such a connection exists, then its
is possible to find a frame where no inertial forces
are present, in other words, it is possible to find
an inertial reference frame. In other words, it says
that Robotics calculations (for example, the determination of angular velocities of links) would be
in trouble, as it is strongly based in the existence
of an spatial (inertial) reference frame. The study
of how to do such calculations will be subject of
future research.

The connection can be calculated for each
frame of sequence (kinematic chain) both in the
representation of SE(3) in E 3 and in the adjoint
representation (that is, the covariant derivative
similar to the one in equation (7)). It is then
possible to formulate rigid body dynamics in this
representation.

Conclusions

It was presented some concepts and results relating the Screw Theory (used in Robotics) to
concepts in Differential Geometry and Lie groups
and Algebras. In particular, it was shown that
Cartans connections (a differential geometric concept) is the natural generalization for angular velocities and twists for general Riemannian spaces.
It was also shown that Newton-Euler formulation
of Robotics are written in this context in an invariant form (by using connections) and more research
has to be done in order to generalize Robotics to
the Riemannian case (necessity to redefine kinematic and dynamic chains, as no inertial reference
frame is possible in general). To the best of the
authors knowledge, such an exposition is lacking
in the Robotics Literature, as well as some of the
formulas and theorems proofs.
In future works, the question of how to calculate angular velocities of robotic chains in Riemannian spaces, as well as questions related to the
dynamics of rigid bodies, will be investigated, as
well as possible practical applications of the results presented. Also, several other formulas and
theorems had to be excluded from this paper, due
to the lack of space in a conference paper, as well
as important practical matters like singular configurations. In a (near) future extended version of
this work, to be submitted to a journal, all those
questions will have their deserved places.
