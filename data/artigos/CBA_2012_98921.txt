Abstract The proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) are an efficient way to produce electrical and heat energy However, it
still demands researches to be economically competitive. Improvements of the PEMFC efficiency without shortening its lifetime are
required. Once the efficiency is a PEMFC output voltage function, it is proposed a theoretical methodology to adjust the
characteristic using a multi-variable semi-independent fuzzy controller system (FCS). The fuzzy inference system (FIS) uses meta-rules
as reference to control the output voltage. Simulations are presented to show that higher output voltage levels can be reached by using
desirable curve limits. Efficiency gains are increased up to 5.11 regarding the rated values.
Keywords PEMFC, efficiency, neuro-fuzzy algorithms, simulation, control.

1 Introduction
The PEMFC technology represent an attractive energy
source. In order to study it, evaluating its viability, and
checking its impact in a grid for better results, it is
necessary to obtain simulators and control models and
methods that consider several functioning aspects.
Commercially, they are sold in modules (HORIZON
FUEL CELL, 2010 BCS FUEL CELLS, 2009), with
power varying from a few kW to hundreds of MW,
covering a large application range, mainly for
distributed generation (DG).
The electrochemical phenomena of the PEMFCs are
sensible to variables with complex modeling. Among
these are the temperature and pressure, load demand,
manufacturing products quality, reactants purity and
catalyst action. To overcome these issues, this paper
uses Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems
(ANFIS) to simplify the modeling.
This paper proposes a control method that aims at the
performance management in steady-state regime to
maintain the efficiency inside predefined ranges,
repecting the generators physical limits. This controller
acts, simultaneously, over different magnitudes, such as
reactants pressure or flux (of
and
), or both,
temperature and, eventually, over the membrane
humidity. It is important to reach the highest output
power, limiting the
operational region. It is
assumed that the linear region is more suitable for the
PEMFC operation. It reduces potential damages to the
generator since the best efficiency levels are located
inside these limits. This paper starts from the hypothesis
that it is possible to adjust few parameters in order to
tune the efficiency inside the
linear region.

This work defines the operational conditions using a
multivariable platform that allow modifications in its
settings due to internal parameters that not have neither
a precise nor direct control. Considering the stand-alone
operation, if one of the grid primary sources is a
PEMFC-based generator, the controller acts to increase
the output power without reducing the efficiency.
Once classic control theory requires a very accurate
system model, it is used an algorithm based on fuzzy
logic. In this paper the PEMFC is treated as a blackbox system. The controller identifies current load
conditions and compensates the output parameters. The
efficiency level is the reference used by the controller.
It is used a NedStackTM 6 kW PS6 generator as
reference to the theoretical basis. All available results to
this generator are obtained with simulations.
This work is organized as follows section 2 introduces
the 6 kW PEMFC ANFIS model. Section 3 presents the
basics to develop the multivariable fuzzy algorithm that
manages the PEMFC performance. Section 4 shows
simulated results to demonstrate the proposed controller
and the main conclusions are discussed at section 5.
2 ANFIS modeling
Under certain theoretical conditions, the generators
response is considered more important than the precise
description of the internal processes. Therefore, in this
paper, the PEMFC is analyzed as a black-box,
independently of the mathematics of the internal
phenomena.
Tao, S. et al. (2005) studies the PEMFC characteristics
and uses the approaching and self-learning ANFIS
abilities to build a temperature-based model. It is the
reference to the control algorithm, setting the modeled

1282

parameters for an on-line compensation. The
temperature is critical to improve the efficiency and
lifetime. Higher temperature reduces the mass
transportation limitations increasing the reactions rates.
It affects the output maximum voltage due to
thermodynamic considerations, including the partial
pressure water vapor.
Zenith, F. and Skogestad, S. (2007) shows a
thermodynamic model based on the instantaneous
output, regarding to instantaneous current and voltage
outputs. They proposed a theorem to indicate specific
conditions where the output power can be controlled. It
is possible to change quickly the output power to its
maximum value in a load range condition. Such results
consider the current values of temperature, partial
pressures, catalyst poisoning and other parameters. This
theorem is valid for a defined set of values, which
determines the polarization curve.
Farret, F. A. et al. (2009) obtained a PEMFC model
replacing the usual equation set by the response of
electronic components. This model offers a
approximation for the transient behavior. However it
does not allow a deeper efficiency investigation.
A parametric model implemented in PSIMTM simulator
is presented by Farret, F. A. et al. (2009). The model
takes into account the PEMFC electrical equivalent
circuit and the equations are obtained through
Kirchoffs Laws. This is suitable to evaluate a power
interface connection, given its transient characteristic.
Though, it has constraints regarding to
curve study,
due to conception restrictions and portability.
Lee, W. et al. (2004) employs an Artificial Neural
Network (ANN) to obtain an empirical model that
includes processes variations without massive
computational requirements. The ANN is trained to
simulate a PEMFC using with
and air. The model
considers the current density, pressure changing,
temperature and humidity, covering important
impacting factors that determinate the PEMFC
performance. To prove the ANN model application, a
complete generator system , including the ancillary
systems, is simulated. Experiments to efficiency
improvements are not conduced as well as the power
interface effects under transient loads.
The ANN-based models can be treated as a nonparametric methodology to work with non-linear
characteristics. They have properties to process
identification and can support non-linear process
through information from acquired data supplied to the
net training. Therefore, it is possible to use an empirical
non-parametric model to estimate the electrochemical
characteristics, including processes variations, without
extensive calculation.
2.1 ANFIS PEMFC Model
The used database to create the model comes from the
Nedstack PS6 product data (2009). The PEMFC
parameters are used to generate an ANFIS model in

ISBN 978-85-8001-069-5

MatlabTM. It was created a database by changing the
variables about 20 from its rated values. That is, the
dataset consists in subsets where each variable is
modified while the others remains constant. Therefore,
a data vector consisting of 98 training pairs is created.
From the collected dataset, 84 pairs are used to test the
model. After that, a new database was generated to test
the PEMFC ANFIS. However, this database is build
using variations about 10 and 15 of the variables
rated values. The Table 1 shows the generated ANFIS
network.

The figuresFigure 1 toFigure 5 present simulation results
using the ANFIS model to the 6kW PEMFC. These
figures show that the model outputs are very similar to
the original values, used to the training. As it can be
seen, in Table 2, the errors are low, once the ANFIS is
trained with the same PEMFC data.

3 Fuzzy control system (FCS)
The PEMFC energy production is a function of external
and internal factors. The latter are comprised of
characteristics, such as, internal ducts geometry and
distribution, cells stacking, water membrane content
and so on. The reactants pressure (or flux) are
considered external factors, as the temperature, input air
humidity, among others.
Tekin, M. et al. (2004) uses fuzzy control for the energy
optimization. The air blower is controlled and it is

considered that it drains almost 40 of the total
produced energy. Two fuzzy controllers are proposed
for the blower and ancillary peripherals (pumps, fans
and valves). The controller responds to electrical
variations avoiding lifetime reduction. Besides the
energy optimization, maintaining correct stack
conditions, according to the load demands, it is not
considered the

Fuzzy logic is used to maintain the voltage in a defined
range during load variations by Zhijun, M. et al. (2005).
Load current, stack temperature, anode and cathode
pressures are input variables. An intelligent algorithm
manages the non-linear system. However, it does not
aim at a better efficiency regarding the fuel usage and
temperature maintenance.
Huang, S. et al. (2008) performs experimental studies
regarding to
supplying. Fuzzy and PID control
comparisons are made. Fuzzy algorithms present
efficiency gains about 37, rather than the 14.67 of
the PID, resulting in less
is waste. Also, fuzzy is
faster to estimate and test variables.
Bao, C. et al. (2006) proposes a dynamic model to
simulate the gaseous flows, humidity and pressure
effects. Multivariable controllers are designed to control
the air and
flow. This aims at a transient
performance taking into account the air stoichiometric
relation, anode and cathode pressures. It is observed
that the relationship between output voltage and water
transport is very sensitive in estimating the humidity
and purge operation. Multivariable controllers,
compared to PID, have greater disturb rejection.
The controller must consider the FC behavior during
transients, monitoring the power demand, efficiency
and load regulation. Load current increase causes
modifications in
characteristic, leading the
generator to a region where the diffusion losses are
greater and the efficiency is reduced.
Schumacher et al. (2004) uses fuzzy logic to water
management by controlling the air stoichiometry,
adjusting the membrane water content. A 10 increase
of the output power is reached, and greater levels are
obtained at higher temperatures. However, this study
focuses on membrane humidification and higher power
levels at the end of the
characteristic,and does not
evaluate the conditions in steady-state operation, nor the
problems where the diffusion losses are predominant.
The controller consists of the application of parallel and
decentralized fuzzy blocks acting over each variable in
a semi-independent way. The blocks intersection and
its feedback are the FC itself. It allows the temperature,
pressure and flux instantaneous values fitting (and
others, eventually). Figure 6 presents a schematic
simplification.
A block is a fuzzy rule set for each variable. The
blocks feedback is given by the
and
present
values. It is described, at first, a fuzzy rule set,
representing each variable behavior. Finally, the blocks
are associated under the format of a single functional
rule set. The integration block is the own PEMFC.
These steps are followed

This work uses the input variables fitting to maintain
the desired efficiency inside a pre-defined range. Such
fit is verified in the
curve, where the activation
losses are predominant at lower current levels.
Therefore, the output power is reduced. Where the
concentration losses are higher, the efficiency is too
low. So, the linear region is more interesting. It is
considered that the controller must increase the
efficiency in this region. The fuzzy meta-rule (SMITH,

As the first step, a FIS prototype algorithm is used to
develop the 9, 25 and 49 rules blocks. The results with
9 and 25 rules where tested apart (not showed here).
The best approachs are reached by using 49 rules. The
49 rules FIS offer a more precise tuning, compared to
the 9 and 25 rules FIS. The Figure 9Figure 10 and

4 Results
The
control results are presented in Figure 12. Its
variation has low influence over
(and so, in the
efficiency). For lower
values it is not possible to
reach higher load currents. The linear region ranges
from 40 to 150 A (roughly). The average efficiency
gain, is about 0.22. Holding the
value, at full
time, 20 above its rated value results in a gain of
0.38 on the electricity production. However, the
wasting is greater. In Figure 13, the output power can be
observed by using the
compensation.
The
control results are given in Figure 14 Figure 15, for
output voltage and power, respectively. The average
output voltage gain is 0.562. The controller effects
have the same considerations compared to the
control. Holding the
value, at full time, 20 above
its rated value, the generator produces a gain of 0.879.
In this case, it must be considered that the oxygenair
flows are supplied from a blower. So, without an air
flow control system, there will be an energy waste from
the blowers.

control were used to manage the temperature, the
available power would be of 6.25 kW. At the final
curve stage, the maximum output power is 7.8 kW (200
A39.3 V). It is possible to get up to 6.6 kW (at 140
A47 V) from the generator by holding the temperature
at, at least, 20 over its rated value. The PEMFC is
permanently heated in this case. However, the energy
waste through the heating system makes this option
disadvantageous.
The Figure 18 Figure 19 present the results for the FIS
integration and Figure 20 presents the gains summary,
regarding the rated values. These gains are calculated to
the linear region, where the controllers are tuned. It is
concluded that the multi-variable fuzzy controllers
allows obtaining higher efficiency levels, without using
the FC outside its linear region. Also, to this case, the
49 rules FIS are better to design the controllers. In
figure 19, the item maximum is the gain obtained by
keeping the controlled variable above its rated value.

It can be inferred that the hypothesis of increasing the
PEMFC efficiency within its linear region is valid. This
conclusion is supported by simulation results obtained.
Another consideration is that the efficiency can be fitted
around its nominal values acting on each control
variable on the integrated action.

1286

Another proven fact is that the application of FIS
control, as shown in Figures 6 and 7, allows the FC to
operate within a predefined area. Also, the control
structure presented in Figure 5 is used as reference for
modeling, enabling to define heuristically controllers to
be applied.

The proposed controllers have static and simplified
structures. Despite that the fuzzy logic provides a wider
range of alternatives, it is assumed that the form applied
here is sufficient to support the hypothesis.

Using an ANFIS model simplifies the design. However,
it requires two additional tasks the recognition
behavior of the generator to variations of magnitudes of
control (expert knowledge) and the acquisition of
meaningful data that enables the configuration, training
and testing the neural network that emulates the
generator. Moreover, since the variables collected
adequately represent the outputs behavior, one can use
more quantities in the model, allowing the precision of
the response. For example, it is possible to include the
humidity influence as an additional variable.

This paper presents neuro-fuzzy algorithms used to
model and control PEMFCs. It is observed that the
ANFIS
can
represent
the
characteristic
satisfactorily, with low error margin. Moreover, the
model can encompass many different parameters,
simply by training the neural network with the
generators behavioral information.
To obtain an optimization of the energy generating
plant, this paper proposes a based fuzzy logic strategy.
This choice is made to provide a systematic
methodology to develop an energy management
strategy based on rules and premises type IF ... THEN.
It is observed that in literature, in general, the proposed
controls aim primarily to maintain the operating
conditions. Therefore, these studies are not always
addressed to the benefits of maintaining optimized
PEMFC points in operation during the steady state
regime. This efficiency customization is the central
hypothesis of this work.
To build up the controller rules blocks, experimental
tests should be conducted. Despite the PEMFC can be
approximated in general, each case must be evaluated
for the construction of more adequate control. This is
due to the relevant characteristics to each generator,
such as the internal geometry of the channels and the
diameter pipelines supplying gas and air, cooling
system, among others. For this reason, it is emphasized
that the use of fuzzy algorithms is more suitable for this
application as it allows translating the observed

The hypotheses presented is validated with simulations,
which are applied in parallel fuzzy blocks to manage
the efficiency. As seen, for this case, 49 rules may
achieve gains above 5 over the theoretical PEMFC
rated values.
