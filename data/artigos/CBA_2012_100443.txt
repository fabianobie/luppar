Abstract In this paper is proposed a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) Fuzzy controller applied to the direct field oriented
control (DFOC) scheme. In the conventional field oriented control scheme, two PI controllers are used to generate
the reference stator voltage vector in the rotor flux rotating field reference frame. To reduce a quantity of
PI controllers present in conventional DFOC scheme, is proposed the T-S fuzzy controller to substitute both
PI controllers. The proposed controller calculates the reference quadrature components of the stator voltage
vector. The rule base for the proposed controller is defined in function of the stator current components errors.
In this controller is used the trapezoidal and triangular membership functions for fuzzification of the inputs.
Constant switching frequency and low torque ripple are obtained using space_vector modulation technique. The
performance of the proposed DFOC scheme with T-S fuzzy controller is analysed in terms of some performance
measurements such as rise time, settling time and torque ripple, considering different operating conditions. The
simulation results shown that the proposed scheme ensures fast torque response and low torque ripple, validating
the proposed scheme.

INTRODUCTION

The three-phase induction motors are widely used
in industrial application, because of their simple
and robust structure, higher torque-to-weight ratio, higher reliability and ability to operate in dangerous environment. However, because of the coupling between torque and flux, unlike dc motor,
their control is a challenging task. One of the
classical methods of induction motor control is the
field oriented control (Blaschke, 1972). It leads to
decoupling between the flux and torque, thus, resulting in improved dynamic response of torque
and speed.
In general the use of fuzzy systems does not
require the accurate mathematical model of the
process to be controlled. Instead, it uses the experience and knowledge of the involved professionals to construct its control rule base. The
fuzzy logic controller (FLC) to be investigated
is the Sugenos type (Takagi and Sugeno, 1985),

ISBN 978-85-8001-069-5

although there exist other types, for example,
the Mamdanis (Mamdani, 1974) and the Yamakawas (Yamakawa, 1987).
The fuzzy controllers has proved powerful in
the power electronics area and control of electric machines as shown in various articles in the
literature, e.g., in (Chitra and Prabhakar, 2006)
and (Heber et al., 1997) the fuzzy logic controller
(FLC) for the speed control is implemented using
the field oriented control technique as it provides
better control of motor with high dynamic performance. In (Hakju et al., 2001) also is proposed
and another fuzzy speed controller and is compared with a conventional PI controller, shown
that this controller takes superior performance under varying operating conditions, like step change
in speed and torque reference. Similarly, in (Badr
et al., 2010) is proposed the fuzzy speed controller,
but this controller is applied in indirect fieldoriented control scheme. This scheme was compared with two speed control techniques, scalar

control and conventional indirect field oriented
control, showing its superiority especially with
high dynamic disturbances.
In (Radwan et al., 2004) is proposed a FLC to
have less computational process to help in its realtime implementation, the FLC parameters were
tuned by genetic algorithm (GA) resulting in a
robust controller for high performance industrial
drive applications, and in (Douiri et al., 2012)
is also applied a genetic algorithms to optimize
the fuzzy speed controller design with indirect
FOC scheme besides, more controllers that works
with self-organizing self-tuning fuzzy logic controller, and a speed model reference adaptive_control are presented in (Ashrafzadeh et al., 1995)
and (Cerruto et al., 1997), respectively.
Unlike the schemes mentioned before, in this
paper is designed a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy
controller to substitute the both PI controllers
present in the conventional Direct Field Oriented
Control (DFOC) scheme. The T-S fuzzy controller calculates the quadrature components of
the stator voltage vector represented in the rotor
flux rotating field reference frame. The rule base
for the proposed controller is defined in function
of the stator current components errors. In this
controller is used the trapezoidal and triangular
membership functions for fuzzification of the inputs.
The direct component of the stator voltage is
represented as a linear combination of its inputs,
however, the quadrature component of the stator
voltage is similarly represented as a linear combination used in the first output but with the coefficients interchanged, not to be necessary another
different coefficients values for this output being
only necessary to adjust two parameters instead of
four parameters present in the two PI controllers.
The simulation results shown that the proposed
T-S fuzzy controller for the DFOC scheme have
a good performance in terms of rise time, settling
time and torque ripple when it was tested at different operating conditions, validating the proposed
scheme.
This paper is organized as follows. In section 2 the background of the dynamic equations
of the three-phase induction motor, and the field
oriented control principle are presented. In section 3 the topology of the proposed control scheme
is analysed and in section 4 the proposed T-S fuzzy
controller is described in details, mentioning different aspects of its design. Section 5 presents the
simulations results of T-S fuzzy controller, and in
the end, the conclusion is given in Section 6.

Field Oriented Control

In the rotor flux rotating field reference frame the

The equations (8) and (9) show that the component ids of the stator current can be used as
a control quantity for the rotor flux dr . If the
rotor flux can be kept constant with the help of

of a control variable for the torque te (Quang and

THE PROPOSED DIRECT FIELD
ORIENTED CONTROL SCHEME

The Figure 1 shows the block diagram of the
proposed direct field oriented control (DFOC)
scheme, this scheme only needs sense the DC link
voltage and the two phases of the stator currents
of the three-phase induction motor to calculate the
stator voltage and to estimate the rotor flux. In
the DFOC scheme the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy
controller utilize the direct component of the stator current error (Eids ) and the quadrature component of the stator current error (Eiqs ) as inputs, and the stator voltage quadrature components as outputs. These outputs are represented
in the rotor flux rotating field reference frame. Details about the T-S fuzzy controller are going to
be presented in the next section.
3.1

Stator Voltage Calculation

The stator voltage calculation utilize the DC link
voltage Vdc , and the inverter switch state (Sa , Sb ,
Sc ) of the three leg two level inverter. The stator
voltage vector us is determined as in (Bertoluzzo
et al., 2007),

Rotor Flux Estimation

To estimate the rotor flux firstly we need to estimate the stator flux. The stator flux estimation
depends of the stator voltage and the stator current space_vectors, it is

(11)

The problem in this type of estimation is when
in low speeds the back electromotive force (emf)
depends strongly of the stator resistance, to resolve this problem is used the current model to improve the flux estimation as in (Lascu et al., 2000).
The rotor flux represented in the rotor flux rotating field reference frame is

With the aim to correct the errors associated
with the pure integration and the stator resistance measurement, the voltage model is adapted
through the PI controller.

The Membership Functions (MFs) of the first order T-S fuzzy controller are shown in Figure 4 and
in Figure 5, for the direct and quadrature components of the stator current errors, respectively.
The universe of discourse for the input Eids is
defined in the closed interval -0.5, 0.5. The extreme MFs have trapezoidal shapes but the middle one takes triangular shape as is shown in Figure 4. However, the universe of discourse for the
input Eiqs is defined in the closed interval -10,
10 as is shown in Figure 5. The shapes of these
MFs are similar to the first input. For both inputs
the linguistic labels are N, Ze and P that means
Negative, Zero and Positive, respectively.

TAKAGI-SUGENO (T-S) FUZZY
CONTROLLER

The first order Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy controller
proposed in this paper takes as inputs the direct
component of the stator current error Eids and the
quadrature component of the stator current error
Eiqs , and as outputs the quadrature components
of the stator voltage vector, represented in the rotor flux rotating field reference frame. The first
output (uds ) is a linear combination of the inputs,
similarly, the second output (uqs ) takes the similar linear combination used in the first output but
with the coefficients interchanged how is shown in
the Figure 3.

when the consequent part of the rule is a real number we have the a zero-order controller, but If the
consequent is a linear combination we have a firstorder controller (Pedrycz and Gomide, 2007). The
rule base to calculate uds and uqs is shown in Table 1.

The simulations were performed using MATLAB
simulation package which include Simulink block
sets and fuzzy logic toolbox. The switching frequency of the three-phase two level inverter was
set to be 10kHz, the direct component of the stator current (ids ) was set to be 0.77 pu and the
coefficients considered in the T-S fuzzy controller
were a  5 and b  0.1.
In order to investigate the effectiveness of the
proposed control system and in order to check the
closed-loop stability of the complete system, we
performed several tests.
We used different dynamic operating conditions such as step change in the motor load (from
0 to 1.0 pu) at ninety percent of rated speed, noload sudden change in the speed reference (from
0.5 pu to -0.5 pu), and the application of an arbitrary load torque profile at ninety percent of rated
speed. The motor parameters are given in Table 2.
The Figure 6 shows the torque response of the
DFOC scheme with T-S fuzzy controller when the
step change in the motor load is apply. The electromagnetic torque tracked the reference torque
with the following performance measurements
rise time tr  3.5ms, settling time ts  5ms and
torque ripple is at about ripple  1.0. Also is
observed that the behavior of the stator current is
sinusoidal also in the Fig. 7 shows the circular behavior of the stator flux quadrature components
when this test was made, and in consequence the
proposed controller maintain the stator flux constant.
The Figure 8 presents the results when an
arbitrary torque profile is imposed to DTC-SVM
scheme with T-S fuzzy controller. In the first subfigure the angular speed takes about 0.5 seconds
to reach the speed reference, in the next one the
electromagnetic torque tracks the reference torque
as expected, and in the third sub-figure the si-
