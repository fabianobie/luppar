Common Lyapunov Functions

Among the most relevant open problems in control theory is the following given two autonomous
dynamical systems x  a(x) and x  b(x) with
a common globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point, nd a common Lyapunov function or show that none exists (see, for example, (Liberzon, 2003) and (Margaliot and Liberzon, 2006)). If such a function exists, any possible
switching between the vector elds a and b must
stabilize the system.
In its full generality as stated above the problem is likely to be algorithmically intractable
(Blondel et al., 2004). For some pairs of systems
the answer to the question above is likely to be I
dont know, even with the best algorithms. With
the goal of developing a method which will give
such an inconclusive answer less often, we write
a partial dierential equation whose solution is a
common Lyapunov function for two autonomous
dynamical systems. We call it the maximal Lyapunov partial dierential equation. After suitable
smooth convex approximations, the equation can
be studied using the Cauchy method of characteristics, which essentially reduces it to the initial
value problem for a system of ordinary dierential
equations. As a proof of concept, we plot the integral curves of the characteristic vector elds, obtained by numerical solution of the ordinary dierential equations. Many other geometric, analytic,
and numerical methods are also available to treat
partial dierential equations of the type obtained.
In Section 2, we discuss a partial dierential equation that can be used to build a Lya-

punov function for one given dynamical system,
or to show that none exists. In Section 3, the
maximal Lyapunov partial dierential equation,
which is a nonlinear rst order PDE to be used in
searching for common Lyapunov functions, is presented together with useful approximations. In
Section 4 we review the main concepts of the
Cauchy method of characteristics for quasi-linear
and nonlinear rst order partial dierential equations. In Section 5, the formulation of the Cauchy
problem for the maximal Lyapunov PDE as an
exterior dierential system (EDS) is presented.
This is the subject of a large literature, and we
do not pretend to give a full tutorial in such a
short space complete treatments can be found in
the references. In Section 6, numerical solutions
to the Cauchy problem are presented for examples
found in the literature, and used to plot approximate graphs of the Lyapunov functions. Finally
in Section 7 conclusions and future work are indicated.

Lyapunov Partial Dierential
Equations

In a recent contribution (Pait and Colon, 2006),
the authors proposed to use a partial dierential
equation (PDE) to investigate stability of dynamical systems. A Lyapunov function for a single
vector eld a in a state-space manifold (that is,
a curved state-space) X with a single equilibrium
point (EP) must have a negative denite derivative v along the vector eld. If   X  R is a positive denite function, a Lyapunov function can be

obtained by solving the linear rst order PDE
La v +   0

(1)

called the Lyapunov PDE in (Pait and Colon,
2006) and v > 0. The function  needs to respect
smoothness conditions at the equilibrium point
but is otherwise arbitrary. The symbol La v stands
for the Lie derivative (or directional derivative) of
v in the direction of a. Positivity of the solution
v to (1) everywhere except at the equilibrium is a
necessary and sucient condition for stability of
the vector eld a.
Solving (1) is a delicate matter and only in
particular cases an explicit (or analytical) closedform solution can be found, for example in the
case of linear time-invariant eld and quadratic
candidate Lyapunov functions. In this case we
only need to solve the Lyapunov matrix algebraic
equation. On the other hand, we can transform
(1) in a simpler problem, by means of the method
of Cauchy characteristics.
This method states that a single rst order
PDE can be transformed in a system of rst order
nonlinear ordinary dierential equations (ODE),
which seems simpler, at least to us, control engineers. We applied this method in (Pait and
Colon, 2006) to study (1) in the particular case of
linear time-invariant vector eld a, and a decoupling property arose out of the fact that the PDE
is linear, plus the -Killing property of a, and rendered the Cauchy characteristics equation soluble.
It is also noteworthy that the ordinary dierential
Lyapunov equation (and its particular case, the
well known steady-state algebraic Lyapunov equation) can be derived from (1) in this case. This
method of solution was called Lyapunov reverse
method by the authors.
In order to generalize (1) to nd common Lyapunov functions for two or more systems, a modication is needed. If v is a common Lyapunov function for a class of autonomous systems, v must
be positive denite for all systems of the class,
that is, the maximum value among vs directional
derivatives along each direction must be negative
everywhere. In particular, for two systems a necessary and sucient condition for v to be a common Lyapunov function is max(La v, Lb v) +   0.
This equation, the maximal Lyapunov PDE, is the
object of study of this paper.

In order to nd common a Lyapunov function for
two dynamical systems (both with only one equilibrium point in the origin) x  a(x) and x  b(x),
the following equation could be solved

and this formula will be used further on. This
approximation is convex and its value is always
larger than the maximum itself. So it may happen
that we will not be able to nd a common Lyapunov function for a given pair a and b, even if one
exists, but this problem could be reduced by raising k or choosing a dierent function . The larger
the parameter k, the less conservative the approximation. On the other hand, numerical problems
are more likely to appear, depending of course
on the type of numerical algorithm used, if the
functions involved have sharper corners and larger
derivatives. Such issues related to smooth, convex
approximations have been studied in the nonlinear
programming literature (Bertsekas, 1996). From
now on we assume that a xed value of k is chosen and omit the subscript denoting dependence
on the parameter.

only a system of ODE to be solved. We use  to

in order to avoid confusion.

The Method of Characteristics

In this section we give a brief introduction to the
method of characteristics to solve a nonlinear rst
order partial dierential equation. At rst reading, the reader may wish to skip to the equations
(8), which describe the characteristics, and to the
numerical results in the following two sections.
We are working in a coordinate-free setting,
so the best way to represent a PDE is by means
of k-jet spaces. The vector elds a, b are tangent
to the state-space X and the systems (switched)
trajectories are (at least continuous) curves in this
space. If necessary, a general set of coordinates in
this space could be x1 , , xn (or xi , for short).
The candidate Lyapunov functions v are functions of type v  X  R, that is, one dependent
coordinate and n independent coordinates. Their
graphs are n-submanifolds of J 0 (X , R)  X  R,
and this space is known as 0-jet space of X . The
partial derivatives i v are also functions of the
kind f  X  R, and we could construct the
space J 1 (X , R) with n independent coordinates
xi and n + 1 dependent coordinates, that is, v
and its n partial derivatives i v. So, given a
function f  X  R, there is a n-submanifold in
J 0 (X , R) (its graph) and another n-submanifold
S in J 1 (X , R), that to each point with coordinates x1 , , xn in X corresponds a point with
coordinates x1 , , xn , v(xi ), 1 v(xi ), , n v(xi ) in
J 1 (X , R). We could also construct the space
J 2 (X , R) by the same way (and by adding the
second order partial derivatives). Of course, J 1
contains J 0 , and J 2 contains J 1 , and so on.
For a single PDE
F (x1 , , xn , v, 1 v, , n v)  0
with smooth function F  J 1 (X , R)  R, the
n-submanifold S would be the set of points in
J 1 (X , R) that are mapped to zero. Another way
to represent this PDE would be by means of a distribution  (in the sense of (Isidori, 1995)) that
must be formed by the n-hyperplanes tangent to
S in J 1 (X , R) or by an exterior dierential system
(or EDS) I in this same space, formed by the differential forms that annihilates  (which include,
among others, the contact structure of J 1 (X , R),
that will be explained in the sequel).
As we are searching for the S n-submanifold
in J 1 (X , R), and its projection in J 0 (X , R), which
is the graph of the Lyapunov function v, we must
specify the values of v in an (n1)-dimensional initial manifold , in much the same way as we do in
initial-value problems or in boundary-value problems in PDE. In our case, on the other hand, the

ISBN 978-85-8001-069-5

problem we are going to solve is the Cauchy problem, and it consists in nding the n-dimensional
integral manifold S in J 1 (X , R) such that S contains  and is tangent to  (or annihilated by I)
in every point. When projected to J 0 (X , R), S
is the graph of a function v  X  R that is the
solution of the partial dierential equation.
The solution of a single rst order PDE can
be reduced to the solution of a system of ordinary
dierential equations, known as the Cauchy characteristic equations (see (Arnold, 1988)) and the
Cauchy characteristic vector eld c must be tangent to S in every point and also must be a symmetry of  (or I), that is, the ow of c must transform n-hyperplanes of  in other n-hyperplanes of
 (or, if it exists, tangent n-submanifolds of  in
other n-submanifolds of ). The integral curves of
c (the characteristic curves) have their images in
S, and when projected to J 0 (X , R), their images
must be contained in the graph of v. A bunch of
those curves can give us a good idea of the shape
of v, and we will plot some of those bunches in the
sequel.
We say that a point in  is characteristic if c in
this point is tangent to . In any neighborhood of
a non-characteristic point there exists a local solution S and it is unique (in neighborhoods containing characteristic points, no solution exists). This
is the Cauchy-Kowalewsky theorem, that guarantees that, unless the characteristic curves do not
cross each other, the solution can be extended indenitely. The vector eld c can be found without
solving any dierential equation, which is a great
advantage.
For the particular case of (1), that is a rstorder quasi-linear PDE. The vector eld c projected to J 0 (X , R) is simply (a, ), and it is tangent to the graph of v. For nonlinear single rst
order PDEs, c is not so easily determined, and
the fact of being a symmetry of  (or I) must be
used (we do it for the case at hand in Section 5).
First of all, we must choose a coordinate chart
in J 1 (X , R) and write the PDE as an equation
F (xi , v, pj )  0 (remember that xi are the n independent variables, v is the dependent variable
and pi are the rst order partial derivatives). The
EDS (that is, the system of dierential forms) I is
formed by the 1-forms dF  (F xi )dxi (we use
the Einstein summation convention here, where
ai bi  i ai bi ) and dv  pi dxi (the contact 1-form,
which is necessary in J 1 in order to have the pi
as partial derivatives). Having I, we can determine c by the symmetry property (see, for example, (Ivey and Landsberg, 2003)). The system of
ordinary dierential equations to be solved is then
z  c(z), where z  (xi , v, pi ).
Finally, one has to dene a Cauchy problem
in order to be a (common) Lyapunov function for
the dynamical systems a and b, the function v
must be a positive denite solution of equation

(3). One cannot choose the  as being the equilibrium point and pick v  0 in the equilibrium,
because a point is not a n  1 manifold. This
is not a technicality because the characteristics
are null at the equilibrium, solving such a Cauchy
problem is impractical. So let us consider an open
set D that contains the equilibrium, for example, a
small sphere containing the equilibrium point, and
take the boundary D as . Also, choose v  0 in
. This will later prove convenient when dening
boundary conditions to solve the equation numerically. We will study solutions outside . Initial
conditions to the p (partial derivatives) variables
must also be provided, we will use zero. If no solution that is positive outside D can be found, there
is no common Lyapunov function, otherwise, the
set D is stable, that is, all the switched trajectories of the pair a, b approach D (not necessarily
asymptotically). This is a kind of practical stability, which is sucient in the vast majority of
cases in engineering. The resulting v will be a
convenient approximation of the solution to the
original partial dierential equation we shall ignore its values inside the set D.

The Characteristics for the Common
Lyapunov Function Problem

Now that we know the PDE (and the Cauchy
problem) to be solved, and how to transform to
the system of ODE z  c(z), the next step is to obtain such a system. The advantage of transforming an PDE to an EDS system is explained in details in books such as (Ivey and Landsberg, 2003).
In essence, in doing so, we have at our disposal
all the tools of Cartans method (as well as other
dierential geometric tools).
The canonical contact 1-form for J 1 (X , R) is
dv  pi dxi

(4)

and the Lie (directional) derivative can be written
in J 1 (X , R) (in fact, in a coordinate chart of this
v
space), as La v  ai x
i , which render the PDE as
an algebraic equation of the form F (xi , pi , v)  0.
More specically, one has
pi ai + f (pi bi  pi ai ) +   0.

(the Einstein summation convention is also in
force here).

Equations (4) and (6) form the EDS to be

Cauchy characteristic vector c can be found by
the interior product of c with the 1-forms above
and the 2-forms given by the exterior dierentiation of the generators (see, for example (Ivey and
Landsberg, 2003)), which guarantees that c is a
symmetry of the EDS. More specically, given

(2n + 2)-dimensional space J 1 with coordinates
(t, xi , v, pi ), of which the n coordinates xi are the
independent variables.
In the sequel we will present solutions to
the initial-value problems for ordinary dierential
equations obtained using a standard commercial
numerical software.

Examples and Numerical Solutions

We will now investigate solutions to system (8)
in order to nd common Lyapunov functions. A
R
program in MATLABSimulink
was used for numerical integration. The integration was done
backwards in time, that is, for a vector eld opposite to (8), as c points in the direction of the
EP. The algorithm used was the ode45 (DormandPrince) with variable step and relative tolerance
1e  8, but could be another.
The two systems will be linear time-invariant
second-order with a unique equilibrium point (the
same point for both). If a common Lyapunov

The parameters  and  will be chosen in the
intervals 2, 0 and 5, 0 respectively. For
the region in the parameter space (, )  R2
near (2, 5), both the algorithms in (Shorten
et al., 2007) and (Deaecto, 2010) nd a common
Lyapunov function (respectively, a quadratic and
a maximal quadratic). For the region where both
parameters are closer to zero, neither algorithm
nds a solution (for more details, see Figure 2.2
in (Deaecto, 2010)).
In order to compare our method with the ones
above, initially we chose the values   2 and
  4 (for which both algorithms can nd common Lyapunov functions). Also,  was chosen to
be a circle of radius 0.001 and v  0 in this region, and the partial derivatives were chosen to be
both 0 in there. The system in (8) was then integrated with initial conditions in  and the others
being 0, 0, 0. The resulting characteristic curves
(that lives in J 1 (X , R), a ve dimensional space)
were then projected in J 0 (X , R) (that is three dimensional) and the resulting curves are plotted
in Figure 2. As we know, those curves must be
in the graph of a possible Lyapunov function v,
and clearly those have coordinate v > 0, which
indicates that there is a common Lyapunov functions of the switched linear systems with matrices
(9). More simulations would conrm that v > 0
is always greater that zero, which give us more
condence in the result.
Tests performed with dierent initial conditions (including dierent x1 , x2 nearer to the equilibrium point) have shown that the solution is not
sensitive to small variations. The projection of
this curves in the state-space results in Figure 3
and it is clear that the curves are going to the
innite. These curves are projections of the characteristic eld c, and not switched trajectories of
a or b.
The reader may wonder why the concentration of curves are higher in some regions. In fact,
it depends on the chosen initial conditions in  for

function exists, its partial derivatives are numerically close to zero near the equilibrium. So, the
initial values for p1 and p2 are taken to be zero.
At least, the numerical solutions guarantee practical stability of the switched trajectories at a small
region around the origin (a circumference of radius 0.001). The function  was chosen to be
0.01(x21 +x22 ) and the value adopted for the parameter k (for the approximation for max) was 100.
Those parameters could be chosen otherwise.
The local chart in J 1 (X , R) has coordinates
x1 , x2 (for the state-space), v for the independent
variable and p1 , p2 for the bers. We will study
an example from (Deaecto, 2010) and (Shorten

does not represent a problem at all. We are only
interested in the bowl shape (that is v > 0) described by those curves.
For the parameter values   0.5 and  
4, the methods in (Deaecto, 2010) and (Shorten
et al., 2007) do not provide common Lyapunov
functions, but ours does. It is clear that a common Lyapunov function for this case exists (see
Figure-4) and the projection of those curves onto
the state-space is shown in Figure 5. This common Lyapunov function is not quadratic (not even
maximal quadratic). If it were, it would be possible to nd it using the methods in the references
above. It is clear that a non-quadratic Lyapunov
function exists for this switched system.
In order to test our method, we simulated this
last system with dierent switching signals in or-

nd any such trajectory (in Figure 6 one can see a
sample of stable switched trajectories). Of course,
it is not feasible to check our method by exhaustive simulation.
None of the three methods provides a common
Lyapunov function when   0.4 and   1.5.
In Figure 7, we present an attempt to integrate
the characteristic equations (as done in the previous examples) but we do not obtain a common
Lyapunov function. It is interesting to see that
all trajectories start near (0, 0, 0) and v is increasingly positive, not unlike in Figures 2 and 4, but
then they reverse direction and v becomes negative. The characteristics are then attracted to the
origin, indicating that the solutions to the Cauchy
problem are not common Lyapunov functions.
Indeed unstable switched trajectories are easy
to nd. Figure 8 shows an unstable trajectory
obtained by switching among the two subsystems.
The initial conditions are (0.001, 0.001) and so the

trajectory is pointing outside.

Comments and Conclusion

We wrote down a nonlinear PDE whose solution,
when it exists, provides a common Lyapunov function for two dynamical switched systems (Cauchy
problem). We reduced such an equation to a
system of rst order ODE (as prescribed by the
Cauchy method of characteristics) and solved the
associated initial value problem by (at least to us,
control engineers) well known numerical methods.
Of course, we obtained only sets of curves (that
we know belong to common Lyapunov functions
graphs) and those curves only (strongly) suggest
the existence of the common Lyapunov functions.
We do not have yet a way to nd an explicit (analytic) expression for a common Lyapunov function
for a pair of switched systems a, b.
We should bear in mind that Im many cases
an explicit expression for a common Lyapunov
function does not exist, which does not mean that
no common Lyapunov function exists. We believe
that it is one of the simplest ways to describe
such a function, and solving such a PDE is the
right way to follow. The numerical simulations
described allow us gather information of the existence of common Lyapunov function for the pair
of vector elds a and b, which are not restricted
to be linear time-invariant. At present we do not
know any other systematical way to approach the
problem for such a wide class of switched systems. Also, our method conrms the results in
(Deaecto, 2010) and (Shorten et al., 2007).
Another useful point is that the whole theory
of partial dierential equations can be bought on
board, including the geometric approach in (Ivey
and Landsberg, 2003), and the functional analytic
method in (Evans, 2000). The method can be extended to nding common Lyapunov functions for
sets of n vector elds without undue increase in
algorithmic complexity. The only signicant step
is to write a PDE analogous to (3), whose solution
(if one can be found) is a common Lyapunov function for vector elds a ,   1, 2, . . . , m. This
can be accomplished by using the approximation

where v is the Laplacian operator and  > 0 is
small but nite. Despite of being an elliptic second order quasi-linear PDE, its solutions (called
viscous solutions) converge, in a certain sense, to
the solutions of (2), and there is an abundance of
results for (11) that could be useful for characterize the solutions on (2), that is, the common
Lyapunov functions. In particular, we hope that
those PDE help to nd a criteria to decide if a
common Lyapunov functions exists for a pair a, b
based in algebraic calculations using those elds
(for example, the several Lie brackets).
The case when the vector elds do not have
the exact same equilibrium is more delicate analytically, because a strict common Lyapunov function cannot exist. Nevertheless, we have reason
to believe that the techniques described here will
prove useful in constructing quasi-Lyapunov functions to study practical stability, or convergence
to an equilibrium set.
Although the choice of  in (3) is in principle somewhat arbitrary, and does not impact the
existence of a Lyapunov function, there may be
practical reasons to choose this function in a certain form. For example, with linear systems it is
natural to pick a quadratic , suggesting that the
choice is related to the underlying geometry of the
state-space. The function  is a design parameter
and motivation for its choice has to come from the
feasibility of analytic solution or from engineering
design consideration. Some of these issues have
been discussed in (Pait and Colon, 2006) and (Pait
and Colon, 2010).

a convex approximation to the maximum function
that is well-known in the nonlinear programming
literature (Bertsekas, 1996) (in fact, this approximation reduces to the one here in the case of two
functions). The computation of the characteristics and analysis of the partial dierential equation would proceed essentially unchanged.
Unlike the numerical algorithms such as those
based on sum of squares or linear matrix inequalities, we need not make any a priori assumptions
on the parametrization of the Lyapunov functions
nor on the class of systems under consideration.
The search is not restricted to functions that can

be expressed as a sum of squares, as a piecewise
quadratic function, or as a truncated converging
series.
We are currently investigating a generalization of equation (2) of the form
