Abstract This work addresses the evaluation of dual quaternion based controllers at the A2 Arm from Meka
Robotics robotic manipulator  a anthropomorphic manipulator with seven degrees of freedom. The efficiency,
compactness, and lack of singularity of the representation render the unit dual quaternion a suitable framework
for simultaneously describing the attitude and the position of the end effector. Motivated by the advantages of
this kinematic description and by the challenge of controlling a compliant robot with higher precision, a taskspace linear-quadratic optimal tracking controller (LQR) is tested in order to find an optimal trajectory for the
end effector, providing a tool to balance more conveniently the end effector error and its task-space velocity.
The proposed LQR allows further control of the trade-off between lower errors and a higher control effort at
task-space. The LQR is compared with a proportional controller with and without a feed-forward term and with
a decoupled proportional controller.

Resumo O presente artigo analisa o uso de controladores baseados em quaternios_duais no braco manipulador antropomorfico A2 Arm da Meka Robotics. A eficiencia, simplicidade e ausencia de singularidades na
representacao fazem dos quaternios_duais unitarios uma ferramenta adequada para descrever simultaneamente
orientacao e posicao do efetuador do robo. Motivados pelas vantagens desse modelo de descricao cinematica e
pelo desafio de controlar robos_complacentes com maior precisao, foi testado um controlador regulador_quadratico_linear (RQL) rastreador de trajetoria projetado no espaco de tarefas com o objetivo de obter uma trajetoria
otima para o efetuador e ter um modo de balancear o erro de trajetoria e as velocidades do efetuador. O RQL
proposto permite um equilbrio entre velocidades mais altas e menor erro, mas com maior esforco_de_controle.
Comparamos o RQL com um controlador proporcional com e sem termo de antecipacao e com um controlador
proporcional desacoplado.

Introduction

Planning and control techniques for robot manipulators are closely influenced by the robot type
and task particularities. Stiff robotic manipulators are able to accomplish tasks at relatively low
velocities and accelerations with the use of kinematic control strategies. Nonetheless, compliant
robots designed to work with humans have lower
stiffness and require new control strategies. The
present study evaluate the use of a optimizationbased kinematic controller at task-space for the
anthropomorphic Meka Robotics A2 Arm (Figure 1) compliant manipulator. The optimal controller is compared with decoupled proportional
gain feedback controller, and with dual quaternion
based proportional controller with and without a
feed-forward term.
The specification of robot tasks and the actuation take place in different spaces, the first occurs
in the task-space and the later in the joint-space.
This discrepancy turns difficult to use joint space
control techniques since joint space descriptions
must be retrieved from the robot task specifications Khatib, 1995. In other words, joint-space
control techniques demmand an external inverse
kinematics (IK) solution to find the joint variables
in terms of the end effector position and orienta-

tion. Nonetheless, there may or may not be a
solution for the IK and there may even be an infinite number of solutions. Since modern manipulator robots are often equipped with low level
controllers at joint level, task-space control techniques can be applied directly at the end effector
 making direct use of the available low level controllers instead of redesigning them.

Another important point to consider is a
proper representation for the task-space. The
homogeneous transformation matrix (HTM) describe both rotation and translation simultaneously and is commonly used in the mathematical development of robotics textbooks W. Spong

et al., 2005, Siciliano et al., 2009, Dombre and
Khalil, 2007. The HTM is described in matrix
form and usually requires a proper parametrization which makes the control design harder. In
addition, HTM are computationally demanding
and make use of 12 free parameters. The use
of dual quaternions over HTM handles coupled
and singularity problems with less computational
cost, represent all rotations with lesser parameters and eliminates the problem of singularities
that is inherent to the use of minimal rotation
representations Adorno, 2011. In the light of
those benefits, there has been an increasing interest in works related to the design of kinematic
controllers in dual quaternion space. Those works
comprise rigid motion stabilization and tracking
Wang and Yu, 2013, robust control Figueredo
et al., 2013, multiple rigid body coordination
Wang et al., 2012, multiple arm manipulation
Figueredo et al., 2014, and human-robot interaction Adorno et al., 2014.
The aforementioned control strategies and
mathematical tools were previously investigated
within a Matlab simulation environment using the
Kuka LBR iiwa 7 R800 industrial robot. However,
experimentation with real robots is still needed.
In this sense, this work evaluates control techniques on the A2 Arm. The motivation of using an
anthropomorphic compliant arm lies in their increasing use in the context of collaborative robots,
human-robot interaction (HRI) and the need of
testing existing control techniques within these
scenarios.

Preliminaries

To present the notation used in this work we recall dual quaternions and their basic algebra when
representing rigid_transformations and then do a
brief review of existing work in the kinematic control of robotic manipulators.
2.1

Dual Quaternions

Dual quaternion are dual numbers in which the
primary and dual parts are quaternions. A general
quaternion is composed by a real element and the
quaternionic units ,  and k such that 2  2 
k 2  k  1 and is described by h  h1 +
h2 + h3 + kh4 . Its conjugate is defined as h ,
h1  h2
  h3   h4 k. The norm of a quaternion is
khk  hh .
The rotation of an angle  around an axis
n  nx  + ny  + nz k can be described by the unit
quaternion r  cos( 2 ) + n sin( 2 ) where krk  1.
A translation t  tx  + ty  + tz k can be combined
with a rotation r to represent a unit dual quaternion rigid body motion as h  r + 21  tr in which
 is nilpotent dual unit i.e., 2  0, but  6 0.

ISSN 2525-8311

Furthermore, the unit dual quaternion conjugate
is h , r + 21 (tr) .
A general dual quaternion is composed of
eight elements g  g1 + g2  + g3  + g4 k +  (g5 +
g6 +g7 +g8 k). The vec operator is used to map it
into an eight-dimensional column vector i.e., g ,
g1 , g2 , g3 , g4 , g5 , g6 , g7 , g8 T . We also define the
matrix C8 , diag (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
such that
(1)
vec h C 8 vec h.
Finally, given dual quaternions g1 , g2 , the
+

Hamilton operators H(.),H(.) are transformation
matrices satisfying the following relation Adorno,
2011


+

vec (g1 g2 )  H(g1 )vec g2  H(g2 )vec g1 .

(2)

The set of dual quaternions H  D forms
a group under dual quaternion multiplication
Adorno, 2011. Quaternions and dual quaternions are associative and distributive, but noncommutative. The Hamilton operators are used
as a way to describe the multiplication operation of the dual quaternion algebra using matrix
form which allows to commute the terms Adorno,
2011.
2.2

Kinematic Modeling  Error Definition

The forward kinematics model (FKM) of a serial
manipulator robot (that is, the mapping between
the n-dimensional vector of joint positions   Rn
and the end effector pose h) can be obtained directly in dual quaternion space using algebraic
manipulations Adorno, 2011. In addition, the
differential FKM (i.e., the mapping between the
joint velocities   R. n and the generalized end effector velocity vec h  R8 ) is given by
vec h  J ,

(3)

where J  R8n is the manipulator Jacobian
(which is also found algebraically Adorno, 2011
and depends on robot joints configuration).
Since the spatial distance in dual quaternion
space is described by he  h hd , then the invariant error function is given by Figueredo et al.,
2013
e  1  h hd
(4)
Considering a time-varying reference hd 
hd (t), then the derivative of (4) is given by

e  h hd  h hd .

Dual Quaternion Kinematic Control

This section describes the characteristics of classic controllers and their application in the context
of trajectory tracking for manipulators and also
presents a recent dual quaternion based optimal
controller derived in Marinho et al., 2015.

3.1

Proportional Controller

Since the manipulator differential kinematics (3)
is a simple linear mapping, it is common practice to design closed-loop controllers based on the
pseudoinverse of the Jacobian J . Proportional
controllers can exponentially reduce the error between the current pose h and a desired pose hd .
Applying a least square minimization to

To obtain an exponentially stable closed loop
system, we define the following dual quaternion based proportional controller with the feedforward term,

Hence, e  ke where k defines the convergence rate.

(6)

where K is a positive definite matrix and J  is the
pseudoinverse of J. Although this control law can
be easily derived, we must remember that when
representing rigid motions using the dual quaternion, the reverse motion operation in unit dual
quaternion space is not given by a subtraction, but
by the multiplication by the conjugate. Hence, the
error is calculated in the invariant error form as
in (4). By rewriting (6) to use (4) and defining
N , H(hd )C 8 J ,

we obtain the result of Figueredo et al., 2013 of
the dual quaternion based proportional controller

The arbitrary gain matrix K in (8) controls the
rate of convergence. It is shown in W. Spong
et al., 2005 and in Figueredo et al., 2013 that
(8) converges for K > 0 and that it is stable.
3.2

Proportional Controller with Feed-forward
Term

The proportional controller yields an easy to implement and efficient solution for setpoint control.
Still, it neglects the influence of a moving reference. To better address the context of an end
effector tracking a desired trajectory instead of a
fixed point, we add a feed-forward term (K+FF)
to the proportional controller (8). Applying the
vec operator to (5), we obtain




e  vec (h hd )  vec (h hd )
Using (1)-(3) and (7) we obtain


e  H(hd )vec h  vec (h hd )
 H(hd )C 8 J   vec (h hd )
 N   vec (h hd ).

Linear Quadratic Optimal Control (LQR)

In Marinho et al., 2015, the optimal statefeedback is derived and its computation is discussed. It is shown that the kinematic control
with a time-varying reference can be described as
a linear time-varying system with an additive perturbation term. Instead of considering  the input signal for the system, we can consider as input the end effector velocity u using the mapping
u  N . This allows the optimization to be
done in task-space variables. Consequently, there
are the advantages of not requiring an external IK
solution and of making direct use of the available
robot low level controller instead of redesigning
them.
The LQR exploits future knowledge of the desired trajectory, therefore, it calculates the control
signals offline for a given desired trajectory. With
time varying h and hd , the error derivative is given
by (5). Hence,
e  1  h hd
 ehd  hd  h
 h  hd  ehd .

(10)

Using the vec operator on both sides of (5) and
applying (10) to (5) yields
e  H(hd )C 8 vec h + H(hd hd )e  vec (hd h).
(11)
By defining A , H(hd hd ) and c , vec (hd h),
using (3) and (7), we find
e  H(hd )C 8 J  + Ae + c

(12)

e  Ae  N  + c.

(13)

Hence, we aim at finding the optimal controller for the affine time-varying system
e(t)  A(t)e(t) + u(t) + c(t)

(14)

where u(t)  N (t).
Therefore, from the error point-of-view, it is
possible to solve the tracking problem for a continuous trajectory using a finite horizon LQR applied
to a disturbed system, as the error disturbance
caused by the time-varying trajectory is given by
c(t). Other modeled continuous disturbances can
also be grouped into c(t) and used in the same
solution.

given the matrices S, Q(t)  0 and R(t) > 0 with
S, Q, R  R88 . The matrix S is the weight of
the final error norm, the time-varying matrix Q
weighs the error cost along the trajectory, and the
time-varying matrix R weighs the control effort
in terms of end effector velocity norm. As long as
N is well conditioned, an increase in R will also
cause an overall decrease in joint velocities. The
optimization of (15) leads to an optimal feedback
without excessive expenditure of control energy

As c , vec (hh) is also known for all t and, with
the solution of P (t), we can find (t) by also solving it backwards in time. Applying as joint velocities we obtain the dual quaternion LQR based

Experiments Evaluation  Discussion

In order to show the controllers behavior under
different set of parameters, two different tasks on
the A2 Arm manipulator were devised. We choose
a circle and a square trajectory. The controllers
were implemented using the DQ robotics1 in C++
and using ROS2 to establish communication with
the robot.
The robot needs to accomplish repetitive
tasks while working alongside humans. Therefore,
we check the ability of the robot to follow simple
trajectories. Due to anthropomorphic arm joint
limitations we considered initial robot configurations which allows the robot to execute the whole
trajectory.
The circle chosen has 10 cm radius and is
drawn on the XZ-plane while maintaining Y constant. The robot initial configuration is given

ISSN 2525-8311

by 0  0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0. The second trajectory is a square on the XZ-plane with
10 cm side with Y constant and initial configuration given by 0  0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0.
They are independent trajectories and will be run
separately.
In order to simplify the LQR choice of parameters, we define s, q, r  R such that
S sI,Q  qI, R rI,
where I  R is an identity matrix.
The choice of parameters is closely related
with the task optimization goals. For instance,
we suppose that the end-time error is not of higher
importance than the error in the remainder of the
trajectory by setting s  0. The choice of q is
done in order to keep the system stable during
the whole trajectory and is closely related with r.
Because the r parameter weighs the control effort
in terms of end effector velocity norm, for a higher
r, the joint velocities will be lower and we need to
compensate with a higher q, that is a stronger
error correction demanding faster correction, in
order to obtain an acceptable minimization overall. The controllers described in (8) and (9) make
use only of the proportional gain k  R such that
K kI and I  R88 . The choice of k was done
by trial and error elevating the k value until there
would be no more improvement in the integral
norm of the error without an excessive increase
in the joint control effort.
For the K controller and the K+FF controller
we run each trajectory five times and get the median value for each attribute. The circular trajectory was also executed with a decoupled proportional controller which regards rotation and translation of the robot end effector separately.
In order to compare performance, we distinguish the LQR controllers by choosing a increasing weight for the control effort parameter, that
is r  0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1. Table 1 shows the results
for the circular and squared trajectory, where Err.
is the integral norm of the error,  is the integral
norm of the control signal, Ef f. is the integral
norm of the control effort, and L.V el. and L.Acc.
are the end effector velocity and acceleration integral norms, respectively.
In all controllers, the choice of q allows a wellbehaved initial motion. The effect in decreasing r
as shown in Table 1 yields a higher control effort and a slight increase in r results in a smaller
control effort. Meanwhile, the K and K+FF controllers have higher control signals and it cannot
be directly adjusted by specific parameters. Both
are bounded to the overall effect of the proportional gain k.
The behavior of the integral error norm when
using the LQR controller can also be seen in Figure 2. It shows the importance of adapting q for
each r considering the desired goal. When q is

selected in accordance with r, it is possible to reduce control effort and get a lower error due to
the q influence on error weight. The result of the
squared trajectory seen in Table 1 gives an example of that.
Although the LQR did not have the lowest
error norms, it did deliver in general the lowest
end effector velocities and accelerations for a lower
r (Table 1). The control effort is reduced with a
higher r as expected when q is correctly chosen.
This is graphically depicted in figures 3 and 4 for
the circular and squared trajectory, respectively.
The control signal  and the joints control effort
norm at the beginning of the trajectory (near t 
0) are lower for the LQR. If r and q are reduced,
the LQR controller yields a higher control signal
and therefore higher joints control effort (Figures
3 and 5), but tend to lower the error as seen in
Table 1 for the circular trajectory.
The Figure 3 shows that the LQR yields the
lowest values and peaks as desired. In the light of
using a real robot, the joint control effort yielded

order to prevent damage to the robot actuators.
Joint velocities commanded by the controller are
much greater than the angular velocities achieved
by the robot joints (control effort) as seen in Figures 3 and 4 and in Table 1.
Lastly, the results of the circular trajectory
contain the decoupled proportional controller.
They show not only higher error, control effort and
velocities as seen in Table 1, but can also lead the
robot to singular configurations which may damage the actuators and joints.

Conclusion

In this paper, we evaluated trajectory control
techniques in the task-space using dual quaternion based controllers and also a finite-time linearquadratic optimal tracking controller (LQR). The
optimization technique allows the designer to set
optimal gains for a given trajectory in terms of
control effort and error regulation. We provided
experimental results using the A2 Arm from Meka
Robotics 7 DOF compliant robot manipulator to
illustrate the performance and effectiveness of the
optimal criterion in comparison with a proportional gain controller and a proportional gain controller with a feed-forward term. Moreover, to illustrate the importance of a coupled  orientation and translation  representation and control
criterion, we also compared the dual quaternion
based controllers with a decoupled proportional
controller.
