Abstract This paper presents the design of an adaptive_control law that guarantees stability for a tracked
mobile robot under unknown longitudinal slip condition. The kinematic model of the mobile robot is derived
considering the slip as an unknown parameter. A control law that actuates on the angular velocities of the robot
wheels is designed such that the robot follows a given reference trajectory. An update rule is used to estimate in
real time the unknown slip parameter. The asymptotic stability of the global closed-loop system is ensured using
an appropriate Lyapunov function. Numerical results show the usefulness of the proposed control strategy.

larger ground contact patch, which is able to provide better stability and traction at various terrain
conditions (Nourbakhsh and Siegwart, 2004).
Most control design techniques for mobile
robots are based on the assumption that the
wheels roll without slipping. However, the slip has
a critical influence on the performance of mobile
robots that cannot be neglected. Thus, to attain
higher performance, it is necessary to incorporate
the slip parameters into the model of the robot.
Many researches have addressed the slip phenomenon in the navigation of mobile robots
(Matyukhin, 2007 Wang and Low, 2008 Sidek
and Sarkar, 2008). However, in such works, the
slip parameters are considered as disturbance or
noise (Scaglia et al., 2009) or are estimated using
some filtering technique (Zhou et al., 2007). Here,
we propose an adaptive rule based in Fukao et al.
(2000) to estimate the slip parameter.
In our paper, feedback velocity control inputs
are designed, according to Gu and Hu (2006), for
the kinematic steering system to enforce the position error converges to zero. Then, an update
rule is designed such that the estimated slip parameter converge to the true slip parameter of the
tracked robot. The update rule is derived using
a Lyapunov function that guarantees the stability
of the close-loop system.
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, a kinematic model of a tracked mobile
robot is derived, where the longitudinal slip is
modeled by a unknown parameter. In section 3,
an adaptive tracking controller is designed for the
kinematic model and the stability of the proposed

Introduction

In recent years, the interest in mobile robots has
grown significantly because of the great variety of
applications in unstructured environments, where
a high degree of autonomy is required. These applications usually require the robot to travel across
off-road environments in tasks as forestry, mining,
agriculture, army, etc (Gonzalez et al., 2009). All
of these tasks require an efficient solution to the
robot navigation problem, which has received increasing attention due to its theoretical challenges.
One of the main navigation problem, the
problem of tracking a reference trajectory, consists in designing control inputs that stabilize the
mobile robot in a given reference trajectory. In
general, this is a difficult problem, since mobile
robots are typical examples of systems that has
nonholonomic constraints (Kolmanovsky and McClamroch, 1995). According to Josephs and Huston (2002), if a system has constraint equations
that involve velocities, accelerations, or derivatives of system coordinates, the constraint equations are said to be nonholonomic, or kinematic,
and the mechanical system is said to be a nonholonomic system.
Many researchers investigate various tracking
control designs (Dierks and Jagannathan, 2009
Lee et al., 2009 Michalek et al., 2009). Tracking control design for wheeled and for tracked mobile robots can be respectively found in Morin and
Samson (2008) and in Fan et al. (1995). Although
the kinematics model of the tracked robot are similar to the wheeled one, the former has a much

This section derives the kinematic model of a
tracked robot with longitudinal slip. The slip is
described by a unknown parameter, under the assumption that the robot will operate at low velocities. The lateral slip is zero for straight line motions, and it can be neglected when the vehicles
turns on the spot or at low velocities. Figure 1
shows a model of the tracked mobile robot.

the tracked vehicle in the inertial Cartesian frame

Substituting (3) in (1), we arrive to the following model

To describe the motion of the robot, its is necessary to define a fixed reference frame F1 (xw , yw )
and a moving frame F2 (xm , ym ) attached to the
robot body with origin at its geometric center Om .
The motion of the robot is composed of the translation velocity x in the xm -axis direction and the
rotational velocity ddt with  the yaw angle.
Furthermore, the motion of the vehicle is constrained in the ym -axis direction with y  0 (nonholonomic constraint).
The longitudinal slip ratio of the two wheels
is defined as follows

Adaptive Tracking Control

In this section, we consider the tracking control
problem for the kinematic model (1) of tracked
mobile robots with the slip given by the parameter
i. The design is divided in three steps as follows
first, the tracking control law is found neglecting

the slip next, an update rule is designed to estimate the slip parameter and finally, closed-loop
stability is shown using an appropriate Lyapunov
function.
In order to deal with the tracking control
problem, we need to define the reference trajectory. The trajectory reference qr  (Xr , Yr , r )T ,
in the fixed frame F1 , is generated using the kinematic model
qr  S(qr )r

Now, if the slip parameter a that appear in (3)
is unknown, we cannot choose directly the auxiliary control input as given by (8). Hence, we design an update rule to attain the control objective
using estimate for a. Since a is not known, we use
formula (3) considering now the estimate a  a+a
with a is the estimation error

that is

To derive the update rule, it is necessary to
calculate (7) that depends on the auxiliary control input (2) which in turns depends on the new
effective control input (9). Thus, the derivative of
the error e is given by

with r  vr r T containing the desired linear vr and angular r constant reference velocities. Note that the signals vr and r can not be
simultaneously zero, otherwise, the reference trajectory qr does not exist. The signal r in (5) is
constructed to produce the desired motion. It is
assumed that the signals r and r are bounded.
This is not a severe restriction, since most practical reference trajectories satisfy this assumption.
The goal of the proposed methodology is to
design an adaptive tracking controller for the
tracked mobile robot with slipping such that

To obtain the update rule, we consider the following Lyapunov function candidate
V  V0 +

where q is the robot configuration given by (1) and
qr is the reference trajectory given by (5).
To investigate the closed-loop stability, we define the error e  (e1 , e2 , e3 )T in the frame F1 as

with v and  given by (8), the equation (12) for
V take the form
V  V0  k1 e21 

Neglecting the slip, Gu and Hu (2006) showed
that the control input

It is now possible to guarantee closed-loop stability by showing that e  0 is an asymptotically
stable equilibrium. Let the domain D be given
by D  e  R3    < e3 < , then the
Lyapunov function given in (11) is positive definite in D  0 with derivative V  0 in D.
This implies that e1 , e2 and the estimate parameter a are bounded. Since the reference velocity
r  (vr , r )T is bounded, we known from (8)
that the auxiliary control input  is also bounded.
Thus, e is bounded by (7). After all, V (e, e) given
by

with ki > 0 drives the error signals e to zero using

is also bounded.
Since V is a nonincreasing function that converges to some constant value. Barbalats Lemma
(Li and Slotine, 1991 Khalil, 2001) shows that
V  0 as t  . Thus, from (14), we know that
e1 and e3 tend to zero as t  .
It now remains to show that e2 also converges
to zero. Since we have already shown that all
variables are bounded, closed-loop stability can
be asserted by linearizing around the origin the
 T which contains the
augmented system p  e a
error equation (10) and the update law (13). Note
that a  a since a is constant. Thus, the linearized
model is given by

The data for the mobile robot used in this
section, taken from Zhou et al. (2007), are b 
0.65 m and r  0.35 m. The control parameters
for the controller are chosen as k1  6, k2  8 and
k3  6. The parameter for the adaptive rule is
chosen as   10. The initial conditions are taken
as qr (0)  (0, 0, 0)T and a(0)  1. Two reference
trajectories are used. First, a linear trajectory
generated with vr  0.5 ms and r  0 rads.
Second, a circular trajectory generated with vr 
0.5 ms and r  0.25 rads. The robot initial
conditions for the linear and circular trajectory
are respectively given by q(0)  (0, 1, 6)T and
q(0)  (0, 1, 4)T . To demonstrate the tracking
performance, the unknown slip parameter changes
from i  0 to i  0.25 at t  30 s and from
i  0.25 to i  0 at t  60 s.
Figures 2 and 3 show the tracking error e in
the fixed frame F1 for the linear and circular references trajectories, respectively.

Ap have negative real parts. Thus, the equilibrium
p  0 of the augmented system is asymptotically
stable and consequently the system error e and
the estimation error a converge to zero as t  .
