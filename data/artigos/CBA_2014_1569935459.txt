Abstract The tracking control design problem for a nonlinear ball_and_beam system is addressed. In this paper, the flatness
property of the system is here exploited for design a state feedback control scheme aiming to stabilize the systems trajectory
tracking error with respect to off-line planned trajectories. Differentially flat nonlinear_systems can be written in the Brunovsky
canonical form, which allows to perform the state estimation using the Kalman filter. In order to validate the performance of the
proposed tracking control, numerical simulations and experimental results are presented and discussed.

Introduction

first proposed and developed in (Fliess et al., 1992).
This property allows a complete parametrization of
all systems variables (states, inputs, outputs) in terms
of a finite set of independent variables, called the
flat outputs, and a finite number of their time derivatives (Sira-Ramírez and Agrawal, 2004).
Indeed, many physical systems are known to be
differentially flat, as can be seen in (Murray et al.,
1995). These systems can be directly linearize to a
controllable linear system in Brunovskys canonical
form by endogenous transformation. This feature allows to trivialize the trajectory planning tasks, without
solving differential equations, while simplifying the
feedback controller design problem to that of a set of
decoupled linear time invariant systems (Sira-Ramírez
and Agrawal, 2004).
The power of flatness is precisely that it does not
convert nonlinear_systems into linear ones. When a
system is flat, it is an indication that the nonlinear
structure of the system is well characterized and one
can exploit that structure in designing control algorithms for motion planning, trajectory generation, and
stabilization (Martin et al., 2012).
In (Rouchon et al., 1992), it was presented that
a ball_and_beam system used in (Hauser et al., 1992)
is non-differentially flat system, but a high frequency
control and averaging approach is proposed to approximate the system by means of a flat system. In (SiraRamírez, 2000), an approximate flat system is obtained by disregarding the centripetal force of the ball.
The flatness property allowed to compute a suitable
off-line trajectory planning and designed an incremental time-varying linear feedback controller.
Using differential flatness theory, this paper pro-

Control of underactuated systems, which is defined as the one with fewer controls inputs than degrees of freedom, is currently an active research field
due to its theoretical challenges and their broad application in Robotics, Aerospace Vehicles, and Marine
Vehicles (Olfati-Saber, 2001). The motivation for the
study of controllers for this systems is due the fact it
allows us to reduce weight and cost as well as consider situations in which component failures can occur (Reyhanoglu, 1996).
Belonging to the class of underactuated systems,
the ball_and_beam system is one of the most popular
and important benchmarks system for studying nonlinear control design. This system is widely used because of its simplicity to understand as a system and
provides the opportunity to analyze the control techniques (Amjad et al., 2010).
Many classical and modern control methods have
been proposed to solve both stabilization and tracking
problems for the ball_and_beam system. In (Hauser
et al., 1992), an approximate feedback linearization is
proposed to resolve the fact the relative degree of the
ball_and_beam system is not well defined. A Linear
Quadratic Regulator (LQR) was developed in (Rahmat
and Wahab, 2000) as an optimal control strategy considering the voltage of the motor as the input of the
system. In (Chang et al., 2012), a tracking control
strategy is designed using a pair of decoupled fuzzy
sliding-mode controllers.
Besides these techniques, tracking control approaches based on differential flatness have grown
substantially in recent years. Flatness property was

respectively. Furthermore, R is the radius of the ball, g
is the acceleration due to gravity, rarm is the distance
between screw and motor gear. The system input is
given by the voltage of the motor Vm .

poses a different control approach for trajectory tracking of the flat nonlinear ball_and_beam system presented in (Sira-Ramírez, 2000). Transforming the
nonlinear system to the Brunovskys canonical form,
one can design a feedback control law based on
the flat output ensuring convergence of the tracking error to zero. In addition, following the results
in (Rigatos, 2012), state estimation of the flat output
and its time derivatives is performed by applying the
standard Kalman Filter recursion to the equivalent linear system.
The paper is organized as follows. The mathematical model describing the dynamics of a nonlinear
ball_and_beam model is introduced in Section 2. In
Section 3, a brief mathematical description of differentially flat systems is given. The flatness property of
the system is used to determine the nominal trajectories for all system variables. Then, the steps to derive
the tracking controller is presented. Section 4 contains
the state estimation procedure for the associated linearized system by applying Kalman Filter. The performance of the proposed controller is evaluated through
numerical simulations and experimental tests in Section 5. The conclusions and suggestions for further
research are presented in the last section.

Differentially flat system is a system whose integral curves (curves that satisfy the system equations)
can be mapped in a one-to-one way to ordinary curves
(which need not satisfy any differential equation) in a
suitable space, whose dimension is equal to the number of input vector (Lévine, 2010).
More precisely, the flatness condition reduce to
find a set of specific variables such that all states and
inputs can be parametrize from these outputs and their
derivatives without integration. If a nonlinear system
x  f (x, u) has states x  Rn , and inputs u  Rm ,
then the system is said to be differentially flat, if there
exists a flat outputs z  Rm such that

Off-line Trajectory Planning

Equation (4) implies that, if we want to construct
a trajectory whose x(0) and u(0) are known, one
can find the initial and final values of the flat outputs and their time derivatives by the surjectivity of
(, ). Thus, it suffices then to construct a trajectory
t 7 z(t) at least n + 1 times differentiable that satisfies these initial and final conditions since x(t) and
u(t) are obtained by (5) and (6) (Lévine, 2010).
Knowing the system (2) is found to be differentially flat with flat output represented by the ball position x1 , the differential parametrization associated

Then, initially, assume that the state vector xT can
be measured. If the nominal trajectories for the x1
and its time derivatives are known, we can denote by
e  x1  x1 (t) the tracking error. An endogenous dynamic feedback can be computed for the system (15)

where    x1 and the gains ki being chosen such
that the polynomial p(s)  s4 +k4 s3 +k3 s2 +k2 s+k1
are Hurwitz polynomials. The tracking error e converges to 0, which implies convergence of the flat output and all its time derivatives to their respective nominal trajectories. Thus, from (5) and (6), we conclude
that the x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 and Vm locally exponentially
converge to their reference.
From (11), the final expression therefore for
Vm (t) is given by replacing (17) in (10).

All state variables usually cannot be measured in
many control applications, therefore, state estimators
can be a practical or economical alternative solution.
For linear systems subject to Gaussian measurement
or process noise, the Kalman Filter (KF) provides an
efficient computational (recursive) solution for state
estimation using a predictive-corrective structure. Figure 2 illustrates a classic discrete-time Kalman Filter.

As immediate consequence of the differential
parametrization, the system (2) can be transformed in
the Brunovskys canonical form (Rigatos, 2012)

It means that system (2) is equivalent to a fourth
order chain of integrators with the state vector xT containing the flat output and its time derivatives.
Thus, the linear system (11) can be written in
state-space representation

where the matrices Q and R correspond to the process and measurement noise covariance matrices, respectively. For further details, refer to (Bishop and
Welch, 2001).
For nonlinear_systems such as ball_and_beam system, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is commonly
used for obtaining estimates of the state vector through
the fusion of observed measurements. Although EKF
is efficient in several sensorless control, it is characterized by cumulative errors due to the local linearization assumption, and this may affect the accuracy of
the state estimation or even risk the stability of the
observer-based control loop (Rigatos, 2012).

where the second trajectory starts at 0.1 m and ends
at 0.1 m after 50 seconds. For each trajectory, the corresponding nominal trajectories for x2 (t), x3 (t), x4 (t)
and Vm (t) were directly computed by (7-10).
From (Quanser, 2008), the ball_and_beam parameters were Lbeam  0.4255 m, rarm  0.0254 m,
R  0.0127 m, g  9.81 ms2 , m  0.064 kg,

In (Rigatos, 2012), it is proposed a derivative-free
KF based on the differential flatness theory. For nonlinear flat systems, state estimation of the flat output
and its time derivatives is performed by applying the
standard Kalman Filter recursion to the equivalent linear model in Brunovskys canonical form without the
need for calculation of Jacobian matrices. In contrast
to EKF, this method improves the accuracy of state
estimation for nonlinear system avoiding linearization
approximations.
Based on that, for the ball_and_beam system, it
allowed us to estimate the state vector xT of the linear system (15), which is used to compute the tracking
controller described by the schematic shown in (17).
The control design using KF therefore can be summarized in Figure 3.

The ball velocity and beam angular velocity are

sampling period Ts  0.001s, the discrete-model of
the system (15) can be represented as follows

Simulation and Experimental Results

The experimental apparatus is a Quanser ball and
beam as can be seen in Figure 4. The beam consists
of a metal beam with a built in potentiometer sensor
that detects the ball role along the beam and its position, whereas an encoder is used to measure the beam
angle. By applying a torque at the end of the beam,
an DC servomotor drives the beam to a desired angle.
Furthermore, input saturation was added to the system.

Figures (5-6) and (8-9) depicts the ball position

inputs is shown in Figure 7 and Figure 10.
Both simulations show the ball_and_beam system perfectly following the trajectories specified previously, thereby ensuring that the tracking errors converging to zero as expected. Then, it allows us to validate the tracking controller in the Quanser ball and
beam.

As it can be seen, the proposed controller has a
good performance for all three cases. The main control design issue is choosing appropriate values for the
gains of the closed-loop controller, since it was realized that the state estimation is directly influenced by
their values.

presented as differentially flat. This property immediately allows to establish the equivalence of the model,
by means of dynamic state feedback, a controllable

linear system in Brunovskys canonical form. Precomputing the necessary off-line trajectory, the approach
is based on showing a systematic feedback controller
design to converge trajectory tracking error to zero exponentially.
Unlike other estimation methods, it was shown
that Kalman Filter can be apply in nonlinear flat
systems avoiding linearization approximations, which
improves the accuracy of estimation of the system
state variables. Numerical simulations and experimental tests illustrates the validity of the designed motion
planning and tracking control scheme for different trajectories.
In further studies, we expect to propose a flatnessbased controller design for the ball_and_beam system assuming the influence of centrifugal force term,
which implies that the system is no longer flat. However, a new approach based on the concept of flat inputs could be used to redesign the input vector field of
the system such that the given output becomes the flat
output, and allows to use the method discussed here.
