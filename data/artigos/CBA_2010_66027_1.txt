Abstract This paper presents a single-phase full-bridge voltage source inverter (VSI) with selectable sinusoidal output voltage. This inverter should be applied to loads that need alternating voltages with features of 60Hz, total_harmonic_distortion
(THD) lower than 5, and some of the root-mean-square (RMS) voltage values, such as, 110, 115, 120, 127, 220 and 230 Vac
(the indicated voltages are adopted in the Brazilian territory). The control strategy is based on the voltage mode control implemented with proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, and several references of signal voltages taxed into a PIC microcontroller. According to required output voltage of the inverter, the reference voltage signal of the feedback loop is selected using
two push buttons. In this paper is presented the analysis and design example of the power and control circuit for the extreme operation condition (output voltage of 110Vac and 230Vac). Finally, is presented the experimental results of the system for 300VA
apparent output power.

This paper presents a single-phase full-bridge
inverter, with unipolar PWM modulation and a large
output voltage range operation. This inverter has the
ability to feed loads with voltage levels equivalent
the levels adopted in the Brazilian territory, i.e., this
system presents sinusoidal output voltage with RMS
values of 110, 115, 120, 127, 220 and 230 Vac. The
selection of the output voltage is made by the user
through a friendly interface. The Fig.1 shows the
complete system diagram (Power and control) implemented.

1 Introduction
The power inverter is the most crucial component to many dc to ac conversion equipment. Due its
possibility to operate with a large range of power,
input voltage and output voltage, this equipment has
wide application such as

The mains characteristics of an inverter is its
possibility to provide clean and stable alternate voltage regardless of a type of load connected to it and
its ability to recover from transients caused by external disturbances as quickly as possible (Ayob, 2008).
In designing of linear model control theory, e.g. PI
and PID controller, the small signal linear approximations has been applied successfully to the nonlinear system. This approach enables the designer to
use a simple linear controller to keep the system
stable (Samosir, 2009). On the other hand, linear
controller presents good performance only near of
the specified operation point. Since the inverters are
non-linear time-variant systems, so, the controllers
design must have capability to cover up the non-

2.2 Output Filter Design

For the studied inverter was used unipolar PWM
modulation. This modulation has the advantage for to
present the harmonic spectrum frequency on the
input voltage of the filter equivalent the double of the
switching frequency, so, the filter presents reduced
size and weight. The prototype specifications are

By (14), it is observed, the inverter is a secondorder system and its parameters are input voltage,

varies with different output voltage operations of the
inverter. Fig. 2 shows the frequency response dia-

The transfer function of the inverter is shown in
(14). According to the control theory, for static converters, the controller cutoff frequency must be at
least one quarter of the switching frequency. For this
project is adopted a frequency of crossing with value
of one sixth of switching frequency, therefore it is
possible to set the gain of the controller. The poles
and zeros allocation of the controller is performed
according to the following criteria

Figure 2. Frequency response of the system without controller (a)
Gain, (b) Phase.

The inverter must present satisfactory operation
in the area bounded by these two curves. From Fig.
2(a) it can be seen that the cutoff frequency of the
system is the same for the entire operating range of
the system and it has the value of 30kHz. The difference between these two curves is only in the resonant
frequency associated with the low-pass filter of the
inverter. It is observed, the system presents higher
gain near the resonant frequency when it operates
with higher output voltage. It is desirable that the
system presents a low gain near the resonant frequency, so the controller design must be performed
using the higher output voltage of the inverter, thus it
is guaranteed that the system presents gain-frequency
response more satisfactory for all operation case.
From Fig. 2(b), it is observed that the system
presents more or equal phase lag when it operates
with higher output voltage comparing with lower
output voltage operation, so the system should
presents lower phase margin for higher output voltage and higher phase margin for lower output voltage. According to the control theory, for static converter the phase margin should be among 45 and
90, then the controller design must be performed
using the higher output voltage of the inverter, because this operation mode should presents a phase
margin outside of the indicated range. Therefore,
following these criteria, it is concluded that the controller design should be performed taking into consideration the worst case, output voltage of 230V and
higher load resistance.





The zeros are allocated on the natural frequency of the filter, given by (10).
The first pole is allocated at origin to minimize the static error on the steady state.
The second pole is allocated at a frequency
ten times higher than natural frequency of
the filter.

From these parameters is plotted the frequency
response of the controlled system.

3.2 Controller Design and Analysis of the Controlled
System

system (a) Gain, (b) Phase.

To control the inverter output voltage is used a
PID controller, implemented analogically. The Fig. 3

As expected, the system does not present significant difference between its operation modes. For the
different operation mode, the gain of the system
presents only a small difference near to the resonant
frequency. The system presents also the same frequency of crossing for both operations cases and the
value of this frequency is consistent with the required
for the controller design. Moreover, we can be seen
that the system has a phase margin of 47.5 and 49.2
when the inverter operates with output voltage of
110V and 230V respectively. Therefore, it is concluded that the system should provide fast response
to transients.

4.3 Proposed Solution
Comparing these two ways to change the output
voltage of the inverter, it is concluded that the second
mode is easier because the problem is solved by
software. Thus, it was implemented a software with 5
table corresponding to 5 sinusoidal reference waveform (each table is corresponding to one output voltage). The selection of the output voltage is made by
2 push button. The first one is responsible to increase
the output voltage and the second one is responsible
to decrease the output voltage. The Fig. 6 shows the
flowchart of the implemented algorithm.

4 Output Voltage Selection
There is two ways to change the output voltage
of the inverter. The first one is to modify the sampling circuit gain and the second one is to modify the
magnitude of sinusoidal reference waveform. These
both possible solutions are shown in this section.

5 Experimental Results
In order to verify the operation and evaluate the
performance of the studied inverter, a laboratory
prototype was implemented and tested. The prototype was tested with linear and non-linear load where
was applied to it step voltage and step load and was
observed the output voltage and output current. The
components used to assemble the prototype are listed
in Table 2.

4.2 Reference waveform
In this project, the sinusoidal reference waveform is generated by a microcontroller associate with
a DA converter. In the microcontroller software was
implemented a table with 250 values corresponding
to sinusoidal waveform. All element of the table
correspond to a sinusoidal period. The algorithm
passes through all element of the table using the table
index and every element is selected to be the output
of the microcontroller, forming a sinusoidal waveform.

The power inverter presented low THD for all
operation range independently of the characteristic of
the connected load and lower THD when it operates
with lower output voltage, due the lower index modulation. This inverter presented also fast transients
response and lower current and voltage variation in
