Introduction
2.

The permanent magnet synchronous machines
are employed in numerous industrial applications
(MILLER e HENDERSOT JR, 1994) and recently in
electric_vehicles, where these machines appear as the
best suitable machine for this application (CHAU,
2008). Also, these machines should be employed as
AC generator.
As known, the air-gap flux distribution is highly
influenced by the permanent_magnet_shape. Therefore, the Back-EMF and the torque ripple are also
influenced by the permanent_magnet_shape.
Recent papers investigate some design alternatives
for permanent_magnet_shape in order to achieve better result in torque ripple, core losses. When the
permanent magnet synchronous machines are driven
as generator, the main concerning is about the BackEMF harmonic contents that are relevant to power
quality (EL-HASAN e LUK, 2003).
The Back-EMF harmonic contents analysis are important in design consideration whereas the harmonic
contents influence the machines losses and the
torque ripple.
This paper describes the analytical model for axial
flux permanent magnet synchronous machines with
circular permanent_magnet_shape and rectangular
coil, vice-versa, and axial flux permanent magnet
machines with circular permanent_magnet_shape and
circular coil. Furthermore, advantages, disadvantages
and some issue are discussed, such as harmonic contents and total_harmonic_distortion.

General Machine Characteristics

At first, all models described in this paper regard
the ideal model, i.e., neglecting the border effect and
the permeance function around the permanent magnet.
As mentioned, the machine investigated in this paper
is an axial flux permanent magnet synchronous machine with rotor yoke similar to Fig. 1. This kind of
machine has been adopted in order to make the proposed winding and permanent_magnet_shape feasible.

Figure 4 shows the top view of the displacement

degrees), respectively.

The coil pitch and the pole pitch are considered

The virtual coil showed in Fig. 2 passes over the

The permanent magnet area covered by the virtual
coil should be divided in two parts, called AIN and
AOUT as shown in Fig. 3. Thus it makes easier the
analytical analysis when this virtual coil comes to
real situation in a permanent magnet machine, where
the permanent magnet are placed side-by-side as
shown in Fig. 4.

The virtual coil showed in Fig. 5 passes over the

the same previous way, the permanent magnet area
covered by the virtual coil should be divided in two

simplify the analytical analysis when this virtual coil
comes to real situation in a permanent magnet machine, where the permanent magnet are placed sideby-side as shown in Fig. 4.
As should be noted in Fig. 6, the area covered by the
coil, AIN, has vertical symmetry and can be divided
in two equal parts, called A1 and A2. In this way, the
total area of AIN is defined as twice A2. Taking it into
account, the calculus of A2 has similar formulation
that previous shown for AIN in rectangular coil with
different limits of integration.

Harmonic Content For Analytical Results

5.1 Circular Permanent Magnet Shape and Rectangular Coil
In (EL-HASAN e LUK, 2003), the authors use
the machine as AC generator and the main concerning was about the generation of harmonic contents.
Here, the harmonic contents are investigated and
shown for the analytical Back-EMF waveform.
The harmonic content for the Back-EMF waveform
is shown in Fig. 11.

Figure 12. Harmonic content for circular coil.

5.3 Conventional Trapezoidal Back-EMF waveform
To analyze the harmonic contents of the both
configurations presented and make any conclusion
about the advantages and disadvantages is necessary
to compare it with the harmonic content of the conventional trapezoidal Back-EMF waveform.
The conventional trapezoidal machine regarded in
this paper has permanent magnets with length equal
to width. The value for the length is 2
. In this
way, regarding that    1,   1,
1
and that the machine has ideal Back-EMF waveform,
with 120 electrical degrees in top flat, that is given
by means of (18), the Back-EMF waveform is shown
in Fig. 13.

The harmonic content for the conventional trapezoidal Back-EMF is shown in Fig. 14.
For DC PMSM, the triplen harmonics do not produce
torque, whereas the ideal current waveform has not

For the first harmonic, the value of the trapezoidal is higher than rectangular and circular coils. The

it will produce the lower torque.

Torque Comparison For Analytical Results

In order to compare how the harmonic content
contributes to torque, the analytical models for BackEMF showed above have been simulated. The machines with these Back-EMF waveforms have been
fed by a conventional three-phase inverter in six-step
mode. The model neglects the saturation effect in the
core and takes into account an ideal current waveform with 1A of peak value.
The Figure 16 shows a comparison between the
torque waveforms for trapezoidal, rectangular and
circular.

The finite element analysis provides results with
great accuracy compared to real results, whereas the
finite element analysis takes into account the relative
permeance of the materials and border effects. In this
way, finite element analysis has been employed to
get the flux linkage waveform and Back-EMF waveform for both configurations proposed and for the
conventional trapezoidal machine. The software
employed in simulation is FEMM (MEEKER). All
waveforms are normalized by means of 4  
AB@.

Conclusion

The analytical models have been described for
permanent magnet synchronous machines with circular permanent_magnet_shape and rectangularcircular
coil_shape. A comparison between the proposed
models and conventional trapezoidal model has been
presented and the harmonic contents have been analyzed.
As shown, the analytical models proposed and FEA
models show good accuracy.
To employ the machine as generator, the best configuration is the machine with circular permanent magnets and rectangular coils, whereas THD for this
machine is the lowest and, consequently, the lowest
losses value. As motor, this machine has the highest
torque ripple as shown in Table II.
