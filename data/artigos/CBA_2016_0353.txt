Abstract This article presents an analysis for control of a constrained serial planar redundant manipulator
in operational space. A constraint of one dimension is considered to the manipulator chain and the constrained
Jacobian matrix is found for a further analysis of manipulability. Based on a modified Jacobian a control scheme
is proposed where the end-effector follows a predefined trajectory. Simulation in software and experiment in a
real robot are performed in order to validate the study.

Introduction

Redundant serial manipulators with kinematic
constraint are able to perform pre-defined motions
even with the imposed constraint. The manipulability analysis is an important topic for defining
paths from a given initial configuration, since it is
an indication of how the manipulator can move.
For industrial applications a kinematic constraint
can be seen as a confined environment (Simas et
al., 2013 Everist and Shen, 2009).
A general discussion about manipulability can
be found in (Siciliano et al., 2009) manipulability of constrained systems is discussed in (Wen
and Wilfinger, 1999) and for constrained serial
manipulators in (From et al., 2014). A geometrical approach can be found in (Park and
Kim, 1998 Wen and OBrien, 2003). A control
scheme based on the constrained Jacobian in operational space for constrained manipulators is discussed in (Coutinho et al., 2014 Coutinho, 2015).
This paper presents a general formulation to
determine the Jacobian of a constrained serial manipulator. The analysis is addressed to a redundant planar manipulator with four joints and a
control scheme is proposed for manipulator tracking trajectory problem. A specific analysis of the
manipulability of the manipulator is presented.
Simulation results and experiment with an industrial robot are also presented.

System Overview

A general formulation to obtain the end-effector
velocity of a serial robotic manipulators with a
velocity constraint in a point which belong to its
kinematic chain is presented below. A general system with revolute joints can be seen in Figure 1,
the base frame F0 and F1 are initially located in
the same place. Frame Fi (i  1, ..., n) is associated to the i-th link.
The definition of frames are before the constraint Fk  in the constraint Fc  after the constraint Fk+1  in the end-effector Fe . The velocity

Planar manipulator

Here we consider a planar manipulator with 4 revolute joints and a velocity constraint in the chain.
A schematic representation of the planar manipulator with a constraint between the joints 3 and
4 is presented in Figure 2. The manipulator is
redundant in order to keep end-effector mobility
even with a constraint somewhere in the chain.
In a planar the problem, a selection matrix S
is defined to represent only the movement in the
x and y axes as well orientation

Manipulability

The manipulability is an index that represents the
manipulator distance to singular configurations.
For a given Jacobian matrix J the manipulability
measure is

In order to analyze the manipulability of a
constrained serial manipulator two Jacobian matrices must be taken into account, the geometric
Jacobian until the joint before the constraint and

be generated by the manipulator while the force
ellipsoid characterizes the forces generated from
the joint torques.
For a given Jacobian matrix J, the singular
value decomposition of (JJ T )1 and JJ T are used
to to determine the velocity and force ellipsoids
respectively. Using
(JJ T )1  U 2 V

Figure 4 Constrained Manipulability Measure
the constrained Jacobian. For the manipulator
described in this work these matrix, J3B and Jer ,
are defined in (9) and (14) respectively.
The manipulability of J3B is a measure of how
efficiently the constrained manipulator can generate the movement in F3 required to generate
the desired trajectory of the end-effector. Using
SJ3B in (21) comes the Manipulator Manipulability Measure (wM ), defined in (From et al., 2014)

for 2  0 or 2   the wM  0 confirming
the singularity analysis of J3B in subsection Planar
Manipulator and the manipulability as a singularity index.
For the constrained Jacobian matrix, which is
only dependent on the restriction type and kinematics of the joints after the constraint, the manipulability indicates the possibility of generating
the desired trajectory in the end-effector associated with the use of the constraint velocity vector
in (13). Now using Jer in (21) comes the Constrained Manipulability Measure (wC ), also defined in (From et al., 2014)
q
T ,
wC  detJer Jer
the expression of wC does not provide immediate insight about singularity, so this expression is
omitted. The wC depends on four parameters l3 ,
l4 , l (l and all li can be seen in Figure 2) and
4 . Using l3  330 mm and l4  210 mm, the
graph of Figure 4 shows the wM according to 4
and l. When l approaches l3 the manipulator is
close to the singularity also confirming the singularity analysis in subsection Planar Manipulator,
in this case for Jer . For a fixed value of l (case
treated in this article) the largest manipulability
values occur at 4  4.
The manipulability ellipsoids are indices that
measure the manipulator performance. The velocity ellipsoid characterizes the velocities that can

where  is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. The
velocity ellipsoid is the ellipsoid with corresponding axis size from eingvalues by  and direction
to the respective eigenvectors of matrix U . Along
the direction of the major axis of the velocity ellipsoid the manipulator can move at higher speeds
while at the direction of the minor axis effector
lower speeds are reached. For force ellipsoid just
do the singular value decomposition of JJ T and
apply the same precept as velocity ellipsoid, so
the larger the length of axis more force can be
achieved by the manipulator.
According to the duality forcevelocity the
axes of the velocity ellipsoid and force ellipsoid
are the same while the dimensions of the respective axes are proportionally inverse. So the larger
the length of axis more force can be achieved by
the manipulator.
From now on using manipulator dimensions
of l1  380 mm, l2  390 mm, l3  330 mm
and l4  210 mm plus the restriction size of
l  230 mm the ellipsoids related to J3B and Jer
can be drawn. Since it is a planar manipulator
the ellipsoids have 3 dimensions corresponding to
x axis position, y axis position and orientation.
To simplify the view, the orientation is rejected
and ellipsoids are drawn considering only the manipulator position. The defined set of joint angles

T
are   4 4 4 4
.
The force ellipsoids corresponding to J3B and
Jer are shown in Figure 5. As ellipsoids of Figure
5 have an area, an movement can be done in the
manipulator workspace (the reach of movement is
proportional to ellipsoid axes) even with the constraint.

Simulation

In order to perform simulation and experiment the
manipulator with 4 revolute joints is modeled from
Motoman DIA 10 robot. To represent a planar
manipulator specific joints of the robot are considered, as shown in Figure 6, trunk (frame 1)
plus the joints identified by frames 2, 3 and 4 of
the robot left-arm.
A simulation, performed with the MATLAB software and Robotics Tollbox for MATLAB (Corke, 2011), is presented for the planar constrained manipulator in which a predefined path has to be followed by the end

confirmed by Figure 8, which displays the velocity

where t is the current time and T is the total time

for T  100, t ranges from 0  t  100. Through
this method it is possible to simulate the total trajectory time by changing only one variable in the

with simulation and experiment trajectories) can
be seen in Figure 7.
The control scheme used is defined in (18),
proportional derivative plus feed-forward controller using (19) and (20). The velocity constraint
is located on axis y in Fc , so to comply with this
constraint the link 3 of the manipulator can move
only in the direction of axis x in Fc . Thus it can

The trajectory error for the simulation is
shown in Figure 9. The orientation error is virtually zero and as the error module on the axes
x and y, despite inicial oscillation, are less than
5 mm (or about 2 of the length of the last link)
so the end-effector successfully followed the trajectory.

Figure 9 Trajectory error simulation and experiment
is performed using the Robot Rancouter Protocol
(Wanson and Wen, 2011) and the calculations required for control loop are implemented in MATLAB software.
In the experiment the velocity at the constraint is shown in Figure 8. Most values are located within the range of 4 mms except for occasional noises. So the real robot, even attaining
a good performance, not achieve the same level of
the simulation.
The trajectory error of the end-effector, represented in Figure 9, has errors of about 5 mm in
axes x and y (about 2 of the last link length), so
it can be considered that the end-effector follows
the trajectory defined in (22).

Conclusions

This paper shows that the use of constrained Jacobian with the control scheme presented succeed
to follow a trajectory and respect the constraint
on the kinematic chain of constrained manipulator. The actual experiment was not able to get
the same simulation performance with regard to
velocity in the constraint.
Regarding manipulability, the closer is the
constraint of a joint more the manipulator is near
of a singular configuration. Therefore putting constraints nearby the joints should be avoided if possible. The geometrical approach allows identify
the singularities without the analisys of manipulability.
Future work includes propose a more efficient
control law, relate the manipulability with the trajectory in addition to making a statistical analysis
of signals involved in control.
