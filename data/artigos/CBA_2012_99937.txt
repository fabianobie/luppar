Abstract This work presents a novel phasor estimation algorithm based on the Generalized Delayed Signal
Cancelation (GDSC) method, for estimating phasors in numerical protective relays. The method implementation
requires the space-vector concept, Clarke (0) and Park (dq0) transforms, mathematical tools commonly used
in AC motor drives, and by means of a discrete-time formulation and few arithmetic operations, pre-determined
undesirable sequence component harmonics are canceled, extracting the positive-sequence fundamental-frequency
components, which are required for numerical protective devices algorithms.

Introduction

Protection of electrical power system is a necessary task to guarantee availability of energy to
consumers. Disturbances in the power system
may cause severe deviations in the operation conditions from the steady-state and provoke interruptions in the power supply. Protective relays are
devices used to monitor such disturbances and, if
necessary, open only the circuit breakers for interrupting the fault currents and keeping the rest
of the system free from the consequences of the
short-circuit currents and related damages caused
by them.
Unlike the conventional relays (electromechanical and static), modern relays are multifunctional devices, containing most of the available protection functions, telecommunication capability and controlautomation logic design in
the same housing. They are really considered intelligent_electronic_devices (IED), all this thanks
to embedded digital electronics.
Numerical relays are new developments of
first computer relays with digital signal processing (DSP) optimized for real time performance.
In order to accomplish its functions, a protection relay must distinguish the type of the fault
(which phases are involved) and also determine
the exact component of the power system to be
isolated. For this it is usually necessary to evaluate sequence components andor harmonic com-

ponents of the three-phase voltages and currents
separately. Accuracy in estimating phasors is then
a very important task of a protection relay to
ensure, for example, it is responding to the fundamental frequency components of both currents
and voltages and not to high frequency components generated during a switching transient or
inrush phenomenon. Further, the phasor estimation must be fast for minimizing the consequences
of the fault to the power system
This paper proposes the use of the generalized delayed cancelation method (GDSC) for obtaining the positive, negative or zero sequence
components of the fundamental-frequency component (or any harmonic) of a three-phase voltage or
current in numerical relays. The performance of
the GDSC method is compared to discrete-Fourier
transform (DFT) based algorithms in terms of accuracy and response time. Case tests based on
simulated three-phase signals and also using actual fault voltages and currents are presented.

A Novel Phasor Estimation Method for
Numerical Protective Relays

originally proposed for grid-connected power electronic converters, usually used in renewable generation systems, active power filters and uninterruptible power supplies (UPS). The GDSC uses a

some stages, filtering of undesirable components
of three-phase signals, as presented in (Neves
et al., 2010 Neves et al., 2011). Although GDSC
has a frequency adaptive version only the nonadaptive version is applied in this paper, for providing a comparison with the DFT-based method.

Space-Vector Formulation

A space-vector (SV) is a complex time-dependent
representation of a polyphase system expressed in
an orthogonal reference frame. In practice, the application of the Clarke transformation, as referred
in (Duesterhoeft et al., 1951), to the instantaneous
phase values of a three-phase signal results in such
vectorial quantity that represents, together with
a homopolar component, any generic three-phase
quantity. Fig. (2) shows the discussed concept
graphically.

, in which k is the current sample, T is the sampling period, i refers to considered phase (ia,b,c),
h is the harmonic component order, 0 indicates homopolar component,  is the displacement angle
of the considered signal in rad,  is the electric angular velocity in radsec, t is time in sec
(h)
and Si represents peak value of sampled signal
si (kT ).
It is important to distinguish between the
concepts of SV and phasor. Although phasors
are also complex quantities, they belong to the
frequency domain and represent a pure sinusoid,
while SV has a more general concept and represents a polyphase time-domain instantaneous set
of signals, commonly three-phase signals, which
can be sinusoidal or not.
In spite of these different characteristics, there
is a link between SVs and phasors, that can clearly
be seen if, in the Clarke formulation, the threephase set of signals are conveniently expressed and
manipulated.
Considering the h-th order harmonic and substituting (5) in (1), it follows that

are phasor representations of the h-th Fortescues
positive- and negative-sequence h-th order harmonic components (Fortescue, 1918) of the considered three-phase system.
It can be noticed that, due to exponential
terms in the right member of (6), h-th harmonic
SV component can be decomposed into h-th harmonic positive- and negative-sequence rotating, or
time-dependent, phasors.
Development of (2) clearly shows that the
homopolar component is the same described by
Lyons transformation in (Lyon, 1954) and will be
treated later in this work.

2.2

Theoretical Approach of Generalized Delayed
Signal Cancelation

One may notice that the h-th harmonic positivesequence space-vector component present in a
given signal rotates (h) times faster than the
fundamental frequency component space-vector.
Similarly, the negative-sequence vector component rotates at speed (h). Because of this fact,
it is possible to conveniently operate the currenttime space_vector and a delayed time one, in such
a way that a specific harmonic component may be
eliminated, preserving rest of signal components.
In this sense, the GDSC method can be viewed as
a mathematical transformation, summarized in a
discrete-time implementation as follows

shown in 3. Constant a  0.5 is then used to correct the magnitude of the obtained fundamentalfrequency vector component.

a fundamental-frequency positive-sequence vector
component and a 4-th harmonic positive-sequence
vector component as shown in Fig. 2. The space
vectors obtained using the samples taken half fundamental period before are also shown. The delayed fundamental-frequency vector component is
opposite to the current one. However, since the
4-th harmonic vector rotates four times faster,
the delayed component is aligned with the current one. In the GDSC transformation of this example, the delayed signal vector is multiplied by
ej and the result is added to the current vector,
canceling the 4-th harmonic vector and doubling
the fundamental-frequency vector component, as

For protection devices algorithms it is also
important the estimation of the homopolar, or

is easy to show that the GDSC transformation is
also suitable for phasor estimation of single-phase
signals. From (5, again considering the h-th order

The results expressed in (16), (17) and (20) indicate that the space-vector formulation together
with the GDSC filtering technique, it is feasible
to estimate both current and voltage phasors for
numerical protective relays.
For validating the proposed method, computational simulations were made in Matlab,
aiming the comparison of the proposed method
with the application of discrete Fourier transform
(DFT). Both methods were included in a preexisting model of numerical distance relay. Initially, three-phase voltage and current signals with
known positive-sequence, negative-sequence, zerosequence and harmonic components were applied
to the relay model, for allowing to verify the precision of the phasor estimation methods. Real
disturbance signals, obtained from digital disturbance registers were also applied to the estimation
algorithms for further fair comparisons of the exposition to more severe conditions for phasor detection, like short-circuits and inrush currents.

Applying Synthesized Signals

To show the performance of the GDSC method applied for estimating phasors in numerical distance
relays, a comparison with DFT technique takes
place in present section. The main idea is to expose the proposed algorithm to known pre-defined
signals, plenty of positive- and negative-sequence
harmonic components and DC offsets.
Results depicted in Fig. (4) and (5) show current profiles measured by numerical relays when
they are suddenly exposed to signals containing fifth (6.0) and eleventh (3.5) negativesequence harmonic, seventh (5.0) and thirteenth
(3.0) positive-sequence harmonic and of DC off-

is maintained by the GDSC stages, while a set of
other components are eliminated. Stage A eliminates the components 0 + 2n, n  Z, stage B
eliminates 1 + 4n and so on.
Then, when all A to E transformations are sequentially applied to the acquired signal, considering h  1 or 1, for FFPS or FFNS estimation,
the overall effect is DC offset, all even harmonic
components and odd harmonics under 32nd order
are eliminated.
Application of all transformations consumes
345 (almost 96 of sampling window) in the filtering process. In terms of computational effort,
twenty real multiplication and sixteen real sums
are used. These two observations indicate that a
cascaded GDSC operation is similar to one DFT
operation in terms of computational burden.
It should be pointed out that phasor estimation using the proposed method leads directly to fundamental-frequency sequence components (FFPS and FFNS), contrary to DFTbased techniques that, due its single-phase nature,
are applied to phase quantities, requiring application of Fortescues transformation for obtaining
the sequence components. Despite this property
of GDSC-based algorithms, in the present case,
Fortescues inverse transformation was applied to
the sequence components calculated to obtain the
phase quantities, allowing the insertion of the proposed methods in the preexisting model of a distance relay.
Literature (Phadke et al., 1977 Phadke et al.,
1979) present a symmetrical component based distance relay (SCDR), another paradigm for distance relaying modeling that really allows to take
full advantage of the proposed method, since
GDSC output naturally provides FFPS and FFNS
measurements. Additionally, the use of referred
form of modeling foment reduction of computational burden of DSP, achieved by application of a
single performance equation capable of both identify faulty phases and calculate distance to fault.
The integration of the GDSC to the SDCR will be
addressed in another article.

set (25), all percentages referred to fundamental
harmonic.
It could be noted that both methods have the
same performance, what is inferred by closeness of
magnitude and phase angle plotted curves. This
reveals that performance of GDSC in estimation
of phasors is similar to that of the ordinary DFT
method, i.e. same accuracy and response time,
even in the presence of severe harmonic distortion
and offset.
One may note that, because of the use of the
same anti-aliasing filter in both methods, harmonics above the cut-off frequency are already eliminated in both and the capability of removing a
wide range of harmonics presented by the Fourierbased method is needless.
3.2

Applying a Real Disturbance

Protective relays must be able to filter highfrequency and DC superimposed signals, delivering to its internal algorithm only fundamentalfrequency signals. The proposed method is compared with DFT while exposed to real disturbances line single-phase short-circuit and inrush
currents.
Both disturbances are extracted from Comtrade registers, acquired from real events recorded
in digital disturbance recorders (DDR).
A single-phase short-circuit in phase A of a
medium size line causes a sudden phase angle
change, unbalance, high-frequency and DC components in the line currents.
The currents and voltages depicted in Fig. (6)
to (9) show that the proposed method has approximately the same accuracy and response speed as

Conclusion

1. The GDSC method applied for estimating
phasor shows similar accuracy and response
time when compared to DFT-based method.
For that, one expects that an anti-aliasing filter ensures cut-off frequency below high order
transformation applied
2. The response speed of the estimation based
on GDSC can be reduced if less stages of
GDSC are employed, but one may adjust
anti-aliasing filter operation to eliminate not
covered signal components
3. Calculation of many impedance loop equations is not necessary in numerical distance relay algorithm which employs GDSC
method for phasor estimation. That is because it directly provides separate positivesequence and negative-sequence phasors of
fundamental-frequency, allowing the application of symmetrical component modeling of
relay (Phadke et al., 1977 Phadke et al.,
1979)
4. The proposed method, as presented here, is
not frequency adaptive, and the DFT is not
either. However, the GDSC can be modified
for tracking the system frequency with a little
increase in the computational effort and without introduction of delays in the estimation,
by using a yet developed enhanced version of
GDSC (Neves et al., 2010 Neves et al., 2011)

5. As seen in estimation of zero-sequence phasor
component, phasor estimation using GDSC
can deal with single-phase signals, indicating that it can substitute a single-phase DFT
module, when there is no need to eliminate
all harmonic components present in signal.
