Abstract This note presents the development of a robust multivariable controller for the UUV (Unmanned
Underwater Vehicle) LAURS. The controller developed takes into consideration random delays introduced by
the Networked Control System architecture. In previous studies, Robust Control techniques were applied to
underwater vehicles in order to ensure the performance of the closed-loop system in face of modelling errors
such as hydrodynamic coefficients. The implications of random time delays has been often neglected or handled
by elaborate techniques like Stochastic Control that are difficult to implement in highly coupled multivariable
systems. This paper presents a different and simple approach for ensuring performance in Networked Control
Systems with time delays. This approach is based on the LQGLTR (linear quadratic Gaussian controller with
loop transfer recovery) method. For this purpose, the velocity control of the unmanned underwater vehicle
LAURS, built at the School of Engineering of University of Sao Paulo is developed. The effectiveness of the
controller is evaluated after its discretization and simulation with a non-linear and multivariable plant simulator.

Introduction

Modern control systems have several sensors and
actuators. This increasing number of devices leads
to a more complex and unreliable system. However, instead of wiring each device to a central
controller in an old peer-to-peer fashion, a feasible way to design these systems is to distribute
these devices over a network.
There are several types of reliable and low cost
networks that can be used in Networked Control
Systems (NCS), for instance CANbus or Ethernet. The distributed architecture has also the advantage of reducing cost and weight, improving
flexibility, ease of maintenance and fault diagnosis. It can be said that the more the communication networks evolve and the complexity of control
systems increases, the more the NCS architecture
will become popular and feasible. Even though
these networks are reliable and well established,
they have bandwidth constraints. This limitation
begets the major drawback of using a network
the random delays.
In spite of being random, the probability density function of these delays can be estimated for

a particular case. Based on this information, the
uncertainty that the delays bring into the model
can be quantified by a multiplicative error. Later,
following the LQGLTR methodology, the multiplicative error is applied to derive the stability
barrier used at the loop-shaping process.
The main goal of this paper is to instigate the
use of robust controllers in the field of NCSs. The
principle is that the controller can be robust to
random delays introduced by the network. For the
general purpose of this paper, a LQGLTR controller is developed for an unmanned underwater
vehicle (UUV) in a NCS.
Recently, underwater vehicles have become a
subject of great matter for commercial and academic purposes, following the need of offshore industries and the progress of new technologies. The
development of long life batteries and precise navigation instruments incited the use of these types
of vehicles to various applications, for instance
exploration and operation in great sea depths and
adverse environments. In order to accomplish a
mission, the vehicle must have a policy for reference trajectory control. In this paper, the velocity
control of the vehicle is developed, and its guid-

ance is led to a future implementation. The UUV
model has six degrees of freedom and is well known
for being highly non-linear and coupled.
In previous studies, (Souza et al., 2004 Chin
et al., 2005) applied robust control techniques to
underwater vehicles in order to ensure the performance of the closed-loop system in face of modelling errors such as drag and added mass coefficients and the actuators dynamics. In general
applications, the consequences of random time delays are often neglected. On the other hand, techniques like Stochastic Control are too elaborate
to implement in complex systems such as the underwater vehicle. (Nilsson, 1998) devised an optimal stochastic controller for a distributed digital control system, but this method is not simple to implement in the UUV due to the plant
model being very complex and the many performance requirements. (Luck and Ray, 1990) proposed a scheme that introduces timed buffers after each transfer. These buffers are designed to
be longer than the maximum delay expected in
the network. Also considering the time delays,
(Takarabe et al., 2010) proposes a control solution
for a remotely underwater vehicle that is based
on PI controllers with feedback-feedforward structure. The controller parameters are defined as a
function of the estimated delays for a particular
network. However, (Takarabe et al., 2010) neglects the coupling between the vehicle degrees of
freedom, addressing only SISO systems. Other approaches to the problem of NCSs with LQGLTR
are done by (Hristu-Varsakelis and Zhang, 2008)
and (Sun et al., 2010), by focusing on medium
access policies and communication sequences.
This paper presents a different and simple approach for ensuring performance in NCSs with
time delays. This approach is based on LQGLTR
methodology. The controller for velocity of the
UUV is developed. The effectiveness of the controller is evaluated after its discretization and simulation with a non-linear plant simulator.
This work is organized as follows The underwater vehicle equations of motion are detailed in
the next session. Uncertainty modelling and the
effect of time delays are addressed in section 4.
Section 5 states the LQGLTR methodology and
presents the controller development, and section 6
explains the simulation and discusses the results
obtained. Finally, section 7 contains the concluding remarks.

being multivariable, high coupled, and non linear (Faltinsen, 1990 Paster, 1986 Roberts and

Communication Network Uncertainty

As stated above, the introduction of random time
delays is one of the main drawbacks of using a
communication network to interconnect a control system. However, these delays can be estimated by conducting an experiment on the particular network in which the control system is inserted. The experiment consists in adding to the
network two nodes, starting transferring identified messages between them, and logging information regarding relevant instants of each identified message. Synchronization of timers and timestamping of departure and arrival of messages are
done on both nodes. It is important to note that
the insertion of the two nodes results in a more
loaded network, and it causes the estimate of the
delays to be conservative. Finally, an array of previous delays is stored for posterior analysis. Based
on this data, a probability density curve can be
drawn, such as shown in figure 2. The curve shown
in figure 2 gives essential information about the
magnitude and distribution of the delays. That
stated, a maximum delay Tmax can be chosen as
a conservative approach.

Uncertainty modelling

The uncertainties related to the time delays are
estimated by a multiplicative error between the
delay-free model represented by GN (j) and the
model with delays expressed by GR (j). In this
work, a maximum delay Tmax is assumed for all
inputs, so that GR (j) is represented by
GR (j)  eTmax j I33 GN (j).

(6)

The multiplicative error is calculated by
M (j)  GR (j)  GN (j)GN (j)1 , (7)
and substituting the definition of GR (j) in the
last expression
M (j)  eTmax j I33 GN (j)GN (j)GN (j)1 .
(8)
By taking the norm of M (j) from the equation
above, it follows
M (j)  eTmax j  1.

(9)

From the Nyquist plot of M (j), shown in figure
3, it can be seen that the magnitude of M (j)
changes periodically, as the frequency increases.
The figure 4 presents M (j) as function of frequency, and the behavior of the multiplicative error can be seen clearly. The stability barrier used
later in the LQGLTR control methodology is the
inverse of M (j) for each frequency.

The problem addressed by the LQGLTR control theory is to find, for a linear system with
zero-mean Gaussian noise, a feedback-control law
which minimizes a quadratic cost. The solution to this problem comes from the separation principle, which asserts that the optimal
feedback-control law can be obtained by two steps
First, the optimal state is estimated by minimizing E(x  x)T (x  x) with the use of a
Kalman Filter (which has the same structure as

Jacobian matrices. The equation 4 is expressed
such as   (,  ), and the linearized model is
then given by

a state observer). Second, the estimated state
is considered in the solution to the LQ problem
(which minimizes a deterministic cost) as if it
was an exact measure. However, when the separation principle is applied, the robustness properties from the Kalman Filter or the full-state
feedback control problem are lost. As a result,
the LTR process is used. For detailed information, refer to (Maciejowski, 1989 Skogestad and
Postlethwaite, 1996 Cruz, 1996). (Cruz, 1996)
summarizes the LQGLTR control technique and
presents it as a sequence of steps that leads to the
choice of the controller. This procedure is detailed
at the remaining of this note.
5.1

Performance Specifications

The performance specifications ensure good reference trajectory tracking, disturbance rejection,
and measurement noise rejection. For these purposes, a pair of values (gain and frequency) is
defined for each one of the three specifications.
The tolerance for reference tracking is a 20 deviation for inputs with frequency up to 1rads.
This means that the system is capable of following closely a step input with a first-order pre-filter
with time constant larger than one second. External disturbances are mainly introduced by ocean
waves and currents. However, it can be assumed
that ocean waves have a maximum frequency of
0.25Hz (Fossen, 1994). Therefore, the controller
is designed to attenuate disturbances by at least
80 for frequencies lower than 1.57rads. The
measurement noise with frequency starting from
100rads is also intended to be rejected by 90.
This means that the sensors used for this application are not precise when operated at frequencies
higher that 100rads. Besides that, zero steadystate error for step inputs is achieved by adding
integrators to each plant input.

yaw angular velocity of 3 sec. A verification of
the model is done by comparing the natural response of the linearized and non-linear systems,
where simulations with initial conditions around
the nominal points are done. and the linear model
is considered reasonable.

Loop-shaping

The synthesis process aims to met the performance specifications by loop-shaping the openloop system function GN (j)K(j). The stability condition is met by placing the closed loop singular values

First, it is worth emphasizing that when developing the controller considering the performance specification of zero steady-state error for
step input, integrators are added to the model of
the plant. But after the definition of the controller, the integrators are removed from the plant,
and added to the controller structure.
(Cruz, 1996) details three steps to derive a
possible controller. The first step consists in
choosing  and L values so that the singular values

met the performance and stability barriers. In this
paper, the matrix L is chosen to be

(16)

in order that all the singular values 1 , 2 , and
3 represented by expression 15 become equal for
each frequency. Besides that, the singular values
from equation 15 are placed in a straight line with
a decay of 20dBdec. Hence, the choice of L allows
an easy loop-shaping.
The second step is to find the Kalman Filter
gain matrix H, so that the singular values of the
target loop transfer matrix in equation 17 approximates the singular values obtained in expression
15.
GKF  C(jI  A)1 H
(17)
This step is done by using the  and L defined
in step 1 as parameters to solve an Algebraic Ricatti equation, from which its solution  is used
to calculate the H matrix H  1 CT .
At this point, it is important to verify if the
singular values of the target loop transfer matrix
still met the performance and stability barriers.
The final step consists on the LTR procedure,
which aims to recover the behaviour of the target loop transfer matrix to the open loop system.
This last step is done by choosing the parameter 
in order to solve another Algebraic Ricatti equation, from which its result K is applied to derive

The controller has

K(s)  G(sI  A + BG + HC)1 H.

(18)

In figure 5, the singular values of G(j)K(j) are
shown. It can be seen that the gain is high for
lower frequencies, ensuring good reference tracking and disturbance attenuation. On the other
hand, the gain is low for higher frequencies, guaranteeing satisfactory noise rejection. It is clear
from figure 6 that the singular values of CN (j)
are lower than the stability barrier, assuring a stable closed-loop system.

response of the system is considered satisfactory.
Further implementations may control depth by
the actual state variable z instead of angular velocity q. Figure 11 shows that the control effort X
remains close to 390N. Figure 12 shows that the
control effort N also stays constant after a transient period. On the other hand, figures 10 and
12 show that there is a constant error between the
intended q and M and the actual ones. However,
in absolute values, the error in q is almost negligible. The trajectory of the vehicle can be seen
on figure 13. The simulation is executed for 60s,
so that the yaw angular velocity of 3 s yields a
curve of 180 at the end of the simulation.

followed correctly, then that simulation must be
done using the linearized system models adopted
during the controller synthesis. On the other
hand, if the simulation aims to predict how the
real system is going to behave, that simulation
must be done using the model that better approximates the reality.
That stated, the simulation performed in this
paper uses the non-linear model. It is important
to note that due to the fact that the controller is
designed considering the linearized system, the response of the non-linear simulation is not as good
as the linear one. Besides that, the controller is
being applied to regions far from where it was designed to work, because the initial conditions of
the plant are chosen to be zero for all states.
The time delays between the controller and
the plant are also simulated, as seen in figure 8.
The maximum value for each delay is one sample
period. The simulation is done by MATLAB and
Simulink, and its block diagram of the non-linear
simulation is shown in figure 7.

Conclusion

The major goal of this work is to propose a simple method for ensuring that performance requirements are achieved when time delays are introduced by a NCS. For this purpose, a controller
is designed for an unmanned underwater vehicle
using the LQGLTR method. For detailed information about the methodology used, please refer
to (Cruz, 1996) and (Maciejowski, 1989).
The uncertainty modelling is focused on the
influence of the time-delays in the multiplicative
error between a real and a nominal transfer matrix. A stability barrier in the frequency domain is
found for a maximum delay, which is estimated by
performing an experiment that allows the knowledge of the delays distribution.
Performance requirements comprise reference
trajectory tracking, disturbance rejection and
measurement noise attenuation. Besides that, the
zero steady-state error for step inputs is met by
placing integrators in the plant input.
A simulator based on Simulink is devised for
studying the effect of random delays introduced by
the network between the controller and the plant.
In this simulation, the controller is in its digitized
form, and the maximum random delay considered

Results show that despite the effect of random
delays and errors caused by the linearization, the
controller behaved satisfactorily. The reference inputs considered are constant forward movement
with speed of 1ms, pitch angular velocity of 0 s,
and yaw angular velocity of 3 s.
Future research includes the implementation
of a guidance law and the study and application of
Stochastic Control techniques to UUVs. Besides
that, techniques for compensation of random time
delays, such as model predictive controllers, are
being studied.
