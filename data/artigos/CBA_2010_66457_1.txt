Abstract The best way to take advantage of photovoltaic energy is in grid connected systems, mainly because it does not
require energy storage into batteries. In such systems, inverters are responsible to turn the panels DC current into AC current
synchronized with the voltage grid, and to maximize the absorbed energy. This paper contains the project and the comparison
of two digital current controllers for a 700 W photovoltaic grid connected full-bridge inverter a proportional-integral (PI) and
a modified predictive. The controllers were compared through simulations in the PSIM software, using DLLs to simulate the
microcontroller dynamic, and through experimental results. In order to always extract the maximum power of the solar panels,
a maximum power point tracker (MPPT) algorithm based on the perturb-and-observe was also designed and simulated. The
proposed inverter is supposed to connect the photovoltaic panels of the power electronics laboratory of Federal University of
Ceará.

1. Introduction
Many sources of renewable energies have been used by
human being since remote times. By the industrial revolution
and the advent of the machinery, unfortunately these
resources fell in disuse. That situation has changed just after
the 1973-74 oil crises, when the world started to realize the
energy resource limitations. Consequently, in the middle of
the 70 decade, efforts were coordinated in order to develop
novel ways to generate energy. In that context, renewable
energies, such as solar photovoltaic, have been contemplated
with a large amount of investments. According to the
Renewable Global Status Report of the international organ
REN21 (2009), since 2005 to 2008, the world production of
photovoltaic energy almost tripled increasing from 6 GW to
more than 16 GW.
Due the great available hydrological potential, Brazil has
just realized the importance of alternative sources in 2001,
when the country was forced to ration energy in order to
supply its whole population.
Brazil is very rich in terms of solar resources due its
privileged equatorial location. Nevertheless, the investments
are not expressive when compared with countries such as

4685

Germany that in 2008 had already a photovoltaic capacity of
1.3 GW installed, while Brazil had only 12 MW (REN21,
2009)
The electric energy coming from photovoltaic panels can
be utilized in a stand-alone way, where it is stored in
batteries and consumed latterly, or it can be fed into the grid.
In Brazil is more common to find stand-alone systems
supplying small villages. However that is not the best way to
use the photovoltaic energy. In Germany, the consumers sell
their energy to dealers for a price superior to that they would
pay buying direct from them. This model is considered by
most of the scientist as ideal because there is no need of
batteries, which lowers the system price and does not
introduce storage losses. Moreover, there are also ecological
benefits in not using batteries, since they have heavy metals
in its composition.
Independent if the system is grid connected or standalone, for an inverter-based distributed generator, the power
quality largely depends on the inverter controllers
performance. Pulse width modulation (PWM) is the most
popular control technique for grid-connected inverters. As
compared with open loop voltage PWM converters, the
current-controlled PWM has several advantages such as fast

dynamic response and inherent over-current protection (Yu
and Chang, 2005).
The use of fully digital control techniques for PWM
converters is, more and more often, the preferred design
choice thanks, on the one hand, to the well known
advantages of the digital controls in terms of flexibility,
insensitivity to ageing effects andor thermal drifts, ease of
implementation and upgrade, and, on the other hand, to the
availability of powerful low-cost microcontrollers (Buso and
Mattavelli, 2006).
The two major techniques used for regulating the current
output from a current source inverter are PI control and
predictive control.
The PI regulator has a long history of use, but has the
disadvantage of a steady state phase error between the target
current and the output current, and also requires accurate
tuning to suit load parameters. (Holmes and Martin, 1996). A
predictive controller calculates the inverter voltages required
to force the output current to follow the current reference.
This method offers a potential to achieve more precise
current control with minimum distortion, but demands more
computing resources and requires a good knowledge of
system parameters.
This Paper shows the project, simulation and
implementation of both controllers and makes a comparison
between them. An MPPT algorithm was also proposed in
order to maximize the absorbed energy from the panels.

In order to obtain the dynamic model of the converter, it
was used the average model of the buck converter in
continuous conduction mode (CCM). In this approach the
switching frequency ripples are neglected and the switching
cell average model is introduced. The non-linear components
are replaced by controlled voltage and current generators and
these generators, on the other hand, can be substituted by an
ideal transformer with a suitable equivalent turn ratio (D).

synchronizer microcontroller, an ATMEGA32, is responsible
to generate a square waveform in phase with the grid, and to
generate an additional control signal informing if the main
grid parameters are in normal conditions and if the
synchronism was already achieved. These signals are
received by the main microcontroller, a dsPIC30F4013, that
is responsible to generate the PWM pulses and to implement
the digital control. This process can be seen in Figure 5.

The chosen modulation was the modified unipolar. Like
in the unipolar modulation, positive, negative and null
voltages are applied on the output filter. However, these
voltages alternates is in the same commutation frequency

In the modified unipolar modulation the upper switches
operates in grid frequency while the lower switches operates

The advantages of the modified unipolar modulation
when compared with the normal unipolar modulation are
The costs with microcontrollers are lower, because
it requires less PWMs
The control is simple, since theres no commutation
sequence. The only restriction is that the switches of
the same lag do not conduce at the same time
The commutation losses are lower, since there are
only two switches operating in high frequency.

To control the output current in PWM inverters, the most
traditional controller is the proportional integral (PI). The
performance of this control scheme depends on the selection
of the controller parameters and it worsens at high frequency
current references. Although, the PI controller assures zero
steady state error for continuous reference, it presents such
error for sinusoidal references. This error increases with the
frequency of the current reference and may become
unacceptable for certain applications (Rodríguez et al.,
2007).
The PI controller was projected analogically and, after
that, converted into the discrete domain using the Euler
approximation. In order to obtain a reliable discrete model,
the delays inherit to the trailing-edge digital modulation and
to the calculation time were considered. The ratio between
the output of the comparator (Cout) and the modulating
signal (Msig) can be modeled in Laplace domain through the
Padé approximation as

The losses on the semi-conductors are not

The distortion during the zero voltage crossing can be
corrected by changing the modulation to normal unipolar
when the output current approximates from null value

It was chosen a zero crossing frequency 15 times lowers
than the switching frequency in order to avoid high

obtained using the root locus method. To achieve the stability

As introduced by Yu and Chang (2005), the traditional

calculate the demand inverter output voltage VI (k) .
The controller must use the results of previous switching
cycles to forward estimate both the future grid voltage and
future load current. These are the causes of the controllers
poor performance under component parameter variations
(Kojabadi et al., 2006).
The proposed predictive control takes advantage of the
microprocessor speed and does not need to estimate any
parameter.
In order to guarantee that, in all cases, the calculations
will be over before the output voltage has to change its state,
it is necessary to move the objective of the computation one
step forward. Therefore, instead of computing VI (k) , it is

Assuming that the phase voltage Vg is a slowly varying
signal, as it is often the case, whose bandwidth is much lower
than the modulation and sampling frequency, it is possible to
consider Vg(k+1)  Vg(k) and thus obtaining the following
predictive control equation

Where IL (k+2) can be replaced by I0REF, the desired set

for the modulation period starting at instant (k+1)TS, that will
make the inductor current reach its reference at instant
(k+2)TS, with a two modulation period delay.

6. Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT) Algorithm
Since the PV module current-voltage characteristics will
vary according to operating conditions, so do also the output
current. Hence to maximize the output power, the inverter
must be able to vary the reference of the output current in
order to maximize the product between the panels voltage
and the output current (Imhoff, 2007). The proposed MPPT
algorithm based on the perturb-and-observe, needs just the
measurement of the photovoltaic panels voltage. The flow
diagram at Figure 10 shows how the algorithm works.

According to the maximum power transference theorem,

reduced.

As it can be seen in Figure 23, the proposed inverter
presented a peak efficiency of 92 , but it is expected that
better efficiency can be achieved by changing the switches
for ones with less resistance, and changing the modulation
strategy.

9. Conclusion
The predictive controller is capable of a very fast
dynamic response, and clearly presented superior
performance when compared to a conventional digital PI
controller. Therefore, it is very well suited to those
applications of current sources inverters where the capability
of tracking rapidly variable current reference signals is
required. That could be validated in the THD analyses and in
the step response of the controllers . On the other hand, the
predictive controller, at least in its basic implementation,
requires the measurement of the load voltage, which
generally increases the hardware for its implementation
beyond what is required by a PI controller. The implemented
prototype presented peak efficiency of 92 and current THD
of 3 and 1.7 for the PI and predictive controllers,
