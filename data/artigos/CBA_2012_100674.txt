Abstract Main goal of this paper is to investigate four proposed single-phasethree-phase AC-to-AC converters. Coupling of
input inductors of a basic topology, allows to improve the input power factor and input current waveform and the introduction of
a three-level leg allows for DC-bus voltage control. This happens without any complicated switching modulation or current feedback control. The topologies can operate with either variable or fixed output frequency. The main characteristics of the proposed
configurations are presented and experimental results verify the theoretical studies.

Introduction

When only single-phase voltage is available from the
grid, as in rural areas (Bellar et al., 2005 Machado et
al., 2005), supplying three-phase loads requires single-phase to three-phase conversion. A common and
cheap way to do that is to use a diode single-phase
bridge to feed a three-phase inverter. However, in
this case a poor power factor and a high current distortion are transferred to the grid. The power factor
can be obtained from the use of pulse-width modulated rectifiers. However, this converter employs ten
switches besides needing voltage and current sensors. In general, the use of many switches increases
the converter cost, while reducing its reliability
(Blaabjerg et al., 1999 Jacobina et al., 2001 François et al., 2000). In addition, many topologies have
been conceived to reduce the number of power
switches (Enjeti and Rahman, 1993 Jacobina et al.,
2003 2005), but most of them employ current and
voltage sensors thus increasing the complexity of the
control system. Nabae et al (1994) introduced a simple power converter that overcomes these drawbacks.
Its input current automatically follows the sinusoidal
line voltage without any current control.
In the single-phase-to-three-phase AC-DC-AC
converter shown in Fig. 1 (Topology I), the leg
formed by q1 and q 1 is common to both the Nabaes
front-end

verter formed by switches q1 , q1 , q2 , q 2 , q3 , q 3 , thus
integrating both converters. However, such converter
does not allow for dc bus voltage control. As in
(Bento et al., 2007), this problem can be solved by
replacing the common leg q1 and q1 by a three-level
Neutral-Point, NP, leg, while maintaining the advantages of Topology I, that is, improvement of both
input power factor and input current ripple without
any complicated switching modulation or complicated feedback control. Such converter is shown in
Fig. 1(b) (Topology II) but using a three-level reduced-count switch leg (Oliveira et al., 2006) instead
of the three-level NPC leg used in (Bento et al.,
2007). Also, it has been recently established that the
use of coupled inductors improves the input power
factor and current ripple of the single-phase version
of Topology I (Kwon et al., 2005 Silva et al., 2010).
The main goal of this paper is to investigate Topologies I and II and the effect of coupling their ac
inductors as in Topology III, in Fig. 1(c), and Topology IV, in Fig. 1(d). The proposed topologies can
operate with either variable or fixed output frequency
to be applied in, but not limited to, motor drive systems and UPS, respectively, in rural areas, for instance. Simulated and experimental results validate
the proposed topologies.

2.1 Model
Assumptions for the analysis in steady-state operation are (1) all components are ideal (2) the DClink voltage Vdc is larger than the peak amplitude egm
of the input voltage eg (3) the supply voltage eg, the
DC-link voltage Vdc, and voltages vCf1 and vCf2 are
supposed to be constant during the switching period
Ts (4) filter capacitors Cf1 and Cf2 have equal capacitances Cf1  Cf2  Cf and so it is for inductors, in
which L1  L2  L.

2.2 Modes of Operation
Because the power factor control stage in Topologies
I and II can be considered as particular cases of those
in Topology III and IV, respectively, only these topologies will be discussed in detail. From these the
operation of Topologies I and II will be indicated.

A. PFC Stage in Topology II
(a) Mode 1II

There are six modes of operation in the power factor
control stage for Topology II inside a switching period Ts. In order to differ topologies modes a corresponding topology number subscript will be added to
each mode in consideration.
Suppose that for t< to the inductor current iL2
flows in a decreasing way through D4, q2 and L2 and
while current iL1 is increasing. Mode I starts when
the inductor current iL2 becomes zero.

(b) Mode 2II

Mode 1II t0, t1 In this node the switch q1 is on and
the energy stored in L1 is supplied by capacitor Cf1
via diode D1. The equivalent circuit is shown in Fig.
3(a).
Mode 2II t1, t2 In this mode, the switch q1 is turned
off. At the same time the switch q4 is turned on.
Then capacitor C1 is charged via inductor L1 while
capacitor C2 is discharged by the load, as shown in
Fig. 3(b).

(c) Mode 3II

Mode 3II t2, t3 This mode starts when the switch q4
is turned off and q1 is turned on. Energy is stored in
L2, while the energy in L1 discharges. The equivalent
circuit is shown in Fig. 3(c)
Mode 4II t3, t4 This mode, shown in Fig. 3(d),
starts after all energy stored in L1 is liberated. It is
similar to Mode I, but related to the bottom side, as it
occurs for Modes 5III and 6III.
The behavior of each mode is determined by the
values of vp1a and vp2a indicated in Table 1. Figure 4
shows the currents, gating signals and the pole voltage inside one period of operation.

B. PFC Stage in Topology I
The behavior of each mode of Topology I can be
known by using Table 1.

When the current in DS1 reaches zero the upper
switch q1 takes over the current flowing through Ds1.
The current i1 continue to increase while and current
i2 decreases.

Consider Fig. 5. Suppose that for t< to the secondary
leakage inductor current iL2 flows from the previous
mode through D4, C2, q5 and L2.

Mode 3IV t2, t3 At t2, when the current i2 reaches
zero, diode D4 turns off. Current i1 continues to increase thorough q1 Fig. 5(b).

Mode 1IV and Mode 2IV t0, t2 At t0, the auxiliary
switch q5 is turned off resulting in turn on of both the
upper diode Dq1 and the diode D1, while D4 contin- ues to conduct, as shown in Fig. 5(a). The primary leakage inductor current i1 increases and the
secondary leakage inductor current i2 decreases
linearly.

Mode 4IV t3, t4 At t3 the upper switch q1 is turned
off and the auxiliary switch q4 is turned on connecting point a to point o so that the pole voltage
becomes zero, as shown in Fig. 5(c). This interval
duration is (1-D1)Ts, where D1 is the duty of the
switch q1.

Fig. 4. Main variables in Topology II

Mode 5IV and 6IV t4, t6 These modes, shown in
Fig. 5(d) starts when q4 is turned off and q1 is
turned on and energy is stored in L2 while current iL1
demagnetize.

Mode 7IV t6, t7  Mode 7IV starts after all energy in
L1 is released. It is similar to Mode 2IV but related to
the bottom side thus starting a similar sequence of
equivalent circuits occur, also related to the bottom
side, as shown in Fig. 5(e) and Fig. 5(f).
The input current is a continuous sinusoidal
waveform, the ripple frequency is twice the switching frequency, and the amplitude of the ripple component is almost zero, although the inductor currents
are in discontinuous mode.
It can be shown that the leakage inductance Lk
of the coupled inductor for unity power factor is designed as (Kwon et al., 2005)

Lk 
8 f s Po, max
where Po, max and  are, respectively, the maximum
output power and the expected efficiency of converter.
The behavior of currents is determined by the input voltages and the values of vp1a and vp2a in (2) or
(3), which are indicated in Table 2. Currents in Topologies IV are, in general, similar to those in Configuration II (Fig. 4)
Table 2 can be used for analysis of Topology III.

PWM Strategy for the Inverter

As shown in Fig. 4, the positive and negative pulses
of the common leg pole voltage, vao, have equal
widths while the other two legs modulate, as shown
in Fig. 6. This avoids high input current distortion.
Since the average value of the pole voltage in the
common leg is zero, references are

In Fig. 6, the pulse widths b and c of phase b

modulation is determined by the intersection of the

waveform r inside the modulation interval Ts. During
interval to1 the pole voltages vbp and vcp are both 
Vdc2, while during interval to2 they are both +Vdc2.

These equations have been determined by the use of
triangle equivalence in Fig. 6.
The common phase is related to the DC-bus voltage control, which is achieved with the variation of
interval tz1, resulting in the variation of the dutycycle d  aTs. The value of the duty-cycle d of the
common leg is defined from the error Vo between
the reference Vdc* and the actual dc-bus voltage Vdc,
with the help of a PI controller Rc, as shown in Fig.
7.

4 Simulation and Experimental Results
All configurations from Fig 1 have been simulated
with the switching frequency of 10 kHz, an input
voltage of 100 V, 60 Hz, load frequency of 60 Hz,
input inductance of 1 mH, modulation index m  0.9,
and a load composed by R  10 Ohms and L  20
mH. Figures 8(a) to (d) compare the grid voltage
and current for all topologies when the common leg
is not modulated. It can be noticed that the amplitude
of input current is lightly smaller in Topologies III
and IV than that in Topologies I and II, for the same
power. They also show that the use of a three-level
common leg highly favors Topology IV (coupled
inductors) in boosting the output voltage of power
factor control stage. This feature is outlined in Figs.
9(a) and (b), which shows the boosted DC-bus voltage, for Figures II and IV, as a function of the dutycycle of the common leg. Such characteristics can be
used to control the DC-bus voltage, which feeds the
three-phase inverter, thus allowing supply variable
load. The efficacy of the voltage control in Topology
IV is shown in Fig. 10, which shows that the DC bus
voltage has been controlled after a change in the amplitude of the load current, at the expenses of an increase in the amplitude of the grid current. In contrast Topologies I and II are only able to supply fixed
loads. In addition conduction and switching losses in
Topologies III and IV are always smaller than those
in Topologies for a variation in the modulation index
from 0.1 to 0.9, as shown in Fig. 11. However, simulated results have shown that Topology II is more
advantageous than the other topologies in terms of
Total Harmonic Distortion, THD. Probably an increase in the switching frequency of the power factor
control stage will permit to improve the THD of
Topology IV.
In order to test the basic principles, Topologies I
and II have been experimentally implemented using
DSP for control. IGBTs and fast diodes have been
used. Figure 12 presents selected experimental results for Configuration III. These figures show that
this topology achieved high power factor at 60 Hz
with acceptable input current ripples see input voltage source (eg) and the input current (ig) in Fig.
12(a) without any current control and without any
curren1t template. The comparison of the input current in this figure with that obtained for Configuration II in (Bento et al., 2007), shows that coupling
greatly improves the input current waveform. Also,
the output currents at 30 Hz in Fig. 12(b), confirms
the topology ability for operating in variable output
frequencies. In addition, the pole voltages shown in
Fig. 12(c) as well as the load phase voltage in Fig.
12(d) are as expected.

The use of a three-level common leg allows the DCbus voltage control not possible with the two-level
common leg. Their main characteristics are (1) Near
unity input power factor (2) Input sinusoidal current
waveform (3) Reduced number of power switches
(4) No current or sensors to provide the input current
template (5) Independent output voltage (6) Use of
a simple DC-bus feedback control.
