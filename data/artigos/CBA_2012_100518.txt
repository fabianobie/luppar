Abstract
 Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) is a non-linear system used in the development of servomechanism, with a position loop and the d-axis stator current loop which controls the magnetic flux of the motor. Fuzzy TakagiSugeno Modeling (TS) allows the design of robust controllers based on linear matrix inequalities (LMI), using a combination set
of local linear models. The local models of the position loop of PMSM have an implicit integrator, which reduce the steady-state
error. However, the d-axis current loop does not have this integrator. This paper presents the design of robust controllers for
PMSM considering the addition of an integrator and an integrative gain in the d-axis stator current loop. This consideration is
made for other power electronic systems as DC-DC converters, but this paper analyzes the use of this technique in vector control
of PMSM. The effect of perturbations is reduced considering the H2 norm technique. The position and the d-axis stator current
loops are considered as two independent SISO systems, which give more flexibility for the pole placement. Simulation results
show the good performance of this technique.

Resumo
 O Motor Síncrono de Ímã Permanente (PMSM) é um sistema não_linear utilizado no desenvolvimento de servomecanismos, com uma malha de posição e uma malha de corrente no estator no eixo, o qual controla o fluxo_magnético do motor.
A modelagem FuzzyTakagi-Sugeno (TS) permite o projeto_de_controladores_robustos baseado em desigualdades_lineares_matriciais (LMI), usando uma combinação de modelos lineares locais. Os modelos locais da malha de posição do PMSM possuem um
integrador, o qual reduz o erro em regime estável. Não obstante, a malha da corrente do estator no eixo d não possui aquele integrador. Este artigo apresenta o projeto_de_controladores_robustos para PMSM considerando a inserção de um integrador e um
ganho de integração na malha de corrente. Esta consideração é utilizada no controle de outros circuitos de potência como os
conversores DC-DC, porém o presente artigo faz uma análise do uso desta técnica no controle_vetorial do PMSM. O efeito das
perturbações é reduzido através da técnica da norma H2. As malhas de posição e corrente são consideradas como dois sistemas
SISO independentes, o que fornece maior flexibilidade na locação dos pólos em malha_fechada. Simulações mostram o bom desempenho da técnica proposta.

Introduction

Nowadays, permanent magnet synchronous motor
(PMSM) is a powerful alternative in the implementation of variable frequency drive applications and servomechanism by its better torquesize relation and
robustness than DC motors, and by its lower torque
ripple and higher energetic efficiency than induction
motors (Udin et al., 2000 Terzic and Jadric, 2001).
On the other hand, the control of PMSM is more difficult than DC motor due to PMSM is a non-linear
system, whose parameters can change in time, affected by external load perturbations (Pillay and
Krishnan, 1988 Bose, 1997).
Vector model of PMSM is composed by two systems (Bose, 1997) the q-axis circuit that controls the
angular position or speed through the generation of
electromagnetic torque, and the d-axis circuit, that
control the magnetic rotor flux. The dq-axis voltages,

currents and fluxes are obtained by Park transformation (Bose, 1997). However, both circuits have nonlinear components that make linear controllers as PID
regulators inadequate for speed control of PMSM.
Fuzzy Takagi-Sugeno Modeling (TS) is a powerful tool in the development of robust controllers for
non-linear plants, by representing them as a Fuzzy
combination of linear systems (Takagi and Sugeno,
1985 Taniguchi et al., 2000 Taniguchi et al., 2001
Teixeira et al., 2003, Schulte, 2005 Precup et al.,
2007 Nor and Okubo, 2011). Application of TS in
speed vector control of PMSM can be founded in
(Lian et al., 2007 Jung et al., 2010 Wang et al.,
2012 Choi et al., 2012). However, there are few researches about the application of TS controllers for
the angular position of PMSM.
Generally, TS models are used with Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI), in order to get closed-loop
controllers which are robust against variations in the
parameter, considering restrictions in the control law,

the system outputs and for tracking problems (Assunção et. al, 2008, Andrea et al., 2010).
This paper analyzes the design of LMI controllers for position control of PMSM based on an augmented TS model of the motor, where an integrator
and an integrative gain is added to the d-axis circuit.
Augmented model using an integrator for non-linear
power electronics applications as Boost converter can
be found in (Montagner et al., 2010 Olalla et al.,
2009 Olalla et al., 2011). The addition of an integrator is a technique used in linear systems for tracking
problems (Ogata, 2001). This paper uses the same
methodology for the d-axis stator current loop. As a
result, the controller has two components a state
feedback and an integral controller, whose parameters are obtained using LMIs.
The d-axis and the q-axis systems are considered as SISO systems instead of an only one MIMO
system. This consideration and the addition of a state
variable in the d-axis system give more flexibility to
set the placement of the closed-loop poles using Dstability conditions. H2 norm technique is used to
reduce the effect of perturbations. Simulation results
show the potentiality of the use of the proposed TS
model with augmented plant for position control of
PMSM.

On the other hand, the d-axis flux is determined

When PMSM works below its nominal speed
(constant torque operation mode), id is set to zero to
reduce the power consumption of the motor, due to
the magnets provides enough flux. On the other hand,
when PMSM has to operate above its nominal speed
(constant power operation mode), id is negative in
order to reduce the d-axis flux d (Bose, 1997). This
technique, called flux weakening, demands the control of the d-axis stator current.

In this paper, the fuzzy membership functions
are obtained using the methodology presented in
(Taniguchi et al., 2001), which uses the maximum
and minimum values of every non-linearity of the
space-state model. In this case, the only non-linearity
of the angular position system is produced by f23, and
21  2 linear models are needed (Taniguchi et al.,
2001). The variables a231 and a231 are defined as

The determinant of Ap1 and Ap2 of equations (30)
and (31) is zero, indicating that there is an implicit
integrator in the local models (Cheng, 1999).
2.3 Augmented d-Axis Current Model
The magnetic flux depends on the d-axis stator current id (Bose, 1997), whose dynamic behavior is described in equation (3). This equation shows that
there is not an implicit integrator in the d-axis current
loop.

This research inserts an integrator and an integrative gain kI to this system. This technique is used
in linear systems for tracking problems (Ogata,
2001). Figure 1 shows the proposed augmented model for the d-axis stator current. According to Figure
1, the input u is

u  vd   k x id + k I 

(35)

Considering that the reference id* is constant during the required time for the stabilization of the output, it can be proved that (Ogata, 2001)

3.3 Pole Placement of the Local Closed Loops using
D-Stability
The position of the closed-loop poles determines the
dynamic response of the system. Considering the
region in the Laplacian lelf semi-plane S(, r, ) as
the set of complex numbers   x + jy which satisfy
the following conditions (Olalla et al., 2011)

 x <  < 0

S ( , r ,  )   x 2 + y 2 < r
 x tan() <  y

(48)

The variables Yj and Q are calculated solving the
LMI terms. The feedback gains Kj can be obtained
making Kj  Yj Q-1.

(53)

Figure 2 shows the region S(, r, ). If the poles
of the closed-loop system belong to this region, the
system has a minimum decay rate , minimum dumping coefficient   cos() and a minimum dumped
frequency d  r.sin().

3.2 Closed loop Controllers using H2 Norm
According to TS modeling, if each local model rejects perturbations, then, the global non-linear plant
will be robust against this perturbation. This paper
uses H2 norm to establish LMI conditions in order to
reduce the effect of perturbations in the system output. Considering the following local system

(49)

Where w(t) is noise and Bwi is its input vector.
The effect of the noise on the output yi should be minima. This objective can be achieved by selecting the
feedback gain Ki that minimizes the H2 norm between
the noise and the output, according to the following
optimization problem (Andrea et al., 2010)

The D-stability conditions for the angular position and d-axis current controllers can be set independently due to they have their own SISO models.
Additionally, the addition of the new state for the daxis current system gives more flexibility to set its
dynamics.
