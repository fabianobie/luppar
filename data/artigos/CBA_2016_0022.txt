Abstract This paper proposes a method for quantification of sensor faults in a flexible beam control system on the basis of the
ratio of root-mean-square (RMS) values of two measured variables (angular displacement and deflection angle). A theoretical investigation of the closed-loop dynamic relationships reveals that the RMS ratio is more closely related to the fault magnitude if
the signals are band-limited prior to the analysis. For this purpose, a wavelet filter bank is employed as a convenient form of
splitting the measured signals into different frequency bands. The proposed method is validated with actual experimental data of
a flexible beam system. By choosing an appropriate decomposition level in the filter bank, a good correlation between alterations
in the sensor gain and the ratio of RMS values was obtained (R2  0.9997), yielding a substantial improvement with respect to the
analysis in the time domain (R2  0.8587).

Introduction

The mechanical design of robotic manipulators
usually employs heavy, stiff structures in order to
achieve accurate positioning with minimal vibration.
However, many applications require the use of
lightweight, slender manipulators to facilitate
transportation, obtain higher speed and reduce
energy consumption, as well as to operate in working
environments with restricted space (Shaheed 
Tokhi, 2013). Examples include robotic arms used in
space vehicles (Xie, Kalaycioglu  Patel, 1997),
hard disk drive head-positioning systems (Yan et al.,
2013), and manipulators for intervention tasks in
nuclear applications (Chalfoun et al., 2007). In this
case, passive or active methods may need to be
employed to attenuate vibrations due to the structural
flexibility of the system.
Passive methods involve the introduction of mechanical dampers in the flexible structure, whereas
active methods rely on the use of vibration measurements in a feedback control scheme (Gervini, Hemerly  Gomes, 2013 Shaheed  Tokhi, 2013
Wang, Gu  Song, 2014). Sensors employed for this
purpose include, for example, strain-gages (Gervini,
Hemerly  Gomes, 2013), accelerometers (Scattolini
 Cattane, 1999), micro-mechanical gyros (Ortel,
Wagner  Saupe, 2013), and PZT (lead zirconate
titanate) elements (Wang, Gu  Song, 2014). An
important issue that arises in this context is the handling of sensor faults. Indeed, a reliable detection
and quantification of the fault may be crucial to allow the reconfiguration of the control system, in orISSN 2525-8311

der to restore system performance and avoid the
propagation of the fault (Scattolini  Cattane, 1999).
Moreover, by tracking the evolution of a fault over
time, it may be possible to predict the remaining useful life of the sensor by using prognosis techniques,
in order to schedule a maintenance intervention
within a suitable time frame (Vachtsevanos et al.,
2006).
The present paper is concerned with the
quantification of a sensor fault in a flexible beam
control system. Devices of this type have been
employed in many studies involving the
identification and control of flexible structures
(Shaheed  Tokhi, 2013 Gervini, Hemerly 
Gomes, 2013) as a laboratory-scale representation of
more complex systems such as micro-cantilever
sensors used in atomic force microscopy, robotic
manipulators and civil engineering structures
(Pereira et al., 2011).
It is assumed that the system operates under
closed-loop control for regulation in the presence of
external disturbances. The fault under consideration
consists of a change in the gain of the sensor
employed to measure the deflections of the beam.
Even if this change does not lead to closed-loop
instability or significant loss of regulation
performance, the quantification of the fault may be
of value as an early indicator of a complete sensor
failure.
The proposed technique employs a ratio of RMS
(root-mean-square) values of two measured quantities, which are shown to be related to the sensor gain.
A detailed analysis of the fault effect in the closed36

loop system dynamics is presented to indicate that
such a ratio of RMS values is more closely related to
the fault magnitude if a band pass filter is applied to
the measurements. For this purpose, a wavelet filter
bank is employed as a convenient form of splitting
the measured signals into different frequency bands.
The remainder of this paper is organized as
follows. Section 2 describes the flexible beam system
and the sensor fault under consideration. Section 3
provides a detailed analysis of the fault effect in the
closed-loop dynamics. Section 4 presents the
proposed method for fault quantification. A brief
description of signal decompositions using a wavelet
filter bank is provided in Section 5. The experimental
results are presented in Section 6 and concluding
remarks are given in Section 7.
2 System description

where u is the voltage applied to the motor, d is a
disturbance signal and k1, k2, k3, k4 are feedback
gains designed for asymptotically stable operation.
The angular displacement  and the corresponding
rate  are measured by an encoder (1024-line, 4X
quadrature) and a tachometer, respectively. The
deflection angle  is obtained from the strain-gage
readings with suitable calibration. The rate  is
estimated from by using a first-order derivative
filter. The control law is implemented in a digital
computer fitted with a signal acquisition module.
2.2 Sensor fault
The fault under consideration consists of a change in
the gain of the strain-gage, which is accomplished by
multiplying the actual sensor readings by a
coefficient kf. As a result, the control is calculated as

u  k1  k 2 f  k3  k 4 f  d

2.1 Flexible beam system
Fig. 1 depicts the system employed in this work. The
control task consists of rotating a thin stainless steel
beam in the horizontal plane, with suppression of the
beam vibrations, which have a fundamental natural
frequency of 3 Hz. The beam is clamped to a hub
connected to a DC motor through a set of gears.
Deflections at the base of the beam are sensed by a
strain_gage, as shown in the inset.

with  f  k f  . It is implicitly assumed that kf is
such that the closed-loop system remains
asymptotically stable. The problem then consists of
estimating kf from the measured signals  and f .

It is worth noting that the dynamic relation (7)
between the angular displacement  and the beam
deflection  does not involve the input voltage u. In
view of (7), a transfer function G(s) can be written
as

where (s) and A(s) correspond to the Laplace transforms of  (t) and  (t), respectively.

depend on these gains, as the dynamic relation (7)
between  and  does not involve the input u.
In the presence of the sensor fault under consideration, the closed-loop dynamics must be derived
under the control law (2), with  f  k f  representing the faulty sensor measurement employed in the
feedback path. Equation (2) can then be rewritten as
u   k1  k 2f   k 3  k 4f   d

(10)

where k 2f  k 2 k f and k 4f  k4 k f . The new transfer
function from D(s) to (s) is obtained by replacing
k2 and k4 with k 2f and k 4f , respectively, which leads
to

The transfer function from (s) to A(s) remains unaltered, as it does not involve the feedback gains.
The relationship between D(s), (s), A(s) and Af(s)
is depicted in Fig. 3b. Again, one should bear in
mind that the closed-loop relations are embedded in
Gdf ( s ) , which depends on the fault gain kf.

4 Proposed fault detection method

If the closed-loop system was driven by a sinusoidal
disturbance d(t) of frequency 0 rads, the angular
displacement (t) in sinusoidal steady-state would be
of the form  (t )  A sin(0 t ) , with phase assumed
to be zero without loss of generality. In view of the
block diagram in Fig. 3b, the faulty sensor measurements would be given by

 f (t )  A f sin(0 t  G ( j0 ))

Therefore, the fault gain kf could be simply obtained as

If the disturbance is not sinusoidal, a more
elaborate analysis needs to be carried out. More specifically, we will consider the case in which d is a

In the present work, the band-pass filtering is
carried out by using a wavelet filter bank. Experimental data are employed to fit a linear relation between the ratio of standard deviations   f ,bp   ,bp

unaltered.
5 Wavelet filter banks

Fig. 4 presents the basic structure of a wavelet filter
bank (Strang  Nguyen, 1996), which is an efficient
way of decomposing a signal in different frequency
bands. In this figure, y indicates the discrete-time
signal of interest, and Al, Dl denote the corresponding approximation and detail at resolution level l.

The approximation Al and the detail Dl roughly
correspond to the frequency intervals 0, 2l+1)fs and

sampling frequency (Strang  Nguyen, 1996). The
degree of spectral overlapping between the approximations and details at different levels depends on the
selectivity of the wavelet filters. The present work
adopts the length-8 filters proposed in (Paiva 
Galvão, 2012), which were designed with the aim of
obtaining improved frequency resolution.
6 Results and discussion

6.1 Experimental settings
The data acquisition and control tasks were carried
out by using the MatlabSimulink software environment (The Mathworks) with QUARC real-time
control software (Quanser Consulting). The feedback
gains were obtained by using a linear-quadratic regulator design (Franklin, Powell  Emami-Naeini,
2006) with factory settings for the state and control
weights. The resulting values were k1  20.0, k2 
93.8, k3  3.38, k4  0.89. The continuous-time control law was emulated in discrete time by using a
sampling period of 1 ms.
A derivative filter with transfer function
30s(s + 30) was used to estimate the rate  from
the measurements of The disturbance d was generated as the output of a low-pass filter with transfer
function 25(s + 25), driven by Gaussian white noise
with zero mean and standard deviation of 40. This
filter was emulated in discrete time by using the 4thorder Runge-Kutta method with step size equal to the
sampling period.
Experimental data were acquired with kf ranging
from 0.5 to 1.5, with 0.1 increments (the nominal
condition corresponds to kf  1). The data for each kf
value were acquired during 120 s. The data were
stored at a sampling rate fs  50 Hz.

6.2 Data analysis
Fig. 5 presents the random disturbance d and the
measured values of angular displacement  and deflection angle  f, for each fault gain kf employed in
the experiments. The signals are displayed over a
4-second time frame for better visualization.

These findings can be interpreted as follows. As
discussed in Section 4, the relation between kf and
  f ,bp   ,bp , as expressed by (19), approaches linearity if the analysis is restricted to a range of frequencies where  G ( j )  is approximately constant. In view of (8),  G ( j )  can be written as
 G ( j )    2   2  02 

(21)

where 0  K s  J b corresponds to the fundamental natural frequency of the beam (3 Hz). A theoretical plot of  G ( j )  as a function of frequency, as
given by (21), is shown in Fig. 6.

Figure 6. Frequency domain profile of the relation between the
magnitudes of angular displacement  and deflection angle .

Figure 5. Experimental data (initial 4 seconds).

The standard deviations of f and  were evaluated in the time domain, as well as within different
approximation and detail levels of the wavelet decomposition. In order to choose the most appropriate
decomposition level for the purpose of fault quantification, linear regression was used to obtain a relation
between the fault gain kf and the ratio   f ,bp   ,bp .
The results were compared in terms of the R2 coefficient (Draper  Smith, 1998), which is a metric usually employed to evaluate the goodness-of-fit, with
values close to one indicating a well adjusted model.
As shown in Table 3, the best fittings were obtained
at the detail levels D1 (R2  0.9927) and D2 (R2 
0.9997).

As can be seen in Fig. 6,  G ( j )  tends to one
as the frequency increases past 3 Hz, and the curve
becomes approximately flat for frequencies larger
than 6 Hz. This is the reason why good linearity was
obtained at the detail levels D1 and D2, which are
associated to frequency ranges from 6.25 Hz up to 25
Hz as shown in Table 3. It could be argued that the
best result should be obtained at D1, since the approximation of  G ( j )  by a constant value is best
at the highest frequencies. However, the largest R2
value (0.9997) was actually obtained at D2, possibly
because the corresponding signal-to-noise ratio at
this intermediate frequency range (6.25 - 12.5 Hz) is
larger compared to the frequency range associated to
D1 (12.5 - 25 Hz).
For illustration, Fig. 7a and Fig. 7b present the
relations between   f   and kf at the time domain
D2. As can be seen, the goodness-of-fit of the linear
regression model is substantially improved by using
the wavelet decomposition, thus allowing for a much
better quantification of the fault if the model was
employed to estimate kf from the ratio   f ,bp   ,bp .

7 Conclusion

This paper presented a method for quantification of
sensor faults in a flexible beam control system on the
basis of the ratio of RMS values of two measured
variables (angular displacement and deflection angle). These variables can be measured during closedloop operation, without the need to interrupt the
control task. A detailed analysis of the fault effect
revealed that such a ratio of RMS values is more
closely related to the fault gain if a band pass filter is
applied to the measurements. A wavelet filter bank
was employed as a convenient form of splitting the
measured signals into different frequency bands.
By choosing a convenient decomposition level
in the wavelet filter bank, a good correlation between
alterations in the sensor gain and the ratio of RMS
values was obtained (R2  0.9997), yielding a substantial improvement with respect to the analysis in
the time domain (R2  0.8587). This result was also
supported by a theoretical analysis of the system
dynamics within the frequency bands associated to
the wavelet decomposition levels.
Future investigations could be concerned with
possible extensions of the proposed technique for
real-time detection of faults.
