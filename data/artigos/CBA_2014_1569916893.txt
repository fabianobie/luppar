Abstract Automatic detection of impulsive signals is object of ongoing research. In the state-of-the-art,
detectors analyse time series of feature vectors computed from sliding signal windows. Features that are extracted from the audio signal include correlation against a template, spectral shape, transient analysis, and
other techniques adapted from the literature on speech processing, such as mel-cepstral coefficients and linear
predictive coding. The work presented here proposes novel features for such detectors of impulsive signals, and
these features can be derived specifically when the signal is recorded by a sensor array, as they are based on the
direction-of-arrival (DOA) of vibrational energy. When impulsive signals occur, there is a high incidence of energy coming from a specific DOA and lasting only for a brief period of time. In the literature, systems interested
in knowledge of the DOA of a signal will calculate it conditionally on detection of that signal. In this paper,
contrarily, the DOA is constantly evaluated in sliding windows, and DOA features are suggested for detection of
the impulsive signals. The estimated DOA may also be useful for recovering a higher SNR signal, from which the
single-microphone features traditionally used for signal detection can be derived. Typical examples of impulsive
signals are gunshots, explosions, breaking glass, car collisions, and thunder they also occur, in biology, as sperm
whale clicks, as heartbeats, and as action potentials.

Resumo Deteccao automatica de sinais impulsivos e objeto de pesquisa corrente. No estado-da-arte, detectores sao construdos a partir de series_temporais de vetores de caractersticas computados a partir de janelas
deslizantes de sinal. Caractersticas extradas do sinal de audio incluem a correlacao com um sinal padrao, forma
espectral, analise de transientes, e outras tecnicas adaptadas da literatura em processamento_de_sinais de voz,
como coeficientes mel-cepstrais e de codificacao linear. O trabalho aqui apresentado propoe novas caractersticas
para detectores de sinais impulsivos, a tais caractersticas podem ser derivadas especificamente quando o sinal e
gravado por um arranjo de sensores, ja que elas sao baseadas na direcao_de_incidencia de energia vibracional. Na
ocorrencia de sinais impulsivos, ha uma alta incidencia de energia a partir de uma direcao especfica, e que dura
por apenas um breve intervalo de tempo. Na literatura, sistemas que se interessam pela direcao-de-incidencia so
calculam tal direcao condicionalmente a deteccao do sinal. Aqui, ao contrario, o que se propoe e que se avalie a
direcao-de-incidencia continuamente, e que caractersticas relacionadas as direcoes de incidencia sejam utilizadas
em serie_temporal com finalidade de deteccao_de_sinal. A direcao_de_incidencia ainda pode ser usada para conformacao_de_feixes a fim de que caractersticas tradicionalmente derivadas de sensores unicos sejam derivadas a
partir do sinal recuperado na direcao estimada. Exemplos tpicos de sinais impulsivos sao os sons de disparos de
armas de fogo, explosoes, quebra de vidro, colisoes de carro, e trovoadas. Sinais impulsivos tambem ocorrem na
biologia, como cliques de baleias, batimentos cardacos, e potenciais de acao.

. Two primary DOA features are
suggested the estimated DOAs themselves and
their respective reliabilities. DOA estimation is
subject to measurement errors, however the reliability of each DOA estimate may be estimated
as well. This paper suggests the use of LeastSquares (LS), Time-Dierence of Arrival (TDOA)
solutions to the DOA problem (Freire, 2014 ?),
whose reliabilities may be estimated as the LS
cost LS of the solution which compares Time Delay Estimates (TDEs), to the TDOAs predicted
for the respetive microphone pairs, according to
the estimated DOA. The LS cost LS is detailed
in (Freire, 2014). From the primary DOA timeseries, the dierential DOA time-series may be
derived as the three-dimensional angle between
two consecutive DOA estimates. The idea underlying the use of time-series of DOA features for
detection of impulsive signals is that an impulsive
signal makes vibrational energy reach the sensor

Introduction

Detection of impulsive signals (Dufaux, 2001) is an
active area of research in signal processing, with
applications to surveillance against nuclear tests
(Szurbela and Olson, 2004) and to gunshot detection tasks (Lopatka and Czyzewski, 2013 Ahmed
et al., 2013 Shelton, 2013 Dibazar, Bangalore,
Park, George, Yamada and Berger, 2006 Dibazar,
Park, Yamada and Berger, 2006 Makinen and
Pertila, 2010 Freire and Apolinario, 2010 Duckworth et al., 2001 Barger et al., 2010 Barger
et al., 2006 Barger, 2007 Rhudy, 2010 Bucci,
2008), including systems specically designed for
wildlife protection against hunters (GonzalezCastano et al., 2009).
This paper proposes the use of time-series of
direction-of-arrival (DOA) features for detection
of impulsive signals. The running audio is divided
into sliding windows, and a time-series of feature

array from a well-dened direction, and lasts only
for a short duration. Thus, an impulsive signal is
characterized by a short burst of low LS and low
DOA.
A dierence between the state-of-the art and
the invention described here is that, in the stateof-the-art, when there is an interest in information
about the DOA of the impulsive signal, the stage
of DOA estimation conditionally follows detection
of the signal, as in the systems for sniper localization of Makinen and Pertila (2010) and Prandel
et al. (2012). In the present proposal, contrarily,
the DOA features are constantly evaluated, and
used themselves for the detection of impulsive signals.
The features hereby presented could be integrated in systems as the supercomputing cluster for sound event recognition of Lopatka and
Czyzewski (2013), which aims at fast recognition
of hazardous sound events, including classes of impulsive signals as explosions, gunshots, and breaking glass. One algorithm executed by the their
cluster is classication by Support Vector Machine
(SVM) (Vapnik, 1995 Burges, 1998), in which a
decision is made for each sliding short-time frame
of acquired signal a feature vector is derived
from each frame, and 50 features are described
therein, which include Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coecients (MFCC) (Mermelstein, 1976), three
types of temporal features, including transient features, and spectral shape features, all of which are
detailed in their paper. The integration, by the
powerful machine learning algorithm which SVM
is, of diverse features which have been cited before
as useful for detection of impulsive sound events,
makes (Lopatka and Czyzewski, 2013) an integrative recent reference on the subject.
In other systems for detection of impulsive
signals, no citation of the use of DOA features
for the detection stage was found (Duckworth
et al., 2001 Barger et al., 2010 Barger et al.,
2006 Barger, 2007). In (Barger et al., 2006), for
example, a ballistic shockwave is detected by comparison of the maximum amplitude of the signal
against a threshold value, and when this threshold value is exceeded, the abruptness of the transition to this peak value is calculated, and the
condition preceding such transition is evaluated as
well, to assure that in the preceding instant there
was not a peak with signicative amplitude. In
(Barger, 2007) a special acoustic pressure sensor
is used, which was designed to act like a high-pass
lter, detecting high amplitudes caused by oscillations in high frequencies.
In Section 2, a system architecture for impulsive signal detection is designed. In Section 3, use
of DOA features for impulsive signal detection is
illustrated in simulations, then in Section 4, the
prospective performance of the methods is evaluated.

Architecture

A description of the application of DOA features
to detection of impulsive signals in shown in Figure 1. The signal must be acquired by a sensor
array. The integration of conceptually dierent
types of features into a detector is expected to increase detection performance. Methods for DOA
features estimation are detailed in the following
subsections.

Figure 1 Proposal of architecture for impulsive
signal detection by time series of feature vectors.
The improvement yielded by the use of DOA features is shown in gray.

2.1

Estimation of direction-of-arrival features

The DOA features should be estimated by
LS-TDOA methods (Smith and Abel, 1987)
with Time Delay Estimates (TDEs) given
by Knapp and Carter (1976)s Generalized
Cross-Correlation (GCC) with Phase Transform
(PHAT) weights. Such methods are advocated for
DOA estimation of impulsive, wide-band signals
(Szurbela and Olson, 2004), and have been successfully applied to DOA estimation of gunshots
(Freire and Apolinario, 2011). Their objective is
to nd a DOA, hereby represented by a, , the
unit vector in the direction given by azimuth 
and grazing angle , that minimizes the cost LS
yielded by the comparison of the parameterized
TDOAs between sensors i and j, where TDOA is
a function of a, , to their respective, measured,
TDEs xixj , where TDEs are estimated from the

150

GCC-PHAT of the acquired signals xi and xj . The
(unweighted) cost LS of the DOA estimate a,
is dened as

LS (a, ) 

1 X

(xi xj  pT
ij a, ) ,
Np i,j

2.3

A beamformer (Van Veen and Buckley, 1988) can
be used, to minimize eects of noise, echoes,
and reverberation once there is an estimation of
a possible DOA of a possibly occurring impulsive impulsive signal. The use of the signal recovered by the beamformer, instead of a singlemicrophone signal, may increase detection robustness by non-DOA features, as for example, the
correlation against a template used in (Freire and
Apolinario, 2010 Ahmed et al., 2013) for singlemicrophone recordings.
According to Godara (1995), beamforming of
broadband signals may be implemented in the
frequency domain. However, another possibility,
which is easier to implement, is delay-and-sum in
the time domain, by calculating the TDOAs for
pairs of microphones according to the estimated
DOA, then creating delayed versions of the signals which are summed up. Upsampling the signal prior to calculation of delays is recommended,
in order to minimize harmful eects of fractional
delays.

where pij  (pi  pj )c, c is the speed of sound,
pi and pj are the cartesian coordinates of sensors
i and j, and Np is the number of pairs of sensors
used in the estimation.
Three LS-TDOA methods are comparatively
evaluated in (Freire, 2014) the classical LSTDOA (RAW) of Smith and Abel (1987), the
Weighted Least-Squares of Varma et al. (2002)
and the Iterative Least-Squares (ILS) of (Freire
and Apolinario, 2012). Results therein showed
that WLS and ILS are more robust than RAW
against additive uncorrelated ambient noise.
2.2

Beamforming

Robustness against low SNR, echoes and reverberation

One problem often faced by automatic detectors of impulsive signals is decrease in performance due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
Wind often creates too many false positives in
this task (Dibazar, Bangalore, Park, George, Yamada and Berger, 2006 Dibazar, Park, Yamada
and Berger, 2006). Long distances between source
and sensor also contribute to lowering the SNR,
and specically for the sniper localization task this
is a critical factor, because the recorded SNR depends on distance between sniper and sensors. In
(Nikolaos, 2010), the decay of sound intensity of a
gunshot was evaluated for distances between 9.6
and 38.4 meters, and it was shown that in such
conditions the inverse square law is followed, with
sound intensity falling on average 5.9904 +- 0.2325
dB for each doubling of distance.
In (Freire and Apolinario, 2010) it was shown
that the maximum correlation of a signal window
against a template of the impulsive signal of interest was more robust against low SNR than a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (Rabiner and Juang,
1986) working on either MFCC or Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) coecients (Itakura, 1975).
Then, in (Ahmed et al., 2013) it was shown that
integration of the maximum correlation against a
template with eighth order LPC coecients as features with a gaussian radial basis function (RBF)
kernel by an SVM classier further increased detection performance.
The DOA features are proposed so as to improve even further the performance of detectors
under low SNR. Especially the DOA features estimated by ILS and WLS are advocated for use in
the detector, because, as shown in (Freire, 2014),
they are more robust against low SNR.

2.4

Computationally efficient estimation of the
correlation function in sliding windows

The computational cost of estimation of DOA
features in sliding windows may be reduced by
making use of the sliding Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) algorithm of Jacobsen and Lyons
(2003) TDOA methods for DOA estimation
rely on computation of the Generalizaed CrossCorrelation Function (GCC) (Knapp and Carter,
1976), which, with PHAT weights (GCC-PHAT)
can be estimated, for frequency-domain signals Xi
and Xj , as

Simulations

In this section, the use of time-series of DOA features for detection of impulsive signals is illustrated with simulations.
The impulsive signal is a time-stretched pulse
(TSP) (Aoshima, 1981 Suzuki et al., 1995), implemented in Matlab c by (Suzuki et al., 1992),
of length 1920 samples and ratio of the swept
sine of 0.005. A sampling rate of 44.1kHz is
dened, and sound speed is 350ms throughout
the simulations. Signal propagation is based on
the paradigm of geometric acoustics (Allen and
Berkley, 1979), implemented as the Image-source
model (ISM) Matlab c toolbox by (Lehmann and

the RAW algorithm is applied to the data in (b)
and the use of the LS cost RAW for detection of
impulsive signals is illustrated.
Figure 5 (a) shows the 7-sensor recordings obtained in a reverberant environment, already embedded in additive ambient noise. It is possible
to count 12 full occurrences of the signal, and one
(last) interrupted occurrence. This may be more
clear in the single-sensor depiction of Figure 2 (b).
Then, in Figure 5 (b), the 12 full occurrences of
the signal are detected by application of the ILS
algorithm to the sliding windows. The LS cost
ILS is depicted. The interrupted occurrence of
the signal has not been detected. In Figure 5 (c)
and (d), the estimated DOA of the signal is shown,
then the dierential series DOA is derived and
shown in Figure 5 (e), in which it is possible to
identify the 5 rst occurrences of the signal (the
direct signal and the four rst reections), plus
2 of the later reections, detecting overall 7 instances.

An array of 7 microphones is created using

where 0, 0, 0 is the center of the array. The use
of a 7-microphone setup is inspired by the system
(Mazurek et al., 2005). The simulated signal arrives at the sensor array from a dened DOA. Uncorrelated noise is added to the signal of each sensor the noise has a power spectral density which
approximates that of an open eld environment,
and is created by passing white noise through a
60-coecient FIR lter, obtained by Wiener ltering.
The choice of length w of the sliding window
is based on the length  of the target signal and
the array dimensions, as illustrated in Figure 3. If
the algorithm requires the full signal to be present
in the window, and the largest distance between
two sensors in the array is L, then w should be
chosen according to
w   + L,

Prospective performance

This section analyses prospective performance for
detection of gunshot audio signals of the LS cost
of DOA estimates LS . In this stage, analyses are
mostly based on simulations. Supplemental analysis is based on real-world data, made up of gunshot audio signals collected by a 7-microphone array at Centro de Avaliacoes do Exercito (CAEx),
and of ambient noise collected during the same
experiments. From Figure 6, it is possible to see
that the LS costs ILS and RAW derived by tentative estimation of DOA from recorded ambient
noise are on the order of magnitude of hundreds
or thousands, which indicate no well-dened DOA
could be found. From Figure 7, it is possible to
see that, in the occurrence of a muzzleblast signal, in those environments, the DOA estimated
by ILS is generally on the order of magnitude of

(3)

which for the parameters in the simulation lead
to w  39 samples, so sliding windows are created with a 50-sample window and 1-sample sliding step.
In the results of DOA estimation of simulation data that follow, the algorithms used are either RAW or ILS. When the LS cost LS , or the
dierential DOA are shown, multiplicative inversion is used so as to make the image more clear
to human appreciation. The objetive here is to
illustrate the principles, and not to compare the
performance of the algorithms.

the iteration of DOA estimation through removal
of microphone pairs), and the DOA estimated by
RAW is generally on the order of magnitude of
tens (it is the DOA estimated by all pairs in the
array, that is, 21 pairs). From these data, the LS
cost of recorded noise is one or two orders of magnitude above the LS cost of windows containing
muzzleblast signals, indicating that time-series of
LS cost of sliding signal windows could be integrated into detectors of impulsive signals. More
extensive testing will be performed on the CAEx
database (Instituto Militar de Engenharia, 2012).

Two DOA features were evaluated the LS cost
