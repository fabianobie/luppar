Abstract In this paper a linear quadratic regulator control is designed to solve the path tracking problem
for a Tiltrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The equations of motion of the vehicle are obtained via EulerLagrange formulation taking into account eight degrees-of-freedom. This model avoids nonlinearities between
the control variables. Furthermore, the UAVs rotors are tilted laterally by a fixed angle, enhancing the systems
controllability. To perform the control design, the system is linearized around a generic trajectory yielding a
linear time varying model. To corroborate the control structure, the controlled system is simulated with a 30
uncertainty of the mass and inertia moments while in a fairly aggressive trajectory with persistent disturbances.

Introduction

stepping control. Backstepping control strategies are also used in (Sanchez et al., 2008)
and (Bhanja Chowdhury et al., 2012). Tiltrotor UAVs have also been controlled by linear
techniques linear model predictive controllers
(Papachristos, Alexis, Nikolakopoulos and Tzes,
2011 Jansen and Ramirez-Serrano, 2011) and
PIDs (Papachristos, Alexis and Tzes, 2011).

The interest in civil unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAV) has increased dramatically over the past
few years. These aircraft systems have brought
forth a large scientific community, for it poses interesting challenges in several different fields, from
real time systems to advanced control.
The development and consolidation of small
scale UAVs were enabled by the several relevant
researches in the subject, the most studied being helicopter-like UAVs (Fujiwara et al., 2004
Kureeemun et al., 2005 Chingozha et al., 2013)
and quadrotors (Bouabdallah et al., 2004 Castillo
et al., 2005 Tayebi and McGilvray, 2006).
Another configuration that has been fairly researched is the tiltrotor. It is basically an aircraft
that can tilt its rotors, therefore having the ability to give a desired direction to the thrust force.
This provides the possibility to not only hover and
perform vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) like
helicopters and quadrotors, but also to perform
airplane-like flights by tilting its rotors horizontally.
One of the first works with a small scale tiltrotor is (Kendoul et al., 2005), where a NewtonEuler modeling is presented with a nonlinear back-

This paper aims to control a tiltrotor UAV being physically built as a part of a research project
named ProVANT. In all cited works, a six degreesof-freedom model is used, where problems with
nonlinearities between the control variables always
arise. In this work, to design the control law
an eight degrees-of-freedom dynamic model obtained via the Euler-Lagrange formulation is used.
This model considers the tilt angles as generalized
coordinates and the nonlinearities between control variables are extinguished. Furthermore, the
UAVs rotors are tilted laterally by a fixed angle,
enhancing the systems controllability, and a displacement of the center of mass in all axis is also
considered.
The main contribution of this work is the design of path tracking control to this novel tiltrotor model. To perform that a linear time vary-

ing model is used to compute a linear quadratic
regulator (LQR) for linear time variant (LTV)
systems. The LQR is widely used to control
quadrotors (Lan et al., 2012 Panomrattanarug
et al., 2013 Reyes-Valeria et al., 2013), mainly for
its innate robustness but even so, applications of
this controller in tiltrotors are still modest.
This paper is structured as follows in Section
2, a brief presentation of the nonlinear model is
made. The nonlinear model is linearized and the
LQR-LTV control design is exposed in Section 3.
In Section 4 the system is simulated to validate the
approach. Finally, the conclusions of the paper are
drawn in Section 5.

The system should be linearized around a
generic state reference vector that follows the desired trajectory (6). When the system is correctly
following the trajectory it will be in steady state
and all other states will be in its equilibrium point
(8).

gains yields that less control effort will be used to
control the system.
The LQR was also chosen for its robust properties, presenting phase margin of at least 60 degrees (Mackenroth, 2004).
Considering a LTI system with a full statefeedback controller

Now it is possible to calculate the control reference input ur (t) by using xr in model (1). This
defines the reference control as

Differentiating the Lyapunov

V (t)  x0 (t)P (t)x(t) + x0 (t)P (t)x + x0 (t)P (t)x(t)

 x0 (t)(A0 P (t) + P (t)A + P (t))x(t)
+ u0 (t)B 0 P (t)x + x(t)0 P (t)Bu(t)

Finally, linearizing the model in equation (7)
yields
x(t)  A(t)x(t) + Bu(t)

(12)
As the system is time invariant, then P (t) 
P and P (t) is zero. Now assuming that controller K stabilizes the closed loop system, then

Since matrix A varies in time with the acceleration of the trajectory (xr , yr , zr , r ), the system
is represented by the time varying linear model
(9).
The state-space model is augmented with an
integral action for each element of the trajectory,
which improves the closed loop system performance and allows persistent disturbance rejection.

For such a complex model, classical control techniques may not work as expected. The presence
of system zeros and the high coupling between the
states makes a system much less intuitive to control with, for example, pole placement techniques.
As a better approach, the aim can be to minimize a cost function that represents the closed

that weights the statess energy and the control

where P > 0 is the solution for matrices Q and
R chosen positive definite, which in turn assure
that V < 0 and that the system is asymptotically
stable.
The controller design of the LQR controller
boils down to defining matrices Q and R. To assign values to matrix Q, it is important to have
in mind that, even though the tiltrotor system is
represented trough a single matrix, the tiltrotor
has three subsystems, namely servomotors subsystem, attitude subsystem and position subsystem.
The main idea is to make the servomotors
states have the fastest dynamics, followed by the
attitude and the position being the slower ones.
As each subsystem has different units and
ranges, its values are scaled using Brysons law
(Johnson and Grimble, 1987). The results are

A(t) online. This way, a different set of LTI matrices for each time instant and the instant gain
matrix K for each particular set can be computed
with its ARE, in the the same manner as in section
(3.2).
If the cost computational of the ARE is too
high for the embedded system used, one can consider to calculate all the gain matrices beforehand.
This is possible if all the trajectories are known
before the aircraft takes flight, since the trajectorys accelerations are the single requirement to
compute matrix A(t) at a given time. Therefore,
the gain matrices can be computed offline for each
time interval of the trajectory.

where Q is a 20x20 diagonal matrix and the elements in its diagonal are Qdiag .
This controller is appropriate for simple trajectories like constant values and ramps, as its accelerations are equal to zero and the time varying
model (9) actually becomes time invariant.
Nevertheless, for more complex trajectories
it will not use the acceleration informations that
could lead it to a better path tracking.

LQR control for linear time varying systems
For the model parameters presented in Table
1, the equilibrium point is (considering r (t)  0)

The LQR considering the time varying system (9)
with a state feedback controller can be calculated
in different ways, the most common being (i)
through the Ricatti Differential Equation (RDE)
(ii) through calculation of the corresponding ARE
for each time instant.
The first method can be deduced from realizing that in equation (12), P (t) is not equal to
zero in the LTV case. With the same manipulations it is easy to arrive in the RDE. The use
of such method should be made with care as to
respect its existence conditions (Ledyaev, 2011).
The results in this paper uses the second
method, which can only be applied because all
time variant variables of the system are known at
any instant of time, allowing to compute matrix

((t), (t), R (t), L (t)) 
(0.0201, 8.9752, 8.9358, 8.9466).102
and q  0.
Saturation on control signals are considered,
being the thrust forces constrained in 0, 15N and
the servo torques in 2, 2N.m, in accordance
with the corresponding actuators specifications.

Figures 2 to 6 show the closed loop systems

taken in account all aspects enumerated. The
path is followed even though every five seconds
some abrupt change in the trajectory or a disturbance takes place.
Figure 3 shows the four states that have integral action (except for scenario 3). The controller tracks the desired path even with the uncertainties. After 5 seconds, when the persistent
disturbances start, scenario 3 drifts a little off the
path, for it cannot fully reject the disturbances,
although only the yaw angle has a significant error.
The control input varies a bit intensively, but
that is expected due to the abrupt transitions in
the trajectory. It can observed fast dynamics from
the actuators, but they are feasible for most modern brushless motors and servomotors.

ease the adaptation for a tiltrotor with different

A fairly aggressive environment was simulated with Simulink, where parameter uncertainties, persistent disturbances and a compound trajectory with abrupt transitions are considered for
three different scenarios.
The LQR controller showed robustness and a
good disturbance rejection while successfully accomplishing the goal of path tracking.
For future work, it is aimed to implement the
developed controller in the physical UAV that is
currently being built as part of project ProVANT.
