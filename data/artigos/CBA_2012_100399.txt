Abstract This paper proposes a sliding mode power control for doubly-fed induction generators using Sliding
Mode Controllers (SMC), applying stator-flux-oriented vector control in order to decouple the active and reactive
power generated. The sliding mode control has simple implementation and a better response when compared to
the PI controllers. Simulation results with the proposed control scheme are presented, along with a comparative
simulation of the SMC versus PI control.

Introduction

The renewable energy systems have attracted
interest due to the increasing concern about the
emission of carbon dioxide and other poluent
gases. From the many options of renewable
sources, one which has obtained and will continue
to obtain a great attention is the wind energy.
Doubly-fed induction machine based wind turbines have been one of the most emergent
technologies for this kind of electric energy
generation, since this kind of assynchronous
machine is a cost effective, efficient and reliable
solution (Abad et al., 2011). The typical topology
of a DFIG based wind turbine connected to the
grid is shown on Figure 1.
The generators stator can be connected
directly to the grid, from which mostly of the
generated power is delivered to the grid. The
rotor is conected to a bidirectional converter that
is connected to the grid. This converter controls
the rotor voltage (thus, the generated energy)
and the connection with the grid (Baroudi
et al., 2007).
The control of the wind turbine system can
be based on either stator-flux-oriented vector
control (Tapia et al., 2003) or stator-voltageoriented vector control (Shen and Ooi, 2005).

to the grid.

The scheme decouples the rotor current into
active and reactive power components and, with
a rotor current controller, the power control
is achieved. Some investigations using PI controllers that create rotor current references to the
inverter from active and reactive power errors
or in-series-PI controllers that results in rotor
voltage references have been presented by (Tapia
et al., 2003 Chowdhury and Chellapilla, 2006).
The problems in using PI controllers are the
tunning, the cross-coupling of DFIG terms and
its slow response.
The Sliding Mode Control strategy is a
variable structure control method.

alternative to the classic control theory for a
noncontinuous control implemetation (Edwards
and Spurgeon, 1998). This kind of control has a
switching characteristic, which becomes an interesting process when applied to switching power
converters (Rashid, 2004), and has been studied
along with anothers DFIG power regulation
or torque regulation techniques, such as direct
torque control (DTC) (Chen et al., 2011 Lascu
et al., 2004), direct power control (DPC) (Hu
et al., 2010 Jeong et al., 2008) and a cutting-in
no-load application for field oriented control
(FOC) (Zheng et al., 2010). However, many of
these techniques present variable switching frequency (which complicates the AC filter design),
current distortion or they are very dependent on
the machine parameters.
This paper proposes an alternative power control scheme for DFIG using Sliding Mode Controllers with stator-flux-oriented vector control.
Simulation results are presented to validate the
proposed control scheme and to compare the results with the PI control scheme.

The proposed power control aims independent stator active P and reactive Q power control
by means of a rotor current regulation. For this
purpose, P and Q are represented as functions
of each individual rotor current. To achieve this
objective, the stator-flux-oriented vector control

With the rotor currents, it is possible to calculate the stator currents and active and reactive
power. Consequently, this principle can be used
on stator active and reactive power control by
regulating the currents in the rotor side with the
generators stator terminals connected directly to
the grid.

SMC applied to the DFIG power
control

The essential idea of traditional VSC control
algorithms is to enforce the system mode to slide
along a predefined sliding surface of the system
state space (Edwards and Spurgeon, 1998). Once
the state of the system reaches the sliding surface,
the structure of the controller is adaptively
changed to slide the state of the system along
the sliding surface. Hence, the system response
depends only on the predefined sliding surface
and remains insensitive to variations of system
parameters and external disturbances. However,
such insensitivity property is not guaranteed
before sliding mode occurs, resulting in the loss
of the robustness during the reaching phase.
Furthermore, in order to reduce the chattering,
the sign function of VSC is often replaced by

saturation function in practical implementations (Lazarini and Filho, 2008).
In (Lascu et al., 2004) was proposed a
sliding mode approach for direct torque control of sensorless induction motor drives and,
in (Filho et al., 2011), was proposed controllers
for field orientation control (FOC) based on the
dynamic modeling of the DFIG. This proposed
strategy uses the sliding mode controller and the
stator-flux-oriented control to regulate the rotor
currents and the active and reactive power based
on (9) and (10).

where ci2d and ci2q are constants defined taking into account the desirable dynamic response
for the system.
According to the Equations (13) and (14),
the rotor current d component is responsible
for the reactive power control and, the rotor
current q component, is reponsible for the active
power control. This way, the control objetive is
to make the system state go to the equilibrium
point defined on the origin of the sliding surface
(S  0), where the errors and their derivatives
are zero, ensuring that the states reach their
references.
Based on (Lascu et al., 2004), for active and
reactive power control by regulating rotor currents, voltages are applied to the rotor being used
as control signals. Their references are calculated
by the control algorithm and are given by

where KP i2d and KP i2q are the proportional

as for a PI controller, v2dref and v2qref are rotor
voltage references on dq reference frame and
eval(s1 ) and eval(s2 ) are evaluation functions
that determine the switching behavior of the controller once the responses reach the sliding surface.
The eval function can be simple as the signal function. However, in this case, it was used a

where n can be 1 or 2, depending on the

This way, control algorithm creates rotor voltage references that allows the active and reactive
power to converge to their respective reference values. The desired rotor voltage in the rotor reference frame (r ) that generates switching signals
for the rotor side converter using, for example,
space_vector modulation, is given by
v2r  v2dq es r

(19)

where s is the stator flux angle and r is the
rotor electric angle.
The block diagram of the proposed control
scheme is shown in Figure 2.

Variable Speed Operation

During this test, the generator was driven with
a speed profile shown in Figure 6, which varies
from 132,216 rads (subsynchronous) to 226,656
(supersynchronous) and it was tested with various active and reactive power steps as set points
to test the dynamic response of the control strategy, shown in Figure 7. The initial active power
and the power factor references were, respectively,
-120kW and +1. The active power and the power
factor references were changed from -120kW to 60kW and from +1 to +0.85 at 3s, respectively.
Then, at 3.25s, the power reference was changed
again from -60kW to -100kW and, the power factor, from +0.85 to -0.85. Finally, at 3.5s, the
power reference was changed again from -100kW
to -120kW and, the power factor, from -0.85 to
+1. In the Figures 8 and 9 are shown the rotor
currents and the phase a stator current and voltage during this test.

Constant Speed Operation

First, the generator was driven in a constant speed
of 226,2 rads (120 of the machines synchronous
speed) and it was tested with various active and
reactive power steps as set points to test the dynamic response of the control strategy, as shown in
Figure 3. The initial active power and the power
factor references were, respectivelly, -120kW and
+1. The active power and the power factor references were changed from -120kW to -60kW and
from +1 to +0.85 at 3s, respectively. Then, at
3.25s, the active power reference was changed
from -60kW to -100kW and, the power factor,
from +0.85 to -0.85. Finally, at 3.5s, the power
reference was changed again from -100kW to 120kW and, the power factor, from -0.85 to +1.

Conclusions

This paper proposed a sliding mode control applied to the DFIG power control. Simulation results showed satisfactory performance of the controller during several step response tests, both at
constant and variable rotor speeds and when compared with PI control.
The SMC was compared with the traditional PI
control during the constant speed test and showed
a better response, with minor steady state error
and overshoot. Also, the controllers were tested
with parametric variations to ensure robustness,
where the SMC showed a much better response.
Hence, the SMC strategy can be an interesting
tool for the power control of the DFIG.
