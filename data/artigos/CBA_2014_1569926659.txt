Abstract Support vector machines (SVMs) are an attractive option for detecting incorrect measurements
in continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMSs), because their learning mechanism usually considers a small
subset of patterns to separate failure from fault-free situations. However, standard SVM is inherently biased
towards the majority class when classifying imbalanced datasets. This work is aimed to introduce two SVMs
post-processing strategies for imbalanced datasets applying them to improve the reliability of CGMSs. The first
approach, called SVM-1, considers improving the geometric mean between specificity and sensitivity. In the
second approach, called SVM-2, the priority is to improve sensitivity rather than improving the accuracy of the
overall classifier. To test these approaches, a dataset of 537 samples was obtained (372 correct and 165 incorrect
measurements classified according to International Standards Organization (ISO) criteria) from 23 critically-ill
patients receiving insulin therapy and monitoring over 72 h using a CGMS. The results obtained have shown
that new approaches of SVMs are a potential tool to improve the reliability of CGMSs.

main goal of CGMS is to estimate blood glucose
(BG) concentrations continuously over time (between one to five minutes) to provide detailed realtime information about glucose variability direction, magnitude, duration, and frequency of
hypo- or hyper-glycemia. This information permits to identify the glucose trends throughout the
day, and facilitate in detecting critical glycemic
episodes (hypo- and hyper-glycemia). The main
advantages of CGMS have been demonstrated

Introduction

Continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS)
are devices capable of continuously estimating the
glucose concentration in interstitial fluid. In recent years, there has been an unprecedented technological progress in the development of CGMS,
which constitute a field of work of great importance inside of the technological research line that
seeks to improve the quality of life in millions of
diabetic, and reduce their financial burden. The

in multiple clinical studies a better glycemic
control, reduction of hypo- and hyper-glycemic
episodes and reduced HbA1c . Besides, CGMS is
being a key element in the development of the socalled artificial pancreas (AP) (Bequette, 2012),
a close-loop system which are integrated a CGMS
device, an insulin pump and an algorithm for automatic control of glucose.
In intensive care units (ICUs), BG monitoring is done intermittently using different selfmonitoring of blood glucose (SMBGs), which imposes an additional burden on the ICU staff.
CGMSs allow for better control of glycemia by
identifying real-time fluctuations in BG, permitting the staff to anticipate episodes of hypoand hyper-glycemia, potentially with fewer manual measurements. However, the performance of
CGMS is still suboptimal in terms of accuracy, reliability and robustness against possible failures,
and this can significantly limit their use as a replacement for traditional SMBGs. Thus, improvement of the accuracy, reliability and robustness of
these devices is essential.
The issue of reliability has not been addressed
yet, being the current version of CGMSs still not
able to detect and compensate for failures that can
corrupt the local reliability of the CGMS trace.
The glucose estimations are unreliable, particularly in the hypoglycemic range (Luijf et al., 2013),
in comparison with SMBG measurements and laboratory systems. In order to improve reliability, self-monitoring capabilities must be embedded in the CGMS for detecting abrupt faults.
As only a limited number of works about fault
detection methods for CGMSs have been published to improve the reliability of these devices
(Ward et al., 2004 Bondia et al., 2008 Facchinetti
et al., 2011 Signal et al., 2012 Leal et al., 2013),
significant progress needs to be made in CGMS
fault detection (Bequette, 2010).
Support vector machines (SVMs) are learning machines that implement the structural risk
minimization inductive principle to obtain generalization on a limited number of learning patterns
(Vapnik, 1998). Thus, SVMs are an attractive
option for detecting correct and incorrect measurements made by CGMS, because their learning
mechanism usually considers a small subset of patterns to separate failure from fault-free situations.
Recently, standard SVMs have been used for the
detection of therapeutically correct and incorrect
measurements made by the CGMS Goldr , according to the clinical criteria (Bondia et al., 2008),
to make clinical decisions. However, in CGMS
fault detection, there are many examples of correct measurements and a few examples of incorrect measurements, i.e. the number of bad data is
limited. Thus, in the context of this problem, it
is very important to obtain models that exhibit
a high prediction performance on the minority

class, because it usually represents the target of
the clinical practice, especially whenever the incorrect measurements made by the CGMS correspond to the moment when a patient showed high
glycemic instability (hypo- and hyper-glycemia).
However, standard SVM is inherently biased towards the majority class when classifying imbalanced datasets (Gonzalez-Abril et al., 2014), a
premise not considered in (Bondia et al., 2008).
This work is aimed to introduce two
SVMs post-processing strategies for imbalanced
datasets. The first approach, called SVM-1, considers improving the geometric mean (Gmean ) between specificity and sensitivity. In the second approach, called SVM-2, the priority is to improve
the sensitivity rather than improving the specificity of the overall classifier. To distinguish between correct and incorrect measurements, new
SVMs are trained using the data provided by
a CGMS (electrical signal and glucose estimation) and insulin dose. The readings provided
by the monitor have been previously classified according to a numerical accuracy criteria (International Standards Organization ISO criteria)
(ISO, 2003).
The remainder of this paper is organized as
follows Section 2 describes the SVMs, the metrics commonly employed in the classification problems, and the methodology developed using SVMs
post-processing strategies. Section 3 describes the
clinical experimental setup, and the transformation of the CGMS fault detection problem into a
bi-classification problem. Finally, Sections 4 and
5 report the results and conclusions, respectively.

Support Vector Machines

The standard SVM

Let Z  (x1 , y1 ), . . . , (xN , yN ) be a training set
with xi  X as the input space, yi  +1, 1
as the output space, and zi  (xi , yi ). Let  
X  F, x  (x) be a feature mapping with a dot
product denoted by h, i. A binary linear classifier
f  X  R, defined as f (x)  hx, wi  b, is sought
where w  F, b  R. Outputs are obtained as
h(x)  sign(f (x)).
The standard SVM leads to the optimization

where w defines the orientation of the classifier,

i measure the error on the instances. The userdefined parameter C is such that if the value of C
is higher, then the focus of the SVM on minimizing

the errors will be greater.
P The solution of (1) can be expressed as w0 
i i yi xi , where i are the Lagrange multipliers
for dual formulation. Term b is calculated a posteriori (Gonzalez-Abril et al., 2008), which is denoted as b0 (standard bias). Finally, the classifier
PN
can be written as f (x)  i1 i yi K(xi , x)b0 
hx, w0 i  b0 where K  X  X  R, defined as
K(x, y)  hx, yi  h(x), (y)i, is called the kernel function.
This theory was developed on the basis of a
separable binary classification problem where the
optimization criterion is the width of the margin between the positive and negative examples
(Gonzalez-Abril et al., 2005), which provides a
good generalization performance (Cristianini and
Shawe-Taylor, 2000). However, standard SVMs
aim to minimize the error on the entire dataset,
and hence, are inherently biased toward the majority class when classifying imbalanced datasets
(Gonzalez-Abril et al., 2014).
2.2

i.e. Sensitivity is the proportion of positive
cases correctly identified, while Specif icity is the
fraction of true negatives among all negative instances. Hence, a measure that is more sensitive to the low positive values and that combines
Sensitivity and Specif icity is Gmean , which is
defined as their geometric mean
s
tpos  tneg
(2)
Gmean (f, D) 
Npos  Nneg
where both positive and negative classes have the
same relevance for the purpose of classification.
2.3

This post-processing strategy is based on the consideration that the bias b is a parameter to be
tuned. The function learned by a standard SVM
will be adjusted through the bias to improve its
performance, measured in terms of the Gmean (2).
Hence, once the solution vector w0 of the
problem (1) is obtained, the set of classifiers
F (w0 ) is considered

Starting from w0 , the SVM-1 classifier is defined
by modifying the standard bias b. The SVM1 classifier bG (x) is defined, using the classifier
fbG (x)  F(w0 ), such that given an input vector
x, it assigns a label as follows

+1 if hx, w0 i  bG
bG (x)  sign(fbG (x)) 
1 if hx, w0 i < bG

Let Zpos  zi  Zyi  +1 and Zneg 
zi  Zyi  1 be the sets of training patterns
for the positive and negative class, respectively.
Let Npos  Zpos and Nneg  Zneg be the
numbers of positive and negative instances, respectively hence, N  Npos + Nneg .

According to the previous theoretical results,

Based on the Table 1, Accuracy of the classifier f (x) on a test set D is defined as
Accuracy(f, D) 

i.e. Accuracy is a metric computing the proportion of instances that are correctly classified by the
model. However, when probabilities for both the
classes greatly differ, Accuracy is very sensitive to
changes in the data and is biased toward the most
probable class (He and Garcia, 2009). Therefore,
other assessment measures must be considered.
One possibility is to consider the Sensitivity and
Specif icity metrics, which are defined as

The SVM-2 A post-processing strategy to
tune the bias b in function of the sensitivity

Within the set of classifiers F (w0 ) (3), a trade-off
should be found between Sensitivity (b), a decreasing function of b, and Specificity(b), an increasing
function of b, in order to maximize generalization.
One way to circumvent this problem given the set
of classifiers F (w0 ), is to fix a threshold 0  r  1
such that Sensitivity (b)  r, in order to guarantee a minimum true positive rate in the positive
class and to maximize the Specificity(b). Hence,
the following problem is considered

stabilized, the ABG measurements were recorded
every 1, 2, 3 h, and then every 4 h. If the
patients nutritional intake was stopped for any
reason, then the glycemic control testing was
performed more frequently, even during normoglycemia. Additional ABG measurements were
used for RTCGMS calibration. From the 23 patients, 537 ABG readings were obtained, excluding those readings used for calibration.
Under continuous glucose monitoring, the
dose of CII (Insulin) was recorded. The ABG
samples were used by the nurses to administer
insulin therapy, according to the protocol established by the ICU. A CII was started once the patient exhibited ABG values >150 mgdL to maintain the ABG level between 120 and 160 mgdL.
Short-acting insulin (Actrapidr , Novo Nordisk,
Bagsvaerd, Denmark) diluted in 0.9 saline was
used. CII was stopped when the ABG was <110
mgdL. Insulin was recorded at the same time as
ABG.
The septic status of the patient was recorded
every 24 h by the patients medical team, and was
classified based on (Lorencio et al., 2012) in three
groups patients with septic shock, patients with
sepsis, and patients without sepsis.

Data labeling and processing

The ISO criteria (ISO, 2003), an analytical accuracy method currently accepted by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) to assess the accuracy of CGMS devices is considered as the standard method to define the classification scheme
associated with correct and incorrect measurements. The ISO criteria include the percentage of
GRT CGMS readings within 15 mgdL of the ABG
readings, when the ABG reading is 75 mgdL,
or within 20.0 of the ABG readings, when the
ABG reading is >75 mgdL.
The ABG measurements were synchronized
with Insulin measurements.
Furthermore,
the ABG and RTCGMS readings (Isig and
GRT CGMS ) were obtained at different times. Subsequently, the RTCGMS readings were matched to
the reference ABG within  2.5 min. The dataset
of paired values (ABG  GRT CGMS ) was first classified using the ISO criteria with ABG measurements as the gold standard. Then, the data distribution was performed according to the following
bi-classification scheme
Class -1 (minus one) The measurements that
fulfilled the ISO criteria were considered as correct
measurements. Of the whole dataset, 69.3 (372
samples) comprised correct data items.
Class 1 (one) The measurements that did not
fulfill the ISO criteria were considered as incorrect
measurements. Of the whole dataset, 30.7 (165
samples) comprised incorrect data items.
Consequently, the dataset contained 537 sam-

Data are median values. Numbers in parentheses indicate
the interquartile range (Q1Q3, respectively).
a These values correspond to the initial condition.

Patients were monitored for 72 h using
the Guardianr real-time CGMS (RTCGMS)
(Medtronic, Northridge, CA). This device consists
of a disposable subcutaneous needle-type SOFsensor and an external monitor. The sensor is an
amperometric system that uses glucose oxidase,
which generates an electrical signal (Isig) proportional to the glucose concentration in the interstitial fluid (GRT CGMS ). The sensor estimates
GRT CGMS at 5-min intervals. So, data provided
by the RTCGMS itself corresponded to (Isig)
measured in nanoamperes and to (GRT CGMS )
measured in mgdL. Calibrations were performed
according to the RTCGMS manufacturers instructions (three to four per day).
Arterial blood glucose (ABG) readings are
used as the gold standard to define the classes
into the bi-classification problem using ISO criteria. In the present study, ABG was measured
using the whole BG concentration reported by the
HemoCuer 201 DM system (HemoCue AB, Angelholm, Sweden). When a patient showed high
glycemic instability, ABG samples were taken every 30 min. Then, once the glycemic values were

0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95, 0.99. Thus, for each
r value, a total of 7500 problems were solved. Similarly, SVMs-2-RBF were tuned considering 132
possible combinations between the value of C and
 explored on a two-dimensional grid C  24 ,
23 ... 26 , 27  and   23 ...26 , 27 . The threshold r was fixed considering seven possible values
indicated previously. Thus, for each r value, a total of 16500 problems were solved. All models obtained from each combination of parameters were
validated using their corresponding validation set.

Detection of correct and incorrect measurements in CGMSs by applying post-processing
SVMs

To evaluate the performance of the postprocessing strategies SVM-1 and SVM-2, a leavethree-out cross-validation strategy was used, i.e.
patients data were partitioned into two sets a
training set (20 patients) and a testing set (the
three remaining patients). First, different classifiers SVM-1 and SVM-2 were trained. The training set considered the feature vector X  (Isig,
GRT CGMS , Insulin) as the input. The feature
vector was autoscaled to have zero mean and unity
variance to prevent problems with outliers. Then,
model parameters were tuned from the training
set previously autoscaled. Second, the classifiers
were used to indicate the behavior of the other
three patients not included in the training set
(testing data). Thus, the testing data were autoscaled accordingly using the mean and standard
deviation obtained from the training set.
The above-mentioned methodology was repeated for different data partitions, i.e. combinations of 20-3 patients (eight partitions in total). In each partition, different classifiers SVMs1 and SVM-2s using polynomial kernel (SVM-1Poly and SVM-2-Poly) and radial basis function
kernel (SVM-1-RBF and SVM-2-RBF) were tuned
and validated. The criterion employed to estimate the performance generalized in the SVMs1 and SVMs-2 was the five-fold cross-validation
on the entire training set, and this procedure was
repeated 25 times to ensure good statistical behavior.
In the case of SVMs-1, SVMs-1-Poly were
tuned considering 60 possible combinations between the value of C (regularization term)
and d (degree polynomial) explored on a twodimensional grid C  24 , 23 ... 26 , 27  and
d polynomial  1, 2 ...5. Thus, a total of 7500
problems were solved. Similarly, SVMs-1-RBF
were tuned considering 132 possible combinations
between the value of C and  (RBF width) explored on a two-dimensional grid C  24 , 23
... 26 , 27  and   23 ...26 , 27 . Thus, a total
of 16500 problems were solved. All models obtained from each combination of parameters were
validated using their corresponding validation set.
In the case of SVMs-2, SVMs-2-Poly were
tuned considering 60 possible combinations between the value of C and d explored on a twodimensional grid C  24 , 23 ... 26 , 27  and
d polynomial  1, 2 ...5. In order to guarantee a maxim true positive rate (Sensitivity (b))
 r), the threshold r was fixed as follows r

Results

First, a comparative analysis between different approaches of SVMs (standard SVMs, SVMs-1 and
SVMs-2) was carried out. The results are shown
in Table 3.
Standard SVM reported the best values of Accuracy and Specificity in comparison with SVM-1
and SVM-2. However, it also reported the worst
values of Sensitivity. Sensitivity to low values implies the presence of false negatives. False negatives lead to the ICU staff to modify the dose of
CII, which would have a significant clinical impact
with regard to the administration of insulin therapy to the patient, because these misclassifications
would result in inappropriate treatment.
Although SVM-1 presented a lower Accuracy
than standard SVM, it was found to have a better Sensitivity, which is the priority in the CGMS
fault detection problem. As mentioned earlier,
this is because the SVM-1 is based on Gmean ,
which considers both positive and negative classes
to be equally relevant for the purpose of classification, balancing the performance between Sensitivity and Specificity.
The SVM-2 improved significantly the Sensitivity regarding to the standard SVM. In contrast, SVM-2 presented Specificity to low values,
which implied a significant number of false positives. The presence of false positives may not
have clinical consequences for patients, because
they do not lead to the ICU staff modifying the insulin therapy. However, false positives lead to the
ICU staff taking measurements of ABG more frequently to ensure patient safety, which is contrary
to one of the main benefits of using the CGMS in
the ICU, to avoid the frequent and painful punctures. To maximize the Specificity and to maintain good Sensitivity, the optimal value to adjust
r was 0.8. This value ensured a Specificity above
50,0 and a good Sensitivity.
The classification results of three representative patients according to the septic status of the
patient are shown in Fig. 1. Those patients were
chosen because they had similar metrics to the average metrics reported for each cohort of patients
depending on the septic status.

the Fig. 1 is that the SVM-1 provided a balanced
and adequate performance for patients with septic shock and with sepsis, but the performance
was poor for the patient without sepsis. Although
the patient without sepsis also reported balanced
performance in its metrics with SVM-1, these values were low to be accepted from a clinical point
of view. On the other hand, when the SVM-2
was applied a significant improvement of the Sensitivity was reported in the three patients, and
the values obtained in this metric were high to
be accepted from a clinical point of view. However, although the SVM-2 guarantees a maximum
rate in the detection of incorrect measurements,
the Specificity values achieved were too low to be
clinically accepted.

case, GRT CGMS was 178 mgdL, while ABG was
109 mgdL. If the physician considered the glucose
measurement indicated by the RTCGMS as reliable, a dose of CII may be started to maintain the
ABG between 120 and 160 mgdL. This decision
may subsequently cause a severe hypoglycemic
event in the patient. Additionally, two relevant hypoglycemic events (ABG below 80 mgdL)
were correctly detected by the classifier. In these
events, while ABG measurements indicated hypoglycemic events, the RTCGMS estimated in the
euglycemic range (GRT CGMS between 80 and 160
mgdL). The correct detection of the second hypoglycemic episode allowed for detecting a measurement of glucose erroneously estimated by the
CGMS (highlighted with a blue dashed circle).
Finally, for the same patient, using a SVM-2Poly (see Fig. 2, lower), it can be noted in the
figure that this patient presented a high Sensitivity (87.5). However, an important number of
false positives were reported in this case (Specificity  43.5). Although false positives do not
have clinical consequences for patients, these misclassifications may lead to the ICU staff to taking uncomfortable and painful punctures of ABG
more frequently to ensure patient safety, increasing the workload of nurses and the risk of accidental punctures.

Let us illustrate the specific case of a patient
with septic shock, using a standard SVM-Poly (see
Fig. 2, upper). This figure shows that the standard SVM was highly specific (91.3). However,
its low Sensitivity (37.5) implies a significant
number of false negatives, which may lead to the
ICU staff to modify the dose of CII. In this particular case, false negatives would have a significant
clinical impact regarding to the administration of
insulin therapy to the patient, which would cause
an inappropriate treatment.
Likewise, for the same patient, using a SVM1-Poly (see Fig. 2, middle), it can be observed in
the figure that this patient presented a good Sensitivity (75.0). Similarly, this patient presented
a slight Specificity (69.6). In this case, three
false hyperglycemic states estimate by CGMS
(GRT CGMS over 160 mgdL when ABG is below
160 mgdL) were correctly detected as incorrect
measurements by the classifier. According to the
physicians opinion, the correct detection of the
second false hyperglycemic episode by the proposed classifier is of great importance. For this

Conclusions

CGMSs are not sufficiently accurate and reliable
at present to be used for therapeutic decisions.
This study has shown that new approaches of
SVMs are a potential tool for developing a selfmonitoring fault detection system from the information provided by the monitor itself and by incorporating the dose of CII.
SVM-1 can be a good alternative for detecting

scribed. These samples should be focused on hypoglycemias due to the importance of the correct
and timely detection of these events. Further research will include a temporal analysis in which
the previous diagnosis is also considered.

correct and incorrect CGMS measurements, because a more balanced performance between Sensitivity and Specificity could be attained owing to
the use of the Gmean metric. The obtained results
can be considered as reliable and promising for
patients with septic shock or sepsis, but cannot
be considered as good for patients without sepsis. This greater reliability in patients with septic
shock and sepsis, could be explained by the increase in capillary permeability observed in these
two cohorts of patients. This increase in capillary
permeability would result in an increase in the diffusion of the intravascular glucose to the interstitial space. Consequently, for these two cohorts of
patients, the information provided by the monitor itself (Isig and GRT CGMS ), which is proportional to the glucose concentration in the interstitial space, would be more reliable. Patients with
septic shock or sepsis are those most frequently admitted to the ICU. In this type of ICU patients,
the glycemic control is often more difficult than in
those without sepsis.
