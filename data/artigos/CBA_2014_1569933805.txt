Abstract This paper addresses the problem of H nonlinear quadratic filter design for nonlinear quadratic discrete-time systems. A matrix inequality condition assuring stability in a local context with an H performance bound for the augmented system,
composed by the quadratic system plus the quadratic filter, is proposed. These properties are certified through the existence of a
constant Lyapunov function satisfying a set of matrix inequalities, that become linear if a scalar variable is fixed. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the superiority, in terms of H performance, of the nonlinear quadratic filters when compared
to standard linear filters.

Resumo Este artigo trata do problema de projeto_de_filtros não_lineares quadráticos para sistemas_não_lineares quadráticos
discretos no tempo. Neste cenário, é proposta uma condição na forma de desigualdade matricial assegurando a estabilidade com
um limitante para o desempenho H para o sistema aumentado, composto pelo sistema quadrático e pelo filtro quadrático, em
um contexto local. Essas propriedades são certificadas por meio da existência de uma função de Lyapunov constante satisfazendo
um conjunto de desigualdades matriciais, que se tornam lineares se uma variável escalar é fixada. Experimentos numéricos são
apresentados para ilustrar a superioridade, em termos de desempenho H , dos filtros quadráticos não_lineares quando comparados
aos filtros lineares convencionais.

et al., 2009 Basin et al., 2010 Li et al., 2012) and for
systems with time-delay (Fridman et al., 2003 Mohammadpour and Grigoriadis, 2008). The H performance is specially useful when there is no information
about the statistics of the exogenous input signal. In
(Liu et al., 2012), the problem of H filter design for
a class of discrete-time chaotic systems is addressed,
and (Li et al., 2012) deals with the H filtering problem for continuous-time polynomial systems through
an iterative algorithm based on SOS.
In this paper the problem of H filtering for nonlinear quadratic discrete-time systems is considered.
The contribution is to extend the results proposed in
(Lacerda et al., 2013) to the discrete-time case. The
proposed method is based on a constant Lyapunov
function and an inequality condition that assures an
H performance bound for the augmented quadratic
system in a local context. By using the Finslers
lemma and imposing structural constraints to the decision variables, quasi-LMI (Linear Matrix Inequality)
conditions with a scalar parameter are proposed for filter design. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the superiority, in terms of H performance,
of the nonlinear quadratic filters when compared to
linear ones.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2
presents the system under consideration and the problem we intend to solve. The main results are developed in Section 3. Section 4 is dedicated to numerical
experiments that illustrate the advantages of the pro-

1 Introduction
Although there has been an increase in the interest
of studying nonlinear problems (Chesi, 2011), there
are several topics that remain as a challenge in the
control literature. In (Amato et al., 2012) sufficient
conditions are proposed to check the stability analysis and guaranteed cost control for nonlinear quadratic
discrete-time systems. However, an initial polytopic
region in the state space must be given. In (Valmorbida
et al., 2012) the problem of synthesis of polynomial
static state feedback laws for systems subject to saturating inputs is investigated by applying sum-ofsquares (SOS) approaches. It is also worth of mention the work in (Coutinho and de Souza, 2013), that
uses recursive algebraic representations to present a
method for the estimation of the domain of attraction for a class of discrete-time nonlinear_systems
subject to uncertain time-invariant parameters. The
class of quadratic systems is one of the most frequently studied in the nonlinear literature, mainly because they can provide better approximations of nonlinear problems than linear systems. Among others,
one may cite (Coutinho and de Souza, 2012), that
studies the problem of state feedback for continuoustime quadratic systems, (Valmórbida et al., 2010) that
presents the problem of state feedback control of saturated quadratic systems, (Amato et al., 2010) that
addresses the output feedback control problem and
(Lacerda et al., 2013) that handles the filtering problem for continuous-time quadratic systems.
Concerning the filtering problem, the H performance criterion is one of the most used. Among

posed method and Section 5 concludes the paper.
Notation. The elements of a matrix A  Rmn are
denoted by A(i, j) , i  1, . . . , m, j  1, . . . , n. A(i) denotes the ith row of matrix A. For two symmetric matrices, A and B, A > B (A  B) means that A B is positive definite (positive semi-definite). For matrices or
vectors ( ) indicates transpose. Matrix He(Z)  Z + Z 
is used to simplify the developments. The blockdiagonal matrix obtained from vectors is expressed by
diag(x1 , . . . , xn ). Similarly, the block-diagonal matrix
obtained from matrices, by diag(X1 , ..., Xn ). 2 represents the Hilbert space of complex signals with finite
energy. Identity matrices are denoted by I and null matrices are denoted by 0. The symbol  means a symmetric block in matrices.

The aim of this paper is to find a full-order quadratic
stable filter described as
 

x fk Aq f 1 x fk
 xf Aq f 2 x fk 
 k

x fk+1  A f x fk + 
 + B f yk

xfk Aq f n f x fk

with n f  n, A f  Rn f n f , Aq f i  Rn f n f , i 
1, . . . , n f , B f  Rn f q , C f  R pn f , D f  R pq ,
x f  Rn f the estimated state and z f  R p the estimated
output.
The quadratic terms in the filter can be interpreted
as a counteraction to the influence of the quadratic
terms of the system.
 Define the augmented state vector xk  xk xfk , the output error ek  zk  z fk and
use definitions (3)(4), which are similarly adaptable
to system (6). Then, the augmented system (1)(6), as
shown in Figure 1, reads

At this stage, it is important to mention that system (7) with wk  0 can be globally asymptotically
stable (i.e., asymptotically stable for any initial condition x0  R2n ) only for some particular structure of
both matrices A and Aq (see, for example, (Koditschek
and Narendra, 1982 Valmórbida et al., 2013) and references therein). Then, the stability of system (7) is
studied in a regional (local) context, requiring that A
is Schur stable. The problem addressed in the paper
can be summarized as follows.

rewrite (14) as

Proposition 1 presents a nonlinear condition because the decision variables of interest (i.e., A f , Aq f ,
B f , C f and D f ) appear in sub-matrices multiplying the
extra variables Fi , i  1, . . . , 4. To linearize the condition presented in Proposition 1, based on the strategies
in (Duan et al., 2006 Lacerda et al., 2011), the following structure imposed on matrices Fi , i  1, . . . , 4,
is considered

Figure 2 shows the H bounds obtained with a linear filter (Aq f  0) and for a nonlinear quadratic filter, obtained through the design conditions of Theorem 1, with parameters   10, b  83,   4 and
t  0.005. The minimum  in this interval is obtained with   0.0970 for both linear and nonlinear
filter. The H bound obtained with the linear filter
is   0.2303 while the nonlinear quadratic filter can
assure   0.1468.

Numerical Experiments

To illustrate the potentialities of the proposed approach, a discrete version of the Lorenz attractor is
used. The conditions presented in this paper depend on scalar parameters  , 1 and 2 that needs
to be searched. In the following experiments a simple linear search with precision 0.001 has been used
in  . Furthermore, free scalars 1 and 2 equal to
zero have been considered with good performance.
Optimization algorithms, as for instance fminsearch
in the optimization toolbox of M ATLAB, could be
used to improve the results. All routines were implemented in Matlab, version 7.11 (R2010b) using
Yalmip (Lfberg, 2004) and SeDuMi (Sturm, 1999).
Consider the Lorenz attractor, a continuoustime nonlinear quadratic system also studied in
(Valmórbida et al., 2010). The discrete version of the
Lorenz model can be obtained from a first order Euler
discretization

5 Conclusion
This paper has investigated the problem of H filter
design for nonlinear quadratic discrete-time systems.
New conditions for stability analysis and filter design
have been proposed. The numerical experiments exhibit the superiority in terms of smaller H bounds of
the nonlinear quadratic filters in comparison with the
linear filters. The extensions to cope with polynomial
systems and H2 filter design are under investigation,
in particular by keeping in mind the more general technique developed in (Valmorbida et al., 2012).

Considering the filter matrices given above, Figure 3
shows the error time response for the augmented system (7), with null initial conditions when the following
exogenous input signal is considered
wk  sin(0.8k) exp(0.02k)
As can be seen, the error time response with the linear
filter (dashed) is greater than the error with a nonlinear quadratic filter (solid), illustrating clearly that the
nonlinear quadratic filter is less conservative.

The evolution of thestates x remains confined in
the region S0  E (P)  x  R2n  x Px  1 for both
linear and nonlinear filter, implying that system (7) is
locally asymptotically stable.
Table 1 presents the minimum H bounds obtained for a linear filter (Aq f  0) and for a nonlinear quadratic filter with the respective values of  , for
several values of  . As can be noted, the nonlinear
quadratic filter can provide better results when compared with the linear filter. Moreover, the bounds are
at least 24 smaller than those achieved with a linear
filter, emphasizing the importance of take into account
the nonlinear term in the filtering problem.
