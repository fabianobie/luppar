Abstract When a power system faces a situation where critical contingencies threat its stability, i.e., the
protective system is not able to prevent the system collapse, the intentional islanding is the last planningcontrol
resource to avoid the total failure of the system. This paper proposes a novel algebraic-graph method, based on
the triangular factorization of the node-branch incidence matrix (branch criticality analysis) and on the weighted
union-find algorithm (regularization procedure of cut-sets), to deal with the intentional islanding problem. The
main features of the proposed method are (i) fast generation of solution candidates (cut-sets) for the desired
island formation, (ii) a fast procedure to regularize a candidate cut-set (in the sense that no more than the
specified number of islands are generated), minimizing the number of elements in the candidate cut-set when
possible.

Introduction

tion problem is usually divided into two distinct
phases. In the rst phase, grouping techniques determine generators (and possible load buses) that
must remain in the same island after the island
formation. Usually coherency based methods are
used in this phase (You et al., 2004), but other
methods are also available, including those based
on control groups (Jin et al., 2005), Fourier analysis (Jonsson et al., 2004) and Krylovs subspaces
(Chaniotis and Pai, 2005).
In the second phase, a feasible cut-set (composed of transmission equipments) is determined
in order to physically separate the bus sets that
were grouped in the previous phase. Usually,
graph theory is employed, and the problem is
modeled as a constrained optimization problem,
where the objective could be to nd a cut-set
composed of a minimal number of equipments,
or the one that minimizes the interrupted power
ow (minimal power unbalance inside the islands)
(Wang and Vittal, 2004), or even the one that
maximizes the number of preserved markets contracts in the post-islanding scenario (Vittal and
Heydt, 2009). The combinatorial nature of this
problem results in a large computational eort
when determining the best islanding strategy.
After a candidate cut-set (splitting strategy)

The islanding formation (splitting) problem in power system grids can be analyzed into two dierent contexts security assessment and corrective
control. In the security assessment context, the
islanding formation is unintentional (undesired)
and the concern is determining, given a set of credible contingencies, if the post-fault system will be
physically divided in more than one electrical island (Guler and Gross, 2007). In the corrective
control context, islanding formation is intentional
(desired), and the concern is to determine how to
split the system into pieces constrained by security andor operational requirements (Wang and
Vittal, 2004).
There are very ecient methods for islanding analysis in the context of security assessment.
For instance, the algebraic-graph (AG) method
proposed in (Theodoro et al., 2010 Theodoro
et al., 2011 Theodoro et al., 2012) is fast and detects all the critical branches with a single factorization of the node-branch incidence matrix. This
paper is an attempt to extend an AG method,
early developed for assessment of unintentional islanding, to the intentional islanding problem.
The intentional (controlled) island forma-

is determined in the second phase, its regularity
has to be checked to ensure that the proposed cutset does not separate the system into more islands
than desired (Xu and Vittal, 2010). Checking connections in a large network can be a cumbersome
task, so an important issue in these methods is
how to model cut-sets and how to eciently determine the regularity of generated cut-sets.
A novel AG method for intentional island formation is proposed in this paper. The developed method uses an ordered lower triangular factorization (de Souza et al., 2012) of the nodebranch incidence matrix, associated with the power system grid, in order to rapidly produce candidate cut-sets. After a candidate is selected as
a viable one, the method proposed in (Theodoro
et al., 2011 Theodoro et al., 2012), for branch redundancy (criticality) analysis, is employed to efciently check its regularity. The weighted unionnd algorithm is employed, in association with the
method for branch criticality analysis proposed in
(Theodoro et al., 2012), to regularize a candidate
cut-set when it is necessary. This association enables the regularization with low computational
cost.
The paper is organized as follows in Section 2
the main theoretical results that provide the basis
for the proposed hybrid algebraic-graph method
are depicted in Section 3, the proposed methodology is presented and discussed in section 4, the
hybrid algebraic-graph method is tested in a small
power system, and its results are discussed nally,
in section 5, the main conclusions are highlighted
and future works are presented.

being Hij the element in the i-th row and j-th column of H, and wij the weight of the branch i  j.
The concepts of cut (in the N -space) and cutset (in the E-space) of a graph play important roles
in the power system islanding formation problem,
once any solution of this problem can be represented as a cut-set of the associated graph.
Definition 2 (Cut) A cut is a partition P 
X, X   of N in two not-empty disjoint subsets,
which satises X  X   N .
Definition 3 (Cut-set) A cut-set C(P ) or
C(X, X  ), being X, X   N , X  X   N and
X  X   , is a set of branches (edges) composed
of all the branches incident to one node of X and
one node of X 
The proposed hybrid AG method performs
the topological (islandingcut-set) analysis of the
power system grid associated with the graph
G(N , E), based on the following results.
Theorem 1 (Fundamental Cut-set Theorem)
Consider a graph G(N , E) and its associated node-branch incidence matrix H.
Let
C  e1 , e2 , ..., ek   E be a set of edges, thus,
C is a cut-set (C(X, X  )) for the graph G if and
only if it can be identied (represented) by means
of linear combinations of rows of H.
Proof See Appendix A.

We can verify that the non-zero elements at
any row of matrix H identify a set of branches
(cut-set) that separates the corresponding node
from any other node in the graph G. Also it is
possible to demonstrate that combining 2 rows
(performing element-wise sums) it is possible to
create a cut-set that separates the corresponding
2 nodes (connected to each other or not) from any
other node in the graph G (Chen, 1971).
The Fundamental Cut-set theorem has as a
consequence the next corollary.

2 Graph Theory Theoretical
Foundations for Intentional Islanding
Analysis
Consider a power system grid composed of n buses
and l transmission lines  transformers, and represented by an associated connected graph G(N , E),
which is composed of a pair of sets N , of n nodes,
and E, of l branches (or edges).
Among the many possible representations of
a graph, the node-branch incidence matrix is suitable for our purposes.
Definition 1 (Node-branch incidence matrix)
Consider an arbitrary (pseudo) orientation over
the branches in the graph G(N , E). The nodebranch incidence matrix H associated with this
graph, is a n  l matrix with elements Hij as

Corollary 1 (Triangular Factorization)
Consider a graph G(N , E) and its associated
node-branch incidence matrix H. Let HF be the
resulting matrix of the triangular factorization
(LU-decomposition performed by rows) of matrix
H, then the sets of branches related to non-zero
entries of each row of HF compose cut-sets for
the graph G.
Corollary 1 suggests that the factorization
of the node-branch incidence matrix can be eciently used to generate candidate cut-sets for the
intentional islanding problem.
Consider the graph G(N , E). Given two subsets of nodes U, U   N , any cut-set C(XU , XU  ),
satisfying U  XU and U   XU  , separates the

nodes in U from those in U  , in the sense that
there is no path (composed of branches) in the set
EC(X, X  ) that connects any node of U with a
node of U  .
In the intentional islanding problem, we are
not interested in any cut-set C(XU , XU  ) of
G(N , E). But we are interested in those cut-sets
which generate only the desired number of islands
in the post-islanding system, i.e., we are interested
in the regular cut-sets.

an ordered lower triangular factorization is applied to the node-branch incidence matrix associated with the power system grid, and a candidate
cut-set is determined considering a proposed objective function. In the second phase, the regularity of the previous candidate cut-set is analyzed.
If it is not regular, a new regularization procedure is employed to produce a regularized cut-set,
which has always less elements than the previous
candidate.

Definition 4 (Regular cut-set) A
cut-set
C(XU , XU  ), with U  XU and U   XU  , is
regular if and only if it divides the graph G(N , E)
into two, and only two, connected components.

3.1

Modeling the Objective Function for Intentional Islanding Formation

In a general sense, the objective function J in the
intentional islanding problem can be expressed as
a sum of the weights of the branches (transmission
equipments) which compose the cut-set

J(C(XU , XU  )) 
w lk
(2)

Checking the regularity of a cut-set is very
challenging. Our approach to determine the regularity of a cut-set is based on branch criticality
analysis.

lk C(XU ,XU  )

Definition 5 (Branch criticality) Consider
the graph G(N , E). A set of branches (edges)
B  l1 , l2 , ..., lk  is a critical k-tuple if it is a
cut-set for some subsets of nodes N1 , N2  N ,
and any strict (proper) subset Bs  B is not a
cut-set.

Modifying the weights stored in matrix H enables the method to deal with dierent objectives
in the intentional islanding problem. For instance,
considering that all the branches have the same
weight equal to one, then minimizing this objective function is equivalent to minimize the number of edges (transmission equipments) in the cutset. On the other hand, if the weights are equal
to the magnitude of the power ow through the
branches, then minimizing this objective function
is now equivalent to minimize the interruption of
power in the post-island system.
The proposed hybrid AG method deals with
the intentional islanding problem by means of a
node-branch incidence matrix (H) factorization.
It is important to highlight that the proposed
method is not able to guarantee the global optimum, unless an enumeration procedure is used
but the method is able to fast compute viable
candidates. If the operator is not satised with
the solution, then the candidate cut-sets can be
used as good initial conditions for other optimization techniques.

The triangular factorization of the nodebranch incidence matrix H can also be used to
analyze the criticality of branches. Next theorem
shows that the node-branch incidence matrix can
always be written in a factorized form (Theodoro
et al., 2012).
Theorem 2 (Factorized form HF ) Let H be
the node-branch incidence matrix associated with
a graph G(N , E), with n nodes and l  n  1
branches. If the graph is connected, then there
is an invertible matrix C such that HF  C1 H
assumes the form


I(n1)(n1) R(n1)q

being q  l  (n  1), I the identity matrix and
R the branch redundancy matrix.

3.2

Fast Determination of Solutions

The Proposed Hybrid Algebraic-Graph
Method for Intentional Islanding

In the rst phase of the proposed hybrid AG
method, an ordered lower triangular factorization
of the node-branch incidence matrix H (de Souza
et al., 2012), associated with the graph  power
system grid, is performed to fast generate viable
candidates for the proposed intentional islanding.
In the second phase, a criticality (redundancy)
analysis based on the triangular factorization of
matrix H is used to verify regularity of the candidates.

The novel hybrid AG method to deal with the intentional islanding problem, proposed in this paper, is divided into two phases. In the rst phase,

Algorithm 1 (Generation of Solutions)
Consider a power system grid, an objective function J, and two set of buses (nodes) U and U 

Using theorem 2 and the ideas proposed in
(Theodoro et al., 2012), for redundancy (criticality) analysis of a set of branches, it is possible to
determine the criticality of all branches in a graph,
and consequently in the associated power system
grid.

The regularity of the cut-set Cbest (XU , XU  ),
in step 7 of Algorithm 7, can be veried by
means of a simple lower triangular factorization
of matrix H (excluding all the branches of cutset Cbest (XU , XU  ) from matrix H), and verifying if there are only two connected factorization
paths (corresponding to two islands in the system)
in the lower triangular matrix L (resulting from
the lower triangular factorization of H) (Theodoro
et al., 2011 Theodoro et al., 2012). In the case
where the candidate cut-set is not regular, a procedure for regularization is proposed in Algorithm
3.

that must be separated in the intended intentional
islanding

Remark 1 (Extension of the Islanding Analysis)
Algorithm 1 can be iteratively extended to cases
in which the islanding requires the formation of
more than two islands, just separating one island
at each time.

1. Built the node-branch incidence matrix H of
the graph G(N , E) related with the power system grid
2. Aggregate the set of nodes U and U  into supernodes (see Fig. 1), positioning the supernodes relative to U and U  in the rst and last
rows of H respectively

Remark 2 (Exclusion of Trivial Solutions)
Algorithm 1 performs a general splitting analysis,
so after step 4 trivial solutions can be provided by
the method in case of simple problems as separating a single generator from the system, however
such simple splitting strategy could be proven
eectively sometimes, so it is recommended that
operator check the viable candidate cut-sets at
step 5.

3. Perform the ordered lower triangular factorization of matrix H (Algorithm 2) and obtain
matrix HF 
4. For each row of the factorized matrix HF , the
set of branches associated with non-zero elements of this row composes a viable cut-set
that actually separates node U from node U  

Next, the ordered lower triangular (LT) factorization algorithm of the node-branch incidence
matrix is presented.

5. Evaluate the objective function J over all the
viable candidates cut-sets, possibly excluding trivial solutions, and verify the best suitable candidate Cbest (XU , XU  ) for the island
formation.

Algorithm 2 (Ordered LT Factorization)
Consider a power system grid, its associated
graph G(N , E) with the node-branch incidence
matrix H, and the objective function J

6. If the objective function tolerance was reached
them proceed to the next step. Otherwise go
to step 3 choosing other factorization path

1. Do k1
2. For the k-th row (node k) of H, determine the
set k (searching at columns of H), composed
of all nodes that connect node k (possibly excluding the node U  )

7. Verify if the cut-set Cbest (XU , XU  ) is regular. If it is regular then stop otherwise proceed to the solution regularization (Algorithm
3) and stop

3. Determine the node, m  k , whose aggregation with node k results in the cut-set that
best ts the objective function J

The node (bus) aggregation, in step 2 of Algorithm 1, can be accomplished over the initial
node-branch incidence matrix replacing the rows
of a desired set of nodes with the sum of such rows.
Any connection which is external to the set U (U  )
will be preserved and all internal connections will
disappear as result of this sum, as presented in
Fig 1. If there are sets of branches (transmission
equipments) that can not be interrupted, it is trivial to prevent these sets from composing the generated cut-sets just aggregating the buses incident
to these branches, which will automatically make
any internal branch (edge) to disappear, as shown
in Fig 1.

4. Exchange the positions of rows (k+1) and
m of H, and sum (aggregate) the k-th and
(k+1)-th rows of H
5. Do kk+1, and if kn-1 then stop otherwise
go to step 2
In case two or more cut-sets present the same
value of the objective function in step 3 of the
Algorithm 2, then there are two or more possible
factorization (aggregation) paths to choose. Different choices of factorization paths generally will

1383

generate dierent candidate cut-sets, and this feature can be exploited to produce more candidates
when needed.
It is also important to notice that all factorizations are performed by row-operations, which
conserve the branch information (stored in the
columns of matrix H) and allow the correct identication of the cut-sets.
Next, the regularization procedure of the candidate cut-set Cbest (XU , XU  ) is presented.

matrix H in step 1, and positioning the nodes of
the generators G1 and G2 at the rst and last rows

following matrix H

The factorized node-branch incidence matrix
HF (after the ordered lower triangular factorization), obtained at step 3 of Algorithm 1, can be
written as



The criticality (redundancy) analysis, in step
1 of Algorithm 3, can be eciently done applying
the AG method develop in (Theodoro et al., 2010
Theodoro et al., 2011 Theodoro et al., 2012). It
is possible to prove that all critical branches can
be identied with just one triangular factorization
(LU-decomposition performed by rows) of matrix
H. And all critical pairs can be identied with
(n  1) refactorizations of matrix H, and so on.
Finally, the regularity verication of the ktuples, in step 2 of Algorithm 3, can be eciently
done with use of the weighted union-nd algorithm. The weighted union-nd algorithm is faster
than the determination of factorization paths by
lower triangular factorization , when just a connectivity test between nodes U and U  is needed.

The rows of HF are candidate cut-sets.
All the candidates are viable, once they
all separate the generators from each other.
However, the best candidate (considering the
minimization problem 
with objective function J(C(G1 , G2 )) 
i,jC(G1 ,G2 ) wij ) is
Cbest (G1 , G2 )  L1 , L6 , L8 , L9 , identied in
the third row of HF . Remember that the rst
and last two rows of HF dene trivial cut-sets
isolating a generator from the grid, and in this
example such splitting strategies (cut-sets) were
not considered reasonable solutions.
The regularity of the candidate cut-set
Cbest (G1 , G2 )  L1 , L6 , L8 , L9  still needs to be
checked. Thus lets perform the lower triangular factorization of matrix H  , built without the
branches in the candidate cut-set, and identify all
factorization paths (Theodoro et al., 2012) in ma-

Test Results and Discussions

Consider the system of Fig 2. The intended islanding formation requires that each generator stays
in one island, minimizing the number of interrupted transmission lines. Therefore, the problem is to determine a practical minimum cutset in the graph associated with the power system
grid, which can be modeled in the node-branch
incidence matrix H by means of unitary weights
(wij  1).

power systems, considering dierent types of objective functions, will be reported in a future paper.
As future developments, we propose to study
the intentional islanding problem constrained to a
minimum load shedding, and the development of a
new data structure to take advantage of the nodeincidence matrix in the search of paths between
two nodes in a graph.














Acknowledgment

Analyzing the lower triangular matrix
L , we conclude that the candidate cut-set
Cbest (G1 , G2 )  L1 , L6 , L8 , L9  is not regular,
which is proved by the existence of three factorization paths in the lower triangular matrix resulting
from the factorization process P1  b1 , b6 , b7 ,
P2  b2 , b3  and P3  b4 , b5 . Therefore, a
regularization procedure is needed in order to
reduce the cut-set.
Performing a triangular factorization of the
initial matrix H, the only critical branch in
the system, L10 , is identied.
The branch
L10 is not contained in the candidate cut-set
Cbest (G1 , G2 )  L1 , L6 , L8 , L9 . So it is necessary to verify the existence of critical pairs
of branches, which could be accomplished by
(n  1) refactorizations of matrix H (Theodoro
et al., 2012). However, the number of possibilities
inside the cut-set under analysis (C4,2  6 possibilities) makes the test by the weighted union-nd
algorithm (Sedgewick and Wayne, 2011) a better
choice than the identication of the factorization
paths.
Thus, making the required tests, the critical
pair L6 , L8  is identied inside the candidate cutset. This critical pair does not separate nodes U
and U  , so it can be eliminated from the original
cut-set and the best cut-set for the intended islanding is now Cbest (G1 , G2 )  L1 , L9 , which
separates node U and U  in two, and only two,
dierent islands.

Proof of the Fundamental Cut-set
Theorem

The proof of the Fundamental Cut-set Theorem can be accomplished adapting the developed
graph theory for incidence matrices of references
like (Chen, 1971) and others. For this purpose the
following denitions need to be stated in order to
set the background for the following proofs.
Definition 6 (Subgraph) A subgraph G(N , E),
of a graph G(N , E), is a graph composed of a pair
of sets N  N and E  E.
Definition 7 (Aggregated Graph) Given a
partition P  X, X   of the graph G(N , E), the
aggregated graph GX (N , E) is the one composed
of the nodes in X  union with a ctitious node
k such that every edge of the set EX  (which
denotes the set of all edges of E that have both
vertices in X  ) is an edge of GX and moreover,
an edge e  (k, j) belongs to the set of edges E if
there exists an edge (i, j)  E, with i  X, that
belongs to C(X, X  ). Then the resulting graph
GX (N , E) is an aggregated graph of G(N , E)
where the nodes of the set X were represented by
a single equivalent node k, which will be called the
aggregated node.

Conclusion

A novel algebraic-graph (AG) method, based on
the triangular factorization of node-branch incidence matrix (branch criticality analysis), was
proposed to deal with the intentional islanding
problem. The main advantages of the proposed
method are (i) fast computation of viable candidate cut-sets, (ii) simple implementation, and
(iii) ecient procedure for regularization of cutsets.
The proposed AG method is able to avoid interruption of selected tie-lines in a simple and efcient way. It also identies redundancy of elements in any viable cut-set and regularizes it to
its minimum number of components (edges). The
proposed method was tested in simple power systems with promising results. Tests in large scale

Now, in order to prove the Fundamental Cutset theorem, the next two lemmas will be proved.
Lemma 1 (Rank-Connectivity Lemma)
Consider a graph G(N , E), ant its associated
node-branch incidence matrix H. The graph
G is a disjoint reunion of p, p > 1, connected
subgraphs if and only if rank(H)  n  p, with n
the number of nodes in the set N .
Proof () Suppose that the graph G is
disconnected, i.e., it is composed by a
disjoint reunion of p connected subgraphs
G1 (N1 , E1 ), G2 (N2 , E2 ), ..., Gp (Np , Ep ). Then,
its node-branch incidence matrix H can be organized in the following way change the rows of H

to put, in the rst n1 rows of H, the rows related
to the rst subgraph G1 , and change the columns
of H to put, in the rst e1 columns, the edges of
the subgraph G1 . Repeat this ordering process
with the other p-1 subgraphs in the subsequent
rows and columns of matrix H. The resulting
matrix H assumes the form

being Hi the node-branch incidence matrix associated with the subgraph Gi (Ni , Ei ), i1, ..., p.
Therefore, from theorem 1 of (Theodoro et al.,
2012) we have that rank(Hi )  ni -1, for i1, ...,
p, and it follows, from the structure of H, that
rank(H)

For this reason, it is possible to repeat the
above decomposition process over matrix H, to
organize the matrix H as follows

Hp np ep 
As matrices Hi , i1, ..., p, have exactly two
non-zero elements in its columns, and rank(Hi )
ni -1, then each of these matrices is a nodebranch incidence matrix associated with a subgraph Gi (Ni , Ei ), i1, ..., p, and again from theorem 1 of (Theodoro et al., 2012) we have that each
subgraph Gi is connected and the result is proven.

Lemma 2 (Node-aggregation Lemma)
Consider a graph G(N , E), and its associated
node-branch incidence matrix H. Let GX (N , E)
be an aggregated graph of G with node-branch
incidence matrix HX , thus, a node k  GX is
an aggregated node if and only if the row of HX
related with node k can be obtained by means of
linear combinations of rows of H.

() Suppose that rank(H) n-p. From theorem 1 of (Theodoro et al., 2012) we have that if
p > 1, then the graph is a disjoint reunion of subgraphs. Moreover, there are at least p dierent
linear combinations (element-wise sums) of rows
of H that results in the null row.
Now, we are going to prove that each of these
p element-wise sums results, in fact, from the sum
of all rows of a node-branch incidence matrix Hi
related with a connected subgraph Gi (Ni , Ei ) of
G(N , E), which will be proved to be a disjoint reunion of such subgraphs. Thus, reordering the
rows and columns of matrix H, so that the nonzero entries in the rst e1 columns are located in
the rst n1 rows of H, and all the entries in these
rows, after the column e1 , are equal to zero. Then,
the node-branch matrix H assumes the form


H1 n1 e1 
H
H(nn1 )(ee1 )

Proof () Let X  k1 , k2 , ..., kL   N be a
subset of nodes in the graph G, and k its associated aggregated node in the aggregated graph
GX . Thus, it is straightforward to see that all
the edges that connect a node in X with a node
j  X  , X  X   N , in the graph G, now connect the aggregated node k to the node j in the
aggregated graph GX , and all the edges that interconnect nodes of X are excluded from GX .
Observing the rows h1 , h2 , ..., hL  of the incidence matrix H, one-to-one related to the nodes
in X, we can conclude that the element-wise sum
of these rows result in a row with all the non-zero
entries of the summed rows related to the edges
incident to these nodes, but excluding all the entries related to edges that interconnect the nodes
in X. So any aggregated node k  GX , related
with an aggregation of L nodes in the graph G,
can be represented by the linear combination of L
respective rows in H.
() The element-wise sum of L rows,
h1 , h2 , ..., hL , of the node-branch incidence matrix H, originates a row that has all the non-zero
entries of the summed rows, possibly excluding
the entries that became zero by the sum (which
represents internal edges).
Therefore, observing the articial node k related to this new row, it should be noted that
it has all the connections that interconnect the
nodes X  k1 , k2 , ..., kL   N to the nodes
X   kL+1 , kL+2 , ..., kn   N in the original
graph G(N , E). So this row corresponds to the
row of an aggregated node, of the set of nodes X,

Noticing that each column of matrix H1 has
exactly two non-zero entries, this matrix in an incidence matrix, and rank(H1 ) < n1  1. Also, we
can assume that there is no L < n1 such that the
sum of L rows of H1 is null, then rank(H1 ) n1 -1.
Therefore, matrix H1 is a node-branch incidence
matrix associated with a subgraph G1 (N1 , E1 ).
Thus, by theorem 1 of (Theodoro et al., 2012),
the subgraph G1 is connected.
It is important to realize that matrix H also
has two non-zero elements in each of its columns
and it is also an incidence matrix. As an incidence matrix, rank(H) < (n  n1 )  1, therefore
rank(H)(n  n1 )  m, and remembering that
rank(H)  rank(H1 ) + rank(H)
we have m  p  1.

Proof Fundamental Cut-set Theorem ()
Given a cut-set C  C(X, X  ) resulting from a
partition P (X, X  ), aggregate all the nodes inside
the set X into a single aggregated node k in the
aggregated graph GX (N , E). It is important to
realize that all entries that are related to edges
that interconnect nodes in X become zero in the
row of node-branch incidence matrix H related to
the aggregated node k.
Therefore, all non-zero entries, in the row of
matrix H related to the node k, are one-to-one
related to branches in a set C(X, X  ). So, applying the Node-aggregation Lemma is straightforward to conclude that any cut-set C(X, X  ) can
be identied (represented) by means of linear combinations of rows of the matrix H.
()From theorem 1 of (Theodoro et al., 2012)
we have that rank(H)  n-1, so it is straightforward that any matrix H   M 1 H M , with matrix M invertible, is similar to H and rank(H  ) 
rank(H)  n-1. In particular, any matrix resulting from linear combinations (element-wise sums)
among rows of H has rank equal to n-1.
Then, from the Node-aggregation Lemma, the
resulting matrix H  has its rows associated with
nodes and aggregated nodes in an aggregated
graph GX originated from the graph G. Consequently, if any set of branches Ck , related to the
non-zero entries of a k-th row of the matrix H  , is
taken from the aggregated graph GX , then there
is at least one sum of L, L < n, rows of H  that
results in a null row. So, it is straightforward that

rank(H(C
)  n  p < n  1 and also rank(H(Ck ) )
k)
 n  p < n  1, where the underscript (Ck ) indicates that the set of branches Ck was eliminated
from the original graph.
Finally, from the Rank-Connectivity Lemma,
if rank(H(Ck ) )  n  p, p > 1, then the graph is
a disjoint reunion of p connected subgraphs, and
the set of branches Ck is a cut-set C(X, X  ) for
the graph G and the result is proven.
