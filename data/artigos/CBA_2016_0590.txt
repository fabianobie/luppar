Abstract Pedestrian detection has become central in recent years mainly due to the emerging of driver
assistance systems. One of the main challenges in this area is how to design a good detector, since there is
no general theory that guarantees even regular results in detection and most solutions are developed based on
empirical experiments by trial and error. Because of this, some works have proposed bio-inspired or data-driven
techniques to solve the problem. In this sense, one of the most important part of a detector is the feature
extraction. It is from the feature extraction step that is expected the great improvement in detection quality.
This work uses theories related to neural cells to support the generation of features to a classifier that is part of
a pedestrian detection system. As baseline, the Filtered Channel Features framework is used to analyse, apply
and evaluate the method proposed.

Introduction

Pedestrian detection is important due to the relevance of the detection, identification and monitoring of humans in a variety of scenes (Nguyen
et al., 2016). However, this research area has become central in recent years, mainly due to the
emerging of driver assistance systems (Geronimo
et al., 2010).
One of the main problems in pedestrian detection is how to design an accurate detector. There
is no general rule and most of the works in the
literature were developed based on trial and error. An important step in a pedestrian detection
system is the feature extraction. It is from feature extraction that the improvement in the detection quality is expected for the next years (Dollar
et al., 2012). The classifier is also an important
part of a pedestrian detection system, but there
are many different classifiers that have similar detection quality results, as observed in (Benenson
et al., 2015), while the principal distinction between them resides in what are the features being
used.
This work addresses the feature extraction
step, while the classifier employed is the decision
forest (DF) trained via AdaBoost, used by lots of
successful state of art detectors (Viola et al., 2003
Dollar et al., 2009 Benenson et al., 2013 Zhang

ISSN 2525-8311

et al., 2015). As baseline for the feature extraction
step, the Filtered Channel Features framework is
used, more specifically the features used in the
LDCF (Locally Decorrelated Channel Features)
detector proposed in (Nam et al., 2014). LDCF
is a slight modification of the ACF (Aggregated
Channel Features) detector (Dollar et al., 2014)
which is also used in this work as baseline, and
whose source code is publicly available1 . These
two detectors are built using 10 channel features
and, after channels computation, a filtering procedure is performed before sending a single pixel
lookups as features to the classifier. This is the
reason ACF and LDCF are categorized as part of
the Filtered Channel Features Detectors, as first
stated by (Zhang et al., 2015). Another reason to
choose LDCF as baseline is because it is a datadriven technique as well as the method presented
in this work.
In this paper, the LDCF detector is modified to use other filtering process that is inspired
in neural cells and uses concepts of natural image statistics. The objective is to have a more
grounded filter choice, differently of the work presented in (Zhang et al., 2015), where some filters
were used to generate features without any investigation on the problem data structure, as were

the cases of Checkerboards and RandomFilters.
Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is
employed to remove the local image dependence,
inspired by the LDCF detector that uses LDA
(Linear Discriminant Analysis) to remove correlation locally. The objective of LDCF detector is
to remove local correlation improving the classification accuracy of decision trees with orthogonal
splits. Decision trees with orthogonal splits, using
decorrelated data, outperform trees with obliques
splits while being more computationally efficient.
Oblique trees outperform orthogonal trees only
when both use correlated data (Nam et al., 2014).
By using ICA, it is expected to have a higher statistical order of decorrelation, and taking advantage of the connection between ICA, sparse coding
and simple cells theories, when applied to natural images. This will provide a filtering approach
that roughly simulates the way the brain, more
specifically the visual cortex, processes information. The way our visual system processes data is
a very intuitive inspiration to design data processing techniques, like the case of data-driven feature
generation.
This paper is organized as follows in Section 2, a brief review of the literature is presented,
and Section 3 details the baselines used to develop
and evaluate the approach presented in this paper.
Section 4 discusses the ICA theory and its relation
to sparse coding and simple cells for natural images. At this time, the way ICA is employed in
this work is clarified. Finally, in Section 5, the
experiments and results are presented and analysed and Section 6 presents the conclusions of this
work.

Related Work

The solutions to the pedestrian detection problem can be, in a simplified manner, categorized
as silhouette matching and appearance-based. In
the silhouette matching approach, a region of interest (ROI) is extracted before classification, to
avoid an excess of background area (Geronimo
et al., 2010). The classification step can be accomplished using a simple similarity measurement, as
correlation. Nonetheless, most successful works
use an appearance-based approach. Such methods
employ features (descriptors) to represent the differences between image patches and train a classifier, often in a supervised manner. Generally, the
classifier is applied to the image in a sliding window approach as is the case of the top ranked detectors. Sliding window techniques tend to be part
of detectors that outperform those ones that use
segmentation or keypoints (Dollar et al., 2012).
The focus of this work will also be appearancebased techniques employing the sliding windows
methodology.
In 2003, Viola and Jones (Viola et al., 2003)

ISSN 2525-8311

used their cascade general object detector for the
pedestrian detection task. The detector employed
features generated using Haar-like templates positioned to model pedestrian body parts. Two years
later, Dalal and Triggs (Dalal and Triggs, 2005)
proposed the widely used histograms of oriented
gradients (HOG), which are nowadays some of the
most used descriptors in recognition tasks. In
(Felzenszwalb et al., 2008), was proposed the Deformable Part Model (DPM). In this work, the
pedestrian was modelled by coarse whole body
and high resolution parts templates, where the position of the parts were considered dynamic and
latent. As classifier, a latent Support Vector Machine (SVM) that is a version of SVM adapted to
handle latent information was used.
In 2009, the performance of a variety of channels was investigated for the pedestrian detection
task by (Dollar et al., 2009). As a contribution of
that work, 10 channels were selected as appropriate for the task being considered L, U and V color
channels, six histograms of oriented gradients and
one normalized gradient magnitude. They were
found to give the best detection results when associated with a DF framework trained via AdaBoost
at that time and the detector was named ChnsFtrs. These channels are the same used in the
chosen baselines and are known as HOG+LUV in
the literature. The key difference between ChnsFtrs and the baselines is that, in the former, after
channels computation, the channels are passed by
a region pooling through 30000 random rectangular regions of different sizes and locations, using
integral images. After that, these 30000 candidate
features are sent to AdaBoost for feature selection.
This region pooling operation can be faced as a
filtering approach, a convolution of the channels
with a diverse set of masks. In ACF, after channels computation, the channels are aggregated and
AdaBoost receives the vectorized channels, single
pixel lookups, as features. In the case of LDCF,
in the place of region pooling, local decorrelation filters are used in the channels before sending
the vectorized decorrelated channels as features to
AdaBoost.
As time complexity is a question of particular importance in pedestrian detection, mainly
because the need of real time applications for car
driver assistance systems, different schemes were
developed to cope with the speed-up of detection.
In (Dollar et al., 2010), the computationally expensive multiscale detection of ChnsFtrs was simplified by an approximating exponential scaling
law of the features. Rather than computing features from resampled images at every scale, they
were computed at each octave2 and, between each
octave, the classifier was rescaled using the exponential scaling law approximation, avoiding im2 An octave is the interval between one scale and another
with half or double its value.

age resampling. This procedure resulted in the
called Fastest Pedestrian Detection in the West
(FPDW ), a five frame per second (fps) detector,
which represents an improvement of five fold in
relation to ChnsFtrs. In (Dollar et al., 2014), together with a fast feature pyramids computation,
ACF detector also employs a rejection stage for
examples with a score lower than an empirical
threshold. This procedure avoids exhaustive inspection in all trees in the DF classifier. This resulted in a 32 fps detector, approximately six fold
faster than FPDW.
In (Zhang et al., 2015), the Filtered Channel Features framework is defined and analysed
using six different filtering approaches. The InformedFilters are manually designed and correspond to human body templates, and Checkerboards filters are different samples of checkerboards patterns with varying size. RandomFilters are filters generated from random patterns
of different sizes and, as Checkerboards, are not
data-driven. LDCF, LDCF8 and PCAforeground
are data-driven and estimated using the theory of
data factorization. LDCF uses four filters that
are the four eigenvectors associated with the four
larger eigenvalues of the data covariance matrix.
LDCF8 is an additional scheme with eight filters and PCAForeground estimates four LDCF filters for positive and four LDCF filters for negative examples, and tries to simulate the effect
of Fishers Discriminant Analysis, considering the
background and foreground having different distributions. In (Zhang et al., 2015), the best results were achieved using Checkerboards, RandomFilters and InformedFilters. LDCF, LDCF8 and
PCAforeground achieved competitive results, but
they had the drawback of having a limited number
of eight filters.
Although the use of deep architecture for
pedestrian detection was questioned in (Benenson
et al., 2015), it was proved that this approach
can be competitive with or better than DF based
detectors in (Hosang et al., 2015). Finally, for
additional and more complete information the
reader can refer to (Geronimo et al., 2010 Dollar et al., 2012 Benenson et al., 2015).

Figure 2 ACF detection stage.
The LDCF detector is a slight variation of
the ACF detector, and has four decorrelation filters just after the downsampling operation. After
decorrelation, another downsampling by a fixed
factor of two is conducted. These decorrelation
filters are the eigenvectors of the data covariance
matrix associated with the four larger eigenvalues.
Uncorrelated data are more convenient for trees
with orthogonal splits as mentioned before, and
this is the inspiration to use decorrelation filters
(Nam et al., 2014). A final number of 40 channels
are obtained with the four filters of LDCF being
applied to the 10 HOG+LUV channels. These
channels features are also passed as single pixel
lookups to Adaboost.
ICA, Sparse Coding and Simple Cells

Baseline

In this work, the ACF and LDCF are used as
baseline. The workflow of the ACF detector in
the training and detection stages is ilustrated in
Figures 1 and 2, respectively. At the training
stage, the HOG+LUV channels features are computed after smoothing, and a downsampling is
conducted in the channels after another smoothing. Then, single pixel lookups is passed as feature
to AdaBoost. This shrinking operation, often by
a factor of four, is used to speedup training and
detection.

In (Hyvarinen et al., 2009, Chapters 7 and 8)
is shown that, for natural images, the latent linear coefficients si are as independent and sparse
as possible, when the features detectors Wi are
obtained through entropy minimization or sparseness maximization of a set of linear components s.
Thus, in this case, Equation 2 becomes an ICA
and a sparse coding (SC) of the image. When obtained from natural scenes, these SC models have
been shown to represent receptive fields (RFs)
similar to that of simple cells in macaque primary
visual cortex (V1) (Zhu and Rozell, 2013 Hyvarinen et al., 2009, Chapters 3 and 6). This minimum
entropy representation of the V1 information is related to the brain minimum energy consumption
during V1 activity. Nevertheless, it is important
to mention that, as recently shown by (Zylberberg
and DeWeese, 2013), these SC models are not the
only way to interpret the sensory computation in
brain, since, in some experiments, ferret demonstrated dense neural activity (less sparse) in V1,
as they matured viewing natural scenes movies.
In this work, the data-driven features detectors Wi will be estimated for each one of the
HOG+LUV channels, and will be applied locally
in the channels, as filter masks, in a process similar to LDCF. However, instead of providing a local
decorrelation, it is expected that these filters provide a local independence between the pixels of
the channels. Examples of masks generated from
each channel can be seen in the Figure 3. The
filters are generated using the FastICA algorithm,
described in (Hyvarinen et al., 2009, Chapter 18),
whose implementation is available online3 . To resize ICA filter masks to the required size, the nearest neighbour resampling strategy is employed, because it gives more consistent results in relation
to interpolation-based resampling. As the filters
are sparse, interpolation seems to attenuate filters
magnitude information. Figure 4 shows the four L
filters of the Figure 3 before the nearest neighbour
resampling.

Methodology of Experiments

To validate the results, the INRIA (Dalal and
Triggs, 2005) dataset is used. It has a training
set with 1208 positive examples (pedestrians) in
614 positive images, besides 1218 negative images without any pedestrian. The test set has
589 pedestrians in 288 positive images and also
453 negative images. The negative examples are
random sampled in the first stage of the training
and the additional negative samples are obtained
from the detector during the hard negative mining
stages.
The metric employed to compare detectors is
the log average miss rate (LogAvrMR), obtained
from the receiver operation characteristic (ROC)
curve called miss rate (MR) versus false positive
per image (FPPI) (Figure 7). The LogAvrMR is
obtained from the average of nine points between
102 and 100 FPPI in the ROC curve. A bounding box detection bbdt is considered positive if it
matches any valid bounding box ground truth bbgt
having a pascal measure higher than a threshold,
as expressed below
match(bbdt , bbgt ) 

area(bbdt  bbgt )
> 0.5.
area(bbdt  bbgt )

(3)

It is worth mentioning that the evaluation setup
is in par with (Dollar et al., 2009), which provides
the reference used in the area.
The model is obtained using as classifier a DF
trained via Real AdaBoost with 2048 level-3 binary decision trees, and a pedestrian model size of
128x64 pixels, before downsampling by a factor of
four. The model is built via three rounds of hard
negative mining (starting from 32 and then 128,
512 and 2048 trees). Each round adds 5000 additional negatives to the training set with a maximum of 10000 additional negatives. The sliding
window stride is 4 pixels. During experiments, different values for configurable parameters, as filter
sizes and number of filters are considered. Otherwise mentioned, all experiments are executed 10
times for different random seeds and then the average results and standard errors are presented.
This is a robust way of evaluating a detector, and
in most works presented in the literature is not
clear if this procedure is used or only the best result is considered. In some cases, the best result
can be much better than the average result, but it
should not be considered alone when evaluating a
detector.

over experiments. In Figure 5, the performance4
of ICCF filters are compared to the LDCF one
when varying the number and size of filters. As
can be seen from Figure 5(a), for 5x5 mask size,
the best performance of ICCF becames close to
the LDCF one for 18 and 25 filters. As the number of filters increases, ICCF seems to have a better performance, while LDCF decreases its performance. As mentioned in (Zhang et al., 2015), for
LDCF, past eight filters per channel, the eigenvalues decrease to negligible values and the eigenvectors become essentially random filters. Besides
that, for a 5x5 mask size, the maximum number of
LDCF filters that can be estimated is 255 , and to
have more filters the mask size must be increased.
As will be shown, this is a problem because the increase of the mask size corresponds to a reduction
in the detection quality. So, for LDCF, increasing
the number of filters to generate more features
seems to be a problem, while the same is not true
for ICCF.
Another observation from Figure 5(b) is that
detection quality of both methods decreases as
the size of the filter is increased. In fact, this is
also an observation of (Nam et al., 2014), (Zhang
et al., 2015) and (Yang et al., 2015), and, according to the last one, it seems that, as the mask size
increases, the focus on local and important cues as
edges and some texture information is lost. The
number of filters used for ICCF in Figure 5(b)
was set to 18 while for LDCF it was set to 12. As
can be observed from Figure 5, the best configuration obtained for ICCF is when using a 5x5 mask
size and 25 filters. However, since for 18 filters
the result is almost the same, this is preferred and
used from now on. The reason is that an increase
in the number of filters results in an increase in
detection and training times. For 3x3 mask size,
the maximum possible number of LDCF filters is
nine, and, thus, there is no result for this setup.

Table 2 shows the effect of ICCF when using
different channels configurations and employed together with LDCF. Note that the result of application of ICCF only to the four most used channels of Figure 6 is also presented. It is clear that
the diversification of the HOG channels (seven) is
more important than the LUV ones (three), but
the best result is achieved when all channels are
used, showing their complementarity. So, the LogAvrMR is observed to decrease as the number of
channels is increased.
The last two lines of Table 2 presents the results of ICCF (18 filters) when employed together
with LDCF (four and 12 filters). We can observe some complementarity between the ICCF
and LDCF with 4 filters (22 filters in total) because the average of LogAvrMR is reduced from
14.44 to 14.13 for LDCF. However, the same is
not observed for the case of LDCF with 12 filters

Conclusions

This work presented a pedestrian detection solution based on the Filtered Channel Features
Framework that used ICA to generate features
from the HOG+LUV Channels. In addition to
this feature extraction procedure, a DF classifier
trained via AdaBoost was used. The method was
tested in the INRIA dataset and tens of experiments were conducted. The results are in par with
the state of art methods and detection quality improvements were obtained in relation to the chosen
