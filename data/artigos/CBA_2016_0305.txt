Abstract This paper proposes a simplification in the LMI (Linear Matrix Inequality) formulation of an
output feedback robust model predictive control law for linear uncertain systems with polytopic description. The
proposed simplification leads to an equivalent LMI formulation, thus retaining the original guarantees of constraint
satisfaction and robust stability. The resulting computational gain is illustrated in a numerical example. More
specifically, a reduced number of iterations is required to find a feasible solution for the optimization problem.
Keywords Dynamic output feedback, robust model predictive control, linear matrix inequalities, computational workload.

Introduction

Robust Model Predictive Control (RMPC) is concerned with the receding-horizon control of uncertain systems subject to operational constraints
(Bemporad and Garulli, 2000). A popular approach consists of minimizing an upper bound for
an infinite horizon cost function, with model uncertainties expressed in terms of Linear Matrices
Inequalities (LMIs), as in (Kothare et al., 1996),
(Schuurmans and Rossiter, 2000), (Cuzzola et al.,
2002) and (Huang et al., 2011). Such formulations
typically employ full state feedback, which may be
an inconvenience if only partial state information
is available. In this case, state observers could be
used to estimate the state variables that are not
directly measured. However, the constraint satisfaction and stability guarantees may not hold if
the controller and observer are designed separately
(Wan and Kothare, 2002).
In order to retain these guarantees, a suitable Output Feedback Robust Model Predictive
Control (OFRMPC) formulation is required. A
common strategy is to employ a Dynamic Output Feedback Controller (DOFC) in an inner control loop, with the OFRMPC acting in the outer
loop (Granado et al., 2003), (Lee and Park, 2007),

ISSN 2525-8311

(Ding et al., 2008), (Ding, 2010), (Li et al., 2013).
With appropriate tuning (Colombo Junior et al.,
2015), recent OFRMPC formulations such as that
proposed in (Li et al., 2013) may achieve similar closed loop performance compared to the original state feedback RMPC approach (Kothare
et al., 1996).

In this context, the present paper proposes a
simplification of the LMI formulation presented in
(Li et al., 2013) in order to reduce the computational effort required for on-line implementation
of the OFRMPC control law. The proposed simplification leads to an equivalent LMI formulation,
thus retaining the original guarantees of constraint
satisfaction and robust stability.

The remainder of this paper is organized as
follows. Section 2 describes the problem statement and OFRMPC formulation proposed in (Li
et al., 2013). Section 3 brings the main contribution of the present work. Section 4 presents an
illustrative simulation example. Finally, concluding remarks are presented in Section 5.

Output feedback robust model
predictive control formulation

Consider the following polytopic uncertain system
x(k + 1)  Ax(k) + Bu(k)
y(k)  Cx(k)
(A, B, C)  

(1)
(2)
(3)

where x  Rnx is the state vector, u  Rnu is
the control input, y  Rny is the measurable system output and  is an uncertainty polytope with
known vertices (Ai , Bi , Ci ), where Ai  Rnx nx ,
Bi  Rnx nu and Ci  Rny nx , i  1, 2, ..., np .
The OFRMPC formulation adopted in (Li
et al., 2013) uses a DOFC given by
x(k + 1)  A0 x(k) + B0 y(k) + F1 x(k),
u(k)  sat(C0 x(k) + D0 y(k) + F2 x(k)).

Although the state is not measured, it is assumed that the initial state estimation error e(0) is
bounded by the expression eT (0)S(0)1 e(0)  1,
for a given S(0).
The OFRMPC formulation involves an
infinite-horizon cost function J (k) given by
J (k) 


X

Remark 1 This OFRMPC formulation assumes
normalized 1 bounds on the control variables.
Different values for these bounds can be taken into
account by scaling the columns of the input matrix B appropriately, as discussed in (Cao and
Lin, 2005).
Let z(k) be an augmented state vector defined



i0

(10)
where Pz  R2nx 2nx and Pu  Rnu nu are
symmetric, positive-definite weight matrices and
z(k + ik), u(k + ik) denote the future values of
z and u predicted on the basis of the information
available at time k.
In view of the uncertainty on the A, B, C
matrices, the optimization problem can be formulated in a min-max framework as

(4)
(5)

where sat is a 1 saturation function, x(k) 
Rnx represents the estimated state vector and A0 ,
B0 , C0 and D0 are matrices describing the DOFC
dynamics. The matrices F1  Rnx nx and F2 
Rnu nx are obtained as solution of the OFRMPC
optimization problem.

(13)
where yq,max denotes the bound on the magnitude
of the qth output variable.
As shown in (Li et al., 2013), this minmax problem can be replaced with the following
semidefinite programming (SDP) problem (14) (29), which involves the minimization of an upper
bound 2 for the cost J

Proposed simplification

With the aim of reducing the computational workload, the following theorem presents a simplification of the LMI constraint (29).

Theorem 1 The LMI constraint (29) is equivalent to

P(k). As demonstrated in (Li et al., 2013), if P(k)
is feasible at k  0, then P(k) will remain feasible for k > 0 and the closed-loop system will be
robustly stable.

In this formulation,  > 0, 1 > 0 and 2 > 0
are additional design parameters, which can be
tuned to improve closed-loop performance. More
details can be found in (Huang et al., 2011) and
(Li et al., 2013).

Definition 1 (Hu and Lin, 2001) The

subject to (15)-(28), (38).
It is worth noting that constraint (29) involves
n2p 2nu vertices (if D0 6 0), whereas (38) involves
only np vertices. Moreover, if matrix C is known,
the constraint (38) will involve only a single LMI.
If this optimization problem is feasible, the
gain matrices F1 and F2 are calculated as in (34)
and (35) at each sampling time. The constraint
satisfaction and robust stability guarantees from
(Li et al., 2013) are preserved because the proposed formulation is equivalent to the original one.

The state equation (40) needs to be discretized into form (1) for use in the OFRMPC
control law. Assuming that the motor voltage is

The OFRMPC was tuned with   1, 1 
100, 2  10, Pz  diag(1000, 0.1) and Pu  1.
The bounds on the control variable were set to
6 V, corresponding to the nominal voltage of
the DC motor employed in (Lordelo and Fazzolari, 2014), as indicated in (Quanser Consulting, 2015). The initial system state was set to
x(0)  4 0T , and the OFRMPC algorithm
was initialized with x(0)  29 0T and S(0) 
diag(18, 18).
The original and proposed formulations of the
SDP problem involved in the OFRMPC control
law were solved employing the Robust Control
Toolbox of MATLAB 2012a. The default settings
of the SDP solver were used. The simulations were
carried out with the (A, B2 ) vertex of the plant
model, which corresponds to K  2Knom .
Figures 1 and 2 present the resulting output and control signals, respectively. As can be
seen, the DC motor position was driven back to
the origin in approximately 10 sampling periods,
with proper enforcement of the control constraint.
The results obtained with the original and proposed implementations of the OFRMPC control
law are almost indistinguishable, which corroborates the equivalence between the two implementations. The minor differences observed in the results can be ascribed to numerical issues.

The sampling period was set to T  10 ms,
which is an order of magnitude smaller than the
settling time of the open-loop impulse response of
the system (117 ms for a 1  criterion).

Figure 3 presents the optimization cost (see
(14)) versus number of SDP solver iterations at
k  0. It is worth noting that the initial point
of each curve corresponds to the first feasible solution found by the solver. As can be seen, the

the SDP problem that needs to be solved at each
sampling time. In a simulation example, the number of iterations required by the SDP solver to find
a feasible solution was reduced from 74 to 58.
Work is being conducted to validate the proposed OFRMPC implementation in a laboratory
system, by using the experimental procedures described in (Colombo Junior et al., 2016).

It may be argued that the computational advantage of the proposed formulation would be less
significant at subsequent time instants, because
the solver can be initialized with the solution obtained at the previous sampling time. However,
non-modelled issues such as sensor noise, nonlinearities or exogenous disturbances may cause the
previous solution to be infeasible in practice. In
this case, the proposed implementation would be
useful to reduce the computational workload in
the search for a new feasible solution.
