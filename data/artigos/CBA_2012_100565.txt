Abstract  In this paper an experimental procedure to localize defects in coaxial cables and analyze the quality of connections
in a RF circuit is presented. The approach uses the reflection coefficients, measured with VNA (Vector Network Analyzer) in the
frequency-domain and algorithm to compensate the cable attenuation from defect to the measurement point. Then, the inverse
Fourier Transform (IFT) is applied to convert the signals to time-domain and a scheme to detect and localize discontinuities is
performed, mapping the path connections. The quality evaluation and defects localization are performed calculating the
difference between the value of the reflection coefficient for undamaged points and one for the same points with a defect
introduced. Cable defects and mismatching in connections are intentionally introduced to test the proposed method. This work
also presents the procedure to obtain the propagation constant in order to evaluate the effective value of the reflection coefficient
at the points of failures. The method proposed is useful especially in design of RF circuits, to adjust and check the compatibility
among components and for maintenance purpose, in order to monitor the cables and connections.
Keywords  RF circuits, defect localization, S parameters, time-domain reflectometry, frequency-domain reflectometry.

1 Introduction
A complete diagnosis in radio-frequency circuits
for communication systems concerns the investigation
of failures along the whole circuit under test, such as
holes in insulation, broken wires, breakdown of
insulation when exposed to moisture, connectors
tighter than necessary, etc. Generally the complete
study requires the following phases detection,
localization and, if possible, classification of the fault
in those components involved. Communication
circuits are applied in military and commercial
airplanes (Furse et al., 2001), nuclear power plants,
trains, communication systems in the industry
connecting instruments to device under tests, etc.
Defects in these systems not only lowers the system
accuracy in case of industry applications, where
accurate instruments monitors test systems, but can
cause tragedies if a maintenance team is not able to
detect a faulty component in an commercial aircraft.

The most common technique for locating
discontinuities in cables is the application of
reflectometry methods in time domain (TDR, time
domain reflectometry) or frequency domain (FDR,
frequency domain reflectometry). Essentially in TDRs
a short pulse is injected in the circuit under test from
the sending end and the reflected signals from
discontinuities are captured (Buccella et al., 2004).
These reflected signals contain a signature of the
discontinuities and the location and type of defect can
be extracted from it. Small defects are difficult to
detect because the variation in the signal signature is
small and does not permit to distinguish between fault
and no fault condition (Hayden, 1994).
The frequency-domain reflectometry (FDR)
(Furse et al., 2003) involves sending a set of
sinusoidal waveforms down to the cable and capture
their correspondent reflected waves. Analyzing the
pattern between these waves the distance and type of
faults can be determined also.
There are some variations of these types mixing
TDR with FDR techniques, but the principles for

5094

these variations are the same of the original methods
(Song et. al, 2009).
The aim of this paper is to apply an experimental
procedure to detect and localize defects in RF circuits
(cable defects and connection mismatching) and
compensating the cable attenuation. Initially the
reflection coefficients represented by S parameters are
captured by using the VNA in the frequency domain.
These coefficients are then compensated to take into
account the propagation effect (attenuation and
distortion) of the cables to show exactly the signal
signature originated at discontinuities. This is
important to evaluate potential faulty points for
detecting small defects and helping in fault prediction,
a step further in localizing defects. This kind of
prediction is mandatory in measurement systems
where a high accuracy is required for guarantee the
circuit integrity between instruments and devices
under test (DUTs). After this compensation
procedure, the signals are converted to time-domain
and an algorithm is performed to detect
discontinuities and defects along the circuit. The
connections are evaluated based on the value of their
reflection coefficients estimated according to the
datasheets. This evaluation takes into account all
components of the connection.
In the cables of the circuit under analysis three
types of defects was introduced cross section
reduction by applying a known force holes in the
shield and misconnection (loosened connector).
In the cross section reduction the cable is bent
beyond its tolerable radius. This defect is common in
industrial plants where heavy racks with
instrumentation accidentally may be moved over
cables.
The holes in the shield illustrates situation that
happens when a cable is moved against metallic
edges. In these cases the shield may be ruptured due
to excessive friction.
Referring to the misconnection, the aim here is to
quantify the variation of the reflection coefficient in
order to evaluate the degradation of the connection.
There are several practical situations involved tighten
connectors without the correct torque (too much
torque as an example), misaligned center conductors,
deformed threads, or bent. Usually defects and
damage that you cannot see without magnification
have no effect on the electrical performance, but
visual inspection is hard work to large systems in
industrial plants. Otherwise, connection and
reconnection for maintenance purpose with this kind
of inspection increase the risk of maintenanceinduced-damage (Furse et al., 2003), decreasing the
reliability and repeatability of measurement systems.
2 Fault location in time domain and
measurements in frequency domain
The signals were acquired in frequency domain
by using a VNA to obtain the S11 parameters of the
ISBN 978-85-8001-069-5

circuit under test. The S11 represents the ratio of the
signal reflected from the device to the incident signal

S11 ( ) 

b1
a1

(1)

where b1 is the reflected voltage and a1 is the incident
voltage seen by port 1 of the VNA. The reflection
coefficient has a temporal signature of the
discontinuity that contains information about the fault
severity translated according to the discrepancy
between it (with impedance ZD) and the transmission
line (with impedance Z0)

S11 ( ) 

Z D  Z0
Z D + Z0

(2)

Even a small discontinuity, as a well matched
connection, presents a mismatching level that can be
evaluated. From Eq. 2 there are two extreme
conditions
 Short-circuit (ZD  0) S11()  1,
phase  -180o
 Open circuit (ZD  ) S11()  1,
phase  0o
Any other discontinuity in the circuit will present
the reflection coefficient value between these limit
values. In a connection perfectly matched there is no
reflection, so S11()  0.
Once the fault has been detected, its distance can
be easily calculated by the following equation

d

v 
2

(3)

where d is the distance from the sending end (source)
to the fault, v is the propagation velocity and  is the
total travelling time from the source to the fault and
the time necessary to the reflected signal propagated
back. This propagation velocity can be calculated by
using the equation above and measuring the travelling
time of a discontinuity with its location previously
known. In this paper the cable velocity was that one
given in its datasheet.
Usually the fault location in time-domain is
performed by comparing the amplitude of the
reflection coefficients measured in a healthy circuit
with those measured in a damaged circuit (Buccela et
al., 2004) at the same location. The approach consists
in establish a threshold from the signals measured in
this undamaged circuit and use it as a criteria for
decision between fault and non-fault. Any reflection
coefficient with amplitude higher than this threshold
is an abnormal state and should be diagnosed as a
fault. The problem with this approach above is that
the propagation loss from the source to the fault and
from the fault to the source is not taken into account
by VNA. When the portion of the circuit under test is
a cable this does not represent big problem, because
any spike in the middle of a cable with amplitude
much bigger than noise level is already a fault. But in
case of connection analysis some additional
considerations are needed. So, the discontinuities seen

5095

by VNA in this situation do not represent the real
condition and degradation level of the components,
consequently defects will be under evaluated. In fact,
the reflection coefficients will be less than they really
are and small defects may be not detected. In order to
evaluate the connections, a threshold is used again,
but as connections have already a minimum
discontinuity an additional criteria should be used.
This additional criteria is the VSWR (Voltage
Standing Wave Ratio) or the RL (Return Loss), both
calculated for each connection in the healthy circuits
and used as reference to estimate the threshold. Both
this parameters can be expressed in terms of the
reflection coefficient

1 + S11

(4)

RL  20  log S11

(5)

VSWRL 

From these equations a threshold for VSWR or
RL can be established based on healthy connections
and cables at known locations. A low RL (or high
VSWR) means the connection is poor, and high RL
(or low VSWR) means that it is well matched. Poor
connections can degrade repeatability and accuracy in
a measurement system application.
2.1 Signal Compensation for Connections
In order to quantify the connection quality
according to Eq. 4 and 5 the reflection coefficient
needs to be compensated to evidence its real status.
Once this compensation procedure is performed, the
connections are then evaluated. A threshold value for
RL or VSWR can be estimated based on the
calculation of the compensated reflection coefficient
for the undamaged connection. The compensation
procedure is based on two opened-circuits as
illustrated in the Figure 1. Based on the reflection
coefficients measured for them, the propagation
constant can be calculated by (Woopoung, 2002)

subtracted by the length of the shorter cable, in this
case equal 36 in.

3.2 Frequency-Domain Measurements Setup
The measurements were performed by using the
VNA Agilent E5062A, with frequency range 300 kHz
 3 GHz, an 15 MHz frequency step. The propagation
velocity of the cables was given in its datasheet
0.77c, c is light speed in free space (c 
2.99792458x108 ms). The time resolution is 0.1667
ns, so the resolution is limited to 49.97 mm. Once the
measurements were performed in frequency domain,
the IFT (Inverse Fourier Transform) was performed to
get the signals in time domain and apply the
localization.
3.3 Defects
In this work the following damage cases were
studied
Case1 cross section reduction for cable (in the
Figure 2, component 6). A perpendicular force was
applied to the transversal section of the cable
according to the Table 1 that summarize the force
applied and deformation of the cable diameter. This
cable has a diameter  46 mm initially.

4 Experimental Results
The Figure 5 shows both compensated and
uncompensated reflection coefficient S11 in timedomain for the circuit of Figure 1 (healthy cables and
connections). The three pulses with higher
magnitudes indicate the discontinuities at the
connections. Based on the compensated signal, a
threshold for cable could be set to 0.005. After
compensation, the reflection coefficients for these
three connections have the following absolute
magnitudes 0.009, 0.025 and 0.021 respectively.
Based on the worst case (higher reflection coefficient)
and using the Eq. 5, a threshold value is obtained for
connections 30 dB (return loss).

The Figures 6 to 8 shows the reflection
coefficient from a fault generated at 1,719 mm from
the VNA port. At this location, different forces were
applied perpendicularly to the cross section of the
component number 6 (cable in the circuit showed in
Figure 2). The Table 3 below shows the return loss
calculated for each value of these forces. By using a
schema based on the threshold previously mentioned,
the fault can be detected at 1.765 mm, with 46 mm
error.
Although not enough to represent a damage of
high severity, the fault for 300 N can lowers the
accuracy of the entire system.
The Figure 7 and 8 shows the reflection
coefficient for 500 N and 1,500 N forces. The
severity of the damage in these cases not only lowers
the accuracy, but also can cause a faulty operation
(return loss smaller than 20 dB). In practice it is
assumed that a well matched circuit should have a
return loss higher than 20 dB.

The Figure 10 shows the results of the reflection
coefficient caused by holes in the cable. Although the
fault is distinguishable, the return loss is not so low in
comparison with cross section reduction. Visually the
damage seems to be severe (see the Figure 4), but the
absolute value of the reflection coefficient at the fault
location is low, consequently the return loss is
compared to a well matched connection (higher than
20dB).

5 Conclusion
This paper presented an experimental procedure
to detect faults in coaxial cables and analyze the
quality of connection in RF circuits after a
compensation schema. The results show that even
small faults, not visible in a visual inspection, as
reduction of cross section with low force applied or
holes in the shield, can be detected. Connections can
be evaluated also, but small defects are difficult to
discriminate and to diagnose, even if the damage is
visible because the reflection coefficient for the
damage state presents value similar to those ones for
healthy state. Nevertheless, these small changes in the
signal can be used to monitor the status of the
connection. The consideration of the propagation
effect for the calculation of the reflection coefficient
on the point of failure enables a more precise
evaluation of the mismatch caused by defects in the
RF path. In these cases, a real evaluation of the
discontinuities is possible and the degradation of the
circuit can be appropriately monitored. This will
avoid Fix after Failure problem since the fault can
be predicted and repair before a faulty operation.
After compensation, one can see that the damages are
bit severe than those cases with uncompensated
signals. So, is possible to evaluate the real status of
these connections and discontinuities and calculate
the contribution of these mismatching points for
measurement applications.
