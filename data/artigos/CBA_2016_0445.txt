Abstract Multiframe superresolution is a method that generates a higher resolution image (HR estimated
image) from several lower resolution images (LR images). A Bayesian approach is convenient for such purpose
because it is possible to incorporate pre-known information in the form of prior. This work implements an
SAR (Simultaneous Autoregressive) prior, which is better for softening noise, and a 1  norm and a TV (Total
Variation) prior, both known for the maintenance of edges. Besides, TVSAR and 1 SAR are also implemented
in order to take advantage of both possibilities. Iterative methods, namely Majorization Minimization and
Expectation Maximizations, are used to manage the non-analytical nature of the 1 priors and adjust the motion
parameters iteratively. SSIM and PSNR-based convergence conditions are used and compared, in terms of quality
and time processing evaluation. Previous works use full reference image quality metrics (FR-IQA) to choose the
output image, which makes them unsuitable for real cases. This work investigates a direct form of choice of the
estimated image, among the ones of all iterations. Such choice enables the application of our algorithm to real
cases, where the HR original image is unavailable.

Introduction

The term Superresolution (SR) first appeared
in (Irani and Peleg, 1990) and describes methods focused on enhancing images. These methods
generate a higher resolution image (HR estimated
image) from a set of lower resolution ones (LR
images). The size of such set characterizes the
Superresolution method. If we have more than
one LR image, it is called Multiframe Superresolution. Whereas, Singleframe Superresolution happens when the set has only one LR image. This
work focuses on Multiframe Superresolution.
Generally, Multiframe SR methods work like
this there are the original grids from each LR image and the new bigger grid, according to which
the estimated HR image is supposed to be adjusted. The LR images are displaced from each
other in a subpixel manner, therefore, the pixels from the HR image are actually formed by a
combination of their neighbors on the grids of the
LR images. However, it is necessary to align the
LR images to adjust them to the new bigger grid,
and this process of alignment is called registration
(Figure 1). The subpixel displacement enables the
Multiframe Superresolution process, since it pro-

of the scene.

when the target object of the scene is far away
from the camera (for example, in surveillance cameras). We can model the imaging system and, in
this case, the input of the model is the HR image (representing the scene) and the output, the
LR image (representing the observed image). An
SR method focuses on obtaining the HR image which is the latent variable from the model - using
the LR image, the observed variable. For this reason, Superresolution is defined as a inverse problem. Moreover, the imaging system contains additive random noise, which increases the complexity
of the problem.
A Bayesian approach is used in this work and
others (Katsaggelos et al., 2007). Statistics frameworks, such as Bayes, are generally suitable for
solving problems involving random noise. Besides,
using Bayes is interesting since it brings the possibility of incorporating information in the form
of prior probability density function, which is related to the HR image. The choice of the prior
PDF (Probability Density Function), in our context, is associated with noise reducing and the
maintenance of edges and other details. The SAR
prior, in theory, reduces the noise, but also the
edges. On the other hand, 1 -norm and TV priors maintain more edges. The Bayesian approach
sets up an optimization problem with the goal of
finding the HR estimated image that maximizes
the posterior PDF. The solution to this optimization problem is computed through iterative algorithms, using parameters of the imaging system
model and parameters from the prior PDF itself
the so-called hyperparameteres.
An important issue related to SR - and several
other signal processing problems - is Quality Assessment. When it comes to images, the more precise way to define quality is by visual inspection,
that is, just looking at the image and providing
a subjective evaluation. However, this procedure
is usually time-consuming and expensive (Wang
et al., 2004). Hence the importance of objective
metrics for image quality assessment. The concept of quality can be defined as similarity (or,
conversely, error) between the tested image and
a reference image. The methods based on such
concept are called Full Reference Image Quality
Assessment (FR-IQA). In this work, two FR-IQA
methods are used PSNR and SSIM.
The focus of this work is to investigate the
effect of modifying an iterative method of SR in
order to enable the use of such method in real
situations. The rest of this Section explores the
theoretical background used in this project and,
finally, explains our motivation and objective. In
Section 2, the reader finds the methodology used
in the experiments. Section 3 shows the experimental results and Section 4 concludes the paper
with a discussion about the results.

1.1

Imaging System Model

The imaging system model is written as
yk  AHk C(sk )x + nk ,

(1)

where yk is the k -th LR image, k  1..L (L being the number of LR images), x is the original
HR image and nk is the additive noise. All of
those are lexicographic representations of the respective signal. Besides, A is the down sampling
matrix, Hk is the blurring matrix and C(sk ) is
the warping matrix for the displacement vectors
sk  (l , ck , dk )t .
The blurring matrix describes the Point
Spread Function of the camera and others deformations. The warping matrix describes the displacement among the LR images like the ones in
Figure 1. And the down sampling matrix represents the scale between the LR images and the
HR image, that is, this matrix defines how much
the size of the image is increased by Superresolution. The random additive noise is Gaussian with
zero-mean.
1.2

Quality Metrics

1.2.1

Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)

The PSNR unit is decibels (dB) and it measures
the ratio between the maximum power of a signal and the noise that corrupts it. As a quality
metrics, it measures the ratio between the maximum power of the estimated image and the mean
squared error (MSE) between the two images being compared. It is calculated as shown below,
P SN R  10 log10 (

M AXx2
),
M SE

(2a)

where
M SE 

M 1 M 1
1 X X
x(i, j)  x(i, j)2 , (2b)
M M i0 j0

and M AXx2 is the maximum possible pixel value.
1.2.2

Structural Similarity Index Method

SSIM is an absolute measurement and its value is
between 1 and 1. However, it typically lies in
the range 0,1, being 1 if two identical images are
compared, and 0 if two completely different images
are compared. When calculating this value, the
system separates the task into three comparisons
luminance, contrast and structure, as discussed in
(Wang et al., 2004).

Bayesian Framework

The Bayesian framework we use (Villena et al.,
2010), (Villena et al., 2013) is based on,

p(xyk ) 

p(yk x)p(x)
 p(yk x)p(x),
p(yk )

(4)

where p(x) is the prior and p(xyk ) is the posterior. The likelihood p(yk x) has gaussian PDF
with mean equals to AHk C(sk )x.
The prior may be defined as one of the equations below, depending on its type. For the SAR
prior, the equation is,
M2

p1 (x 1 )  1 2 exp 

1
C x 2
2

(5)

where C is the Laplacian operator, 1 is the model
hyperparameter and M 2 is the HR lexicographic
vector dimension.
The 1 -norm prior is describes as,
p2 (x 2 )
2

 (2h 2v )

M2
4

exp 

M
X
2h hi (x)1 + 2v vi (x)1 ,
i1

(6)
where hi (x) and vi (x) are the horizontal
and vertical first order differences, respectively, for
the pixel i, and 2h and 2v are the model hyperparameters, each for one of the directions.
And the Total Variation (TV) prior is defined
as,
2

M q
3 X
hi (x)2 + vi (x)2 ,
2 i1
(7)
where hi (x) and vi (x) are the horizontal and
vertical differences, and 3 is the model hyperparameter.
The HR estimated image is calculated as the
result of an optimization problem that is summarized on Figure 2. The set of LR images (yk ) are,
of course, known by the method. So are the down

sampling A and blurring matrices Hk , the latter
because we consider that the modeling of the camera is already established. These three arguments
are the inputs of the algorithm. The main calculations are performed by the iterative part of the
process we set the initial registration parameters
and hyperparameters, then we evaluate the current estimated HR image (as explained in detail
in Villena et al. (2010)), adjust all parameters to
be used in the next iteration and finally, check the
convergence criteria. After the iterative method,
n HR estimated images are available and, therefore, the next step is to select the final HR estimated image, which is the result of the algorithm.
1.4

Motivation and Objective

The algorithms used in this work are iterative,
thus, they all have convergence conditions. Such
conditions are based on the two images estimated
in consecutive iterations. This work uses an SSIMbased convergence criteria and another one based
on MSE. As a result of these iterative methods,
we have more than one estimated image. In fact,
we have one image for each iteration. Some works,
such as Villena et al. (2013) choose the best one as
the result of the SR algorithms. In other words,
they choose the one with higher quality metrics
value. However, both PSNR and MSE are fullreference quality metrics, that is, they compare
the estimated image with the HR original one.
Although this approach works well on simulated
problems, it can not be applied on real ones, where
the HR original image - the reference - isnt available.
Therefore, we have changed the parameter to
choose the final result of the algorithm. Instead of
electing the best image, the one computed in the
last iteration is defined as the final estimated one.
We investigate such results using SSIM and PSNR
as quality metrics. Good results indicate that it
is possible to use the algorithm on real situations.

Methods

The results presented in this paper were obtained using a modified version of the software
developed according to the algorithms in Babacan et al. (2011) Villena et al. (2013), Nascimento and Salles (2015), and Villena et al.
(2010).

<httpdecsai.ugr.espisuperresolution> and it
was released on July 7th, 2015.

Different noises, SR methods and convergence
conditions were tested. Regarding the noise, it is
always gaussian with zero mean, but its variance
changes with the LR images SNR (signal-to-noise
ratio), whose values vary among 1, 5, 10, 20 and
25 db. As for the SR methods, we tested TV,
1 -norm, SAR, 1 SAR and TVSAR. Finally, the
convergence conditions are MSE-based and SSIMbased, respectively, MSE(xj1 , xj )xj1 2 <
105 and SSIM(xj1 , xj ) > 0.9999. For both inequations xj1 is the estimated image of the previous iteration and xj is the estimated image of
the current iteration.
For each one of the simulations, we had chosen
the image estimated at the last iteration. Regarding such estimated image, we registered its PSNR
and SSIM values. Besides, the execution time and
number of iterations of each simulation were also
registered. Therefore, we compare the algorithm
with both convergence conditions in terms of quality and speed.

Experimental Results

Each type of experiment, according to the noise,
SR methods and convergence condition, was executed six times one for each HR image. The
average SSIM values were calculated to show the
differences between the five SR methods. We can
remark that, for both convergence conditions, the
results are similar. In Figures 4 (SSIM-based convergence) and 5 (MSE-based convergence) we can
see that the presence of SAR increases the quality,
especially for lower SNR values (10 db and below),
i.e, when the noise is more intense. We can also
notice that the combination of TV and SAR (85
TV + 15 SAR) provides bad results, in contrast
to the results given by the 1 SAR combination.
The average execution time is available at Table 1. Such values are separated per original HR
image ,due to the strong relationship between execution time and dimension. The images boats and
cameraman present the highest values of execution time and they both have 256256 dimension.
On the other hand, the images named card and
EIAcen120 are the smallest ones with 120120
pixels and present, on average, the fastest results.

SSIM

Our experiments are synthetic, i.e. the LR
images are generated from a given HR original
image, in order to use the quality metrics PSNR
and SSIM. The six images in Figure 3 were used
as original HR images. We generate the LR images using the model in Equation 1, as the following parameters. The blurring mask is a mean
filter, that is, hk is a 3  3 matrix with all elements equal to 19. The displacement vectors are
l  0 , 3 , 3 , 5 , 5 , ck  0, 0, 0.5, 1, 0 and
dk  0, 0.5, 0, 0, 1. Five LR images were generated for each case, L  5, and the down sampling
scale is P  2.

Figure 6 shows the comparison between SSIM
and time improvement. The SSIM-based convergence, opposed to the MSE-based one, provides
faster results in 99.33 of the cases. This means
that, from 150 experiments we had run, only one
of them was slower than the respective one with
MSE-based convergence. Such loss of time is evaluated in 9.52 of the MSE execution time (3.73
seconds). The yellow square on the bottom-left
quadrant in Figure 6(d) represents this experiment, which was executed with image EIAcen120.
Moreover, the average time improvement, con-

ISSN 2525-8311

cerning all 150 experiments, is 57.19.
In Figures 6(a) and 6(b) it is clear that changing the convergence to SSIM promotes a bigger
time improvement when using SAR and 1 SAR, in
these cases, with more intense noise. The same behavior is noticed in Figure 6(c), but not so clearly.
The quality improvement - measured by SSIM
- happens in 56.67 of the cases. The correlation between the two sets of data (SSIM value of
MSE-based convergence and SSIM value of SSIMbased convergence) is 0.9913. This result is shown,
graphically, in Figure 7.

Conclusions

We have investigated a blind method to choose
the resulting estimated image from an iterative superresolution approach with SSIM-based convergence. Previous works choose the best estimated
image according to full reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) metrics, PSNR or SSIM, thus
the original image is needed in such cases. Therefore, those algorithms are not suitable for real situ-

ations. Our algorithm is a modification of an iterative method that uses an SSIM-based convergence
criterion and we compare it to a modification of
a method that uses MSE-based convergence criterion. On both cases we modify the method of
choice to our blind proposition, which is, choosing
the estimated image from the last iteration.
SSIM as FR-IQA metrics is used here only to
compare the results in a objective manner. Besides convergence, we have made some comparisons regarding priors too. 1 SAR and SAR provide better results, with higher SSIM values. They
also provide the biggest time improvement, when
having more intense noise. The experiments we
have carried out show that our method is more
effective in cases with intense noises (10 db and
bellow) and in the presence of SAR.
The SSIM-based convergence method
presents faster results in 99.33 of the cases,
with an average gain of 57.19 in execution time.
The convergence conditions are highly correlated,
in terms of quality. That is, even if quality is not
improved, the SSIM-based convergence method is
worth using due to the improvement in execution
time. Moreover, our method is not only faster as
it is directly applicable to real cases.
We finally conclude that the SSIM convergence condition is a good choice, when choosing
the last image estimated on the last iteration as
the output of the Superresolution algorithm. Such
condition provides faster execution with satisfactory results.
