Abstract This research evaluates the capability of the loop separation control designed for the experimental aircraft X-HALE to
complete a typical HALE mission pattern. The loop separation is a new approach in control design for highly flexible aircraft it
consists in two control loops. An inner loop capable of controlling the shape of the aircraft while it keeps the plant stable. The outer
loop is designed using non-smooth optimization techniques to control rigid body states for commanded speed, sideslip, heading
and altitude. The controller is efficient for completing the flight pattern with low control energy and inside the maneuver requirements while holding the wing strains at a low level.
Keywords control of flexible aircraft, loop separation control, aircraft control, autopilot.

1 Introduction
The development of new technologies and new
goals in aeronautical industry has impulsed the evolution of a new generation of aircraft. The High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) vehicles are the solution to the necessity of suborbital flights to assist the
crescent demand in radio transmissions, atmospheric
research, surveillance, reconnaissance and research.
(Cesnik, 2014).
For the past 30 years, research effort has helped
to improve the capabilities of HALEs, from unmanned examples like the Helios (Noll, 2006) or the
Zephyr (Davey, 2007) to manned vehicles like the
Solar Impulse 2 currently making its first flight
around the world. All these aircraft share same characteristics of having high aspect ratio flexible wings.
The increase of the wing aspect ratio helps to increase aerodynamic efficiency. Which means that
there exists greater lift to drag ratio causing a reduction of fuel consumption. It also makes necessary to
enhance the structural efficiency. This is required to

ISSN 2525-8311

keep the structure as light as possible, however it
must be capable to hold maneuvers and gust loads.
Composite materials are often offered as a solution
for this structural solicitation, but they result in nonlinearities in the structural behavior (Cesnik, 2014).
The mass reduction on the aircraft structure produces a decrease in stiffness of the wing and an increase in flexibility. The increase of flexibility has a
direct effect in the flight dynamics of an aircraft the
rigid body modes of the airplane get closer in frequency to the vibration modes of the structures. The
model could couple inducing limit cycle oscillation or
even flutter.
HALEs missions are usually designed to be long
term, which require control efficiency to ensure autonomous operation with little or without human intervention. Control laws installed on the aircraft must
be able to adapt to different flight patterns and atmospheric conditions. The control law has to be implemented on board the aircraft. This means that simplicity of the controller is a requirement of the control
project (Nickol, 2007).
A typical HALE mission profile is shown in Figure 1. The vehicle takes off, then it climbs to the

transit altitude at optimum speed, then it travels to the
mission area. Once it gets to the observation point, it
starts a reconnaissance flight around the target. When
the observation time has finished, the airplane returns
to the base at its optimum transit altitude and speed,
descent and land (Nickol, 2007).
Normally, control laws are designed based in the
rigid body approximation of the aircraft flight dynamics. The flexibility of the wing changes the flight dynamics characteristic of the aircraft, which makes this
approximation invalid.

Since 2011, the Active Aeroelasticity and Structures Research Laboratory of the University of Michigan (UMich) has been developing X-HALE, an experimental representative highly flexible aircraft. This
is a radio-controlled testbed used to validate structural models, to study flexible aircraft flight dynamics
and lately in cooperation with Laboratory of New
Concepts in Aeronautics (LNCA) of Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica new flight control laws.
Recently, a linear control of highly flexible aircraft based on loop separation has been developed to
guarantee control and maneuverability of the XHALE (González, 2016). The objective of the work
presented herein is to evaluate the capability of this
control architecture to complete a typical HALE mission pattern.

ment of the markers. During post-processing is possible to obtain the deflection of the wing. The objective
of this platform is to offer information to validate
coupled models of flight and aeroelastic dynamics and
control laws for flexible aircraft (Pang, 2014).
X-HALE is unstable in dutch roll when the movable central fin is flipped horizontally. Because of the
risk involved in the operation of the aircraft, Risk
Reduction Vehicle (RRV) was projected. This is a
lightly instrumented platform to familiarize the pilot
and understand the flight behavior of the aircraft. The
model used in this research represents the RRV.
Structure is modelled using two flexible elements
for each of the inboard one-meter panels. The outboard panels are modelled with four flexible elements.
Horizontal stabilizers have two elements each.
Booms, tails and central pods are modelled using rigid elements. Wings, fins and stabilizers represent the
lifting surfaces on the aerodynamic model, while
booms are modelled as non-lifting surfaces.
The linearized model of the X-HALE is of the

2 X-HALE Description and numerical model
X-HALE is a radio-controlled aircraft with 6 m
wingspan and a wing chord of 0.2 m. The outer panels of the wing have a dihedral of 10 degrees. It has
five pods distributed equidistantly on the wing, tail
booms are linked to these pods holding the stabilizers
the aircraft has three ventral fins on the central pods
to increase lateral stability. Pods contain engines and
instrumentation (Cesnik, 2012). Figure 2 presents the
X-HALE.
X-HALE Aeroelastic Test Vehicle (ATV) is the
full-instrumented version of the X-HALE. This
testbed uses a camera system to measure the deformation of the wing in flight. The cameras are installed
on the central pod facing outwards as seen in Fig. 2.
Wings have a set of three pairs of LED (light emitting
diode) markers on each panel. The camera system is
capable to detect the variation of vertical displace-

The structural reference axis x is in the direction
of the wing spam, y is chord wise and z completes the
axes, it is positive upwards. M includes the body rotation rates in the body frame and three-axis body
rates. PG is the position vector in the inertia frame.
There are six inflow associated states with each lifting
surface, represented by m.
Five control surfaces (horizontal stabilizers, TR12, TL1-2 and ailerons Ail) and five engines (F0-4) give
the control input of the X-HALE, as is seen in Fig. 2.

The operation limits of the control surfaces are 30
degrees. The model of the engine is in function of
throttle and aircraft speed. For the nominal speed of
14 ms the maximum thrust of the engine is approximately 5 N.

3 Loop Separation Architecture
Loop separation concept consists in an inner loop
in charge of stabilizing the flexible aircraft and an
outer loop for navigation (González, 2016). The inner
loop must ensure that all poles be on the left side of
the imaginary axis, while resulting in damped response in the time-domain at low control energy. The
high level of deformation and deformation rate has a
huge influence on the flight dynamics of an aircraft.
The inner loop has then the task to keep the steadystate shape of the aircraft while maneuvering or in
face of external disturbances.
The outer-loop is designed with a conventional
compensator approach. The compensators were used
to generate the command inputs for height h, velocity
V, sideslip  and heading angle tracking . Heading
reference is attained commanding a bank angle . The
control law architecture of X-HALE is shown in Figure 3.
3.1 Inner loop
The inner loop is basically a proportional controller acting over measured outputs, which are pitch
angle , angular rates p, q and r, and strains at all six
panels. The measured strains are torsion and bending
strains on the center of each panel.
The control inputs of the inner loop are the two
central stabilizers actuated together for longitudinal
control and the outer elevators and the ailerons for
lateral-directional and structural control
Proportional gains have been scheduled using
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) approach, with
output feedback.
The LQR problem consists in finding a feedback
coefficient matrix K, that given a linear system of Eq.
1 and a control signal u  -Ky, minimizes the magnitude of the performance index Jlqr (Stevens, 2003).

To obtain the gain that minimizes the performance
index Jlqr, it is necessary to solve the three coupled
equations. This makes the solution only iteratively
possible.
If the system is stable, the performance index of
Eq. (5) can be written as

After a stabilizing gain is found minimizing the
maximum real part of the eigenvalues of Ac until it
gets negative, Equation (7) is solved iteratively. The
algorithm would use Eq (7) and Eq. (10). For a given
value of K, the Lyapunov equation is solved for P and
then use P in Eq. (10) to determine Jlqr. It must vary
the elements of K to minimize Jlqr.
The inner loop of X-HALE is presented inside
the red square of Fig. 3. The final gain matrix has a
dimension of 4 by 16 and it is completely coupled.
3.2 Outer-loop
Outer-loop of this control system is in charge of
tracking commanded velocity, heading, sideslip angle
and altitude. The architecture of the outer-loop is
comparable to a classical multivariable approach for
aircraft control design (Stevens, 2003). This approach
allows defining control gains that minimize a performance index over the enclosed structure. The tracking command acts over the system described in Eq. 1.
The performance output is.

This optimization process was accomplished by
fixed structure techniques. Fixed structure is a technique that uses non-smooth optimizers with design
requirements as H constraints in order to provide a
solution usually comparable to a full order H synthesis solution. One of the benefits of this method is the
straightforwardness and order of the structure
(Bompart, 2007).
Apkarian (2014) states that the structure of this
problem matches the form of a traditional H problem. PG is the description of open loop plant in a
state space form. State vector is xa  Rnp, exogenous

Kext is the feedback controller with xk  Rnk, and is
called structured if the matrices Fk, Dk, Gk, Jk depend

The optimization of the gains for the outer-loop
of the X-HALE was done with Systune a modern
control tool available in the Matlab Robust Control
System Toolbox.
The objective of the optimization algorithm is to
tune the parameters of Eq. 20 to enforce the closed
loop stability. Systune solves a multi objective constrained optimization problem with soft and hard constraints of the form

T is the cosensitivity function. The notation Tez
is used to represent the closed-loop map from signal e
to signal z. The goal of Eq. 21 is to minimize the
worst-case cost of the soft constraints while enforcing
the hard constraints and close loop stability (Apkarian, 2014).
Design requirements of the controller are based
on the ability of the aircraft to attain the commanded
reference, while all the requirements of the inner loop
are kept. An iterative process was developed to construct a proper controller. Constrains were applied on
PKext functions, the open loop cut off frequency were
set between 0.25 and 1 radsec to reach the physical
limit of the aircraft actuators, the constraints were
tight until the optimization process was capable to
reach the desired performance
A four-controller configuration was proposed for
the X-HALE. Two central elevators give control input for the velocity controller. The bank angle is controlled with the two outer elevators acting together
differentially. The sideslip angle is regulated with the
differential thrust of the outer engines acting a pair
minus the other, height is commanded with the five
engines together. The structure of the control input
for the outer loop is

Case of study
Case of study consists in a typical HALE mission
pattern for X-HALE with control architecture previously described. The aircraft must take off from the
track and then ascend to 30 m. Once the commanded
altitude is reached, the aircraft must fly leveled to the
target. It must complete an orbital pattern over the
target, the radius of the turn is 275 meters, finally it
returns to the departure area and land.

troller is capable to reduce the aircraft velocity at the
end of the mission.
Heading () is shown in Fig. 5. X-HALE is capable to keep the zero degree orientation commanded
by the reference. When X-HALE reaches the target
area, it completes the orbital pattern performing two
and a half laps over it. Once the observation has been
completed, it returns to the landing area. It is possible
to observe that the heading tends to increase the error
during the final phase. While during the entire mission
the maximum heading error was from +3 to  3.5
degrees. During the landing phase the error increases
to 10 degrees. This represents a 14-meter error respect the expected point of touch down. Nevertheless, during the rest of the mission the error was relatively small.
The sideslip angle was kept during the entire orbital pattern, actually during the turn the error was
below 0.01 degrees. During the ascension the sideslip
varies between -0.5 and 0.4 degrees. The greater error occurs again during the descent and landing when
it grow between -2 and 2.9 degrees.
Figure 6 shows that altitude tracker is capable to
ascend to the commanded height, the maximum overshoot is 3.3  and the stationary state error is less
than 1.5 . Once the mission is finished, the aircraft
is capable to descent and complete the landing

The aircraft takes off when it reaches 14 ms. Due
to the increase of altitude the aircraft loses velocity.
The controller is continuously trying to compensate
this reduction of speed until X-HALE reaches the
operation height. Once the aircraft has reached the 30
m height, the velocity is regained and held. Velocity
has no major variation during turn, and is kept with a
small error with respect to the reference. Once the
aircraft starts the descent it is possible to observe and
increase in speed. At the same time, the aircraft is
commanded to reduce velocity to 12 ms. The con-

capable to reach all commanded references without

Figure 9 shows the variation of bending strains
during the entire flight and the correspondent deformation of the aircraft for different moments of the
mission. It is possible to verify how the strains always
tend to return to the equilibrium condition. The maximum level of the deformation is obtained during the
turn (time steps 60 s and 150 s). After the turn phase,
the strains tend to reduce and the aircraft shape is
now closer to the trimmed shape, as it can be observed at the time step of 220 s. The strain level increases again during the landing, the lack of directional control makes the aircraft slips, which increase
the deformation.

The Outer loop is a fixed-structure controller the

non-smooth technique. The commanded references
were tracked satisfactorily. The loop separation concept shows promising results for its future implementation on board the platform. A landing control system must be designed for increasing appropriate
tracking in this flight phase. It is common in this kind
