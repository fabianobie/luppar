Abstract A new form of solution is developed for the problem of the stochastic optimal regulator of discrete dynamic linear
systems. Initially, using the optimality principle of Dynamic Programming it is shown that the solution to this problem can alternatively be obtained employing optimal linear estimation in each stage or step of discretization. Next, a new controller is obtained, as the result of hypothetically assuming the dynamic_system reversible and analogous to a virtual multistage process with
inverted flux and of treating the solution in an alternative and equivalent form employing optimal linear estimation. This new
controller is a direct discrete sequential one that is, a controller whose gain only depends on past and present information about
the system. To illustrate the method behavior and to allow comparison with a previously developed similar heuristic approach,
preliminary tests are done using the same test problem of satellite attitude_control. The proposed solution is expected to lead to a
more adequate controller to be used in adaptive_control schemes.

solução do problema pode ser obtida de forma alternativa equivalente, pela utilização de estimação linear ótima, em cada estágio
ou ponto de discretização. Em seguida, obtém-se um novo controlador como resultado de hipoteticamente se admitir o sistema
dinâmico reversível e análogo a um processo de múltiplos estágios, que virtualmente evolui no sentido dos tempos decrescentes,
e de se tratar a solução de forma alternativa equivalente pela utilização de estimação linear ótima. Este novo controlador é sequencial direto, isto é, um controlador cujo ganho só depende de informações passadas e presentes do sistema. Para ilustrar o
comportamento do método e para permitir comparação com uma abordagem heurística semelhante, previamente desenvolvida,
testes preliminares são feitos utilizando um mesmo problema teste de controle_de_atitude de satélite. Espera-se que a solução proposta leve a procedimento mais adequado para o emprego em esquemas adaptativos de controle.

Introduction

In the search for an optimized solution of a linear system control problem it is usual the adoption of
a quadratic index of performance. The gains of the
resulting controller for the usual optimal control
approach rely on future system dynamics knowledge.
If Dynamic Programming (e.g., Bryson and Ho,
1975) principle of optimality and parameter optimal
linear estimation (e.g., Jazwinski, 1970) are applied it
can be shown that the optimal control can be equivalently determined in each stage. Though with this
approach a stochastic meaning of the inverse of covariance matrices is given to the weight matrices, the
characteristic of relying on future system dynamic
knowledge still remains. This is a serious limitation
in the most common situations where the linear dynamics is only a local approximation of the dynamical behavior of the system and where adaptive
schemes are necessary.
In this work a new sequential controller applicable to discrete linear systems is proposed which
has the distinctive characteristic of having the generation of gains only dependent on past and present
system information. Based on the fact that the transition matrix does always have an inverse, the discrete
linear system is viewed as a process of multiple stagISBN 978-85-8001-069-5

es in the reversed sense. If the Dynamic Programming principle of optimality is applied, it is again
possible to formally treat the control action determination in a typical stage as a problem of parameter
optimal linear estimation. However, this can now can
be done in the sense of progressing time, i.e., such as
to have a direct sequential controller.
The new and original version presented is inspired and related to a previous work (Rios Neto and
Cruz, 1990) in which a regulator type of controller
also capable of operating in the direct and sequential
form was heuristically proposed. This present version
reconsiders, reviews and updates a previous preliminary version (Rios Neto, 1990) in a renewed effort of
establishing theoretical basis for other previous heuristic approaches adopted to synthesize adaptive
controllers applied to ship control (Rios Neto and
Cruz, 1985) and satellite control (Ferreira et al,
1985). If it is considered the interpretation of modeling control actions magnitude and deviations in state
or output as dispersions using variances, then the
new controller proposed is related to minimum variance controllers (e.g. Li and Evans, 1997, 2002
Kharrat et al, 2010) and to predictive control
schemes where Kalman filtering is used to estimate
the control actions (e.g. Silva and Rios Neto, 2000
Silva, 2000 Silva and Rios Neto, 2011).

In what follows, section 2 presents the formulation and usual form of solution of the problem as
presented in Bryson and Ho (1975). In section 3, the
proposed approach is developed, keeping the use of
Bryson and Ho (1975) notation. In order to allow
comparison of performance with a similar approach,
section 4 presents results of preliminary tests using
the same problem of satellite attitude_control as in
Rios Neto and Cruz (1990). Finally, in section 5 a
few conclusions are drawn.

The optimal control problem of Equations (1)
and (3) of previous section can be viewed and treated
considering a correspondent process of multiple
stages as in Figure 1, where each stage corresponds
to a step of discretization (Eq. (1)).

The objective is to control the system to get x(i) as
close to zero as possible, according to a given strategy, as, for example, that of minimizing the criterion

The solution has the same structural form as
that of the correspondent deterministic problem
where there is a perfect knowledge of the state. The
difference is that the control action is calculated
using the value of the best estimate of the state, as
given by the Kalman filter. The difficulties with this
solution are those related to (i) the choice of the
weight matrices S(n), A(i), B(i), (ii) the fact that the
gains ( ) depend on information which have to be
generated from final to present time, complicating its
application to the control of time variant systems
with modeling errors.

The optimal control problem can then be solved
considering the principle of certainty-equivalence,
using the optimality principle of Dynamic Programming. With this approach, the optimal control can be

Dynamic Programming Approach
Consider now the system of multiple stages of
Figure 2, where it is assumed the hypothetical and
virtual situation, in which the evolution of the states
( ) is considered in a reverse sense, from final to
initial state. Though a hypothetical and virtual situation, this is numerically possible in the case of discretized linear dynamic_systems, due to the fact that
the transition matrix does always have an inverse.

5. Preliminary Testing
For the sake of comparison, the example taken
for preliminary testing is the same as in Rios Neto
and Cruz (1990). It is based on a model of doublegimbaled momentum wheel for the attitude_control of
a geostationary satellite, as given in Kaplan (1976).
The satellite has the following characteristics mass
of 716 kg moments of inertia IxIz2000 N.m.s2,
Iy400 N.m.s2  nominal wheel momentum of 200
N.m.s and orbital frequency of 7.28E-05 rads. It is
equipped with sensors capable of observing roll and
pitch with accuracy of 5.8E-05 rad as expressed by
their standard deviations. The satellites axes x, y, and
z are respectively in correspondence with roll, pitch
and yaw the wheel axis coincides with the y axis. In
discrete-time form, based on a discretization time
interval of 0.1 s, the state model is as follows

To avoid near singularity numerical behavior, in
analogy with what is done in state estimation with
the addition of process noise, the diagonal terms of
the matrix  ( ) (Eq. (54)) were saturated from
below as follows

6. Conclusions
Under ideal simulation conditions of perfect
knowledge of state and no process perturbations, the
results obtained with the proposed controller are
quite satisfactory, as depicted in Figures 3 and 4. The
controller response could be taken in the limit of the
control action capacity for the problem at hand,
reaching a condition of satisfactory errors levels (of
the order of magnitude of 1.E-05 rad in roll and yaw,
1.E-06 rad in pitch, and angles rates below 5.E-05
rads).

A new optimal direct sequential regulator for
discrete linear systems was developed. It is optimal
in the sense of minimizing a quadratic index of performance in the deviation errors relative to a desired
dynamic_system trajectory. It is direct and sequential
in the sense that the gains to calculate control actions
are obtained in each progressing time step.
Using the Dynamic Programming principle of
optimality, it was first shown that employing a formally equivalent estimation approach a solution can
be obtained which is identical to the usual Maximum
Principle optimal solution. With this approach, a

66

Anais do XIX Congresso Brasileiro de Automática, CBA 2012.

stochastic meaning was attached to the weight matrices in the index of performance. It was concluded
that control actions order of magnitude and accepted
deviations in state can be interpreted as dispersions
using variances.
Assuming the dynamic_system reversible and
analogous to a virtual multistage process with inverted flux, the same approach was then used to develop
a direct discrete sequential regulator. The resulting
controller is one where the gain depends only on past
and present information about the system and where
the desired behavior of the controlled state is prescribed one step ahead. The minimization of control
action and of state deviation as a formally equivalent
problem of optimal estimation allowed again to interpret the weight matrices as error covariance matrices and to empirically use formally equivalent noise
process to compensate for the bad numerical behavior in the calculations of the control gain. Thus, this
formal equivalence opens the possibility of using
results already available in state estimation to improve the numerical performance of the developed
controller.
The preliminary test results are encouraging.
The fact that the control strategy can be established
by prescribing a virtual state one step ahead and that
future system dynamics knowledge is not needed to
calculate the present control action makes this controller suitable for application on nonlinear_systems
control where linearized and discrete local approximations can be used combined with adaptive
schemes.
