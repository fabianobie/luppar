Abstract This paper investigates the local stability of a quantized state feedback control law for nonlinear quadratic discretetime systems considering a static finite-level logarithmic quantizer. The sector bound approach together with a relaxed stability
notion are applied to derive an LMI based method to estimate a set of admissible initial states and its attractor in a neighborhood
of the system origin assuming that a state feedback controller and a quantizer are given a priori. More specifically, the proposed
conditions will ensure that all state trajectories starting in the first set will converge to the attractor in a finite time and they will
never leave it. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the proposed stability analysis.

Resumo Este trabalho investiga a estabilidade local de uma lei de controle por realimentação_de_estados para um sistema não
linear quadrático em tempo_discreto sujeito a quantização considerando um quantizador estático logarítmico com níveis finitos de
quantização. A abordagem via condição_de_setor juntamente com uma noção de estabilidade relaxada são aplicadas na obtenção
de condições baseadas em desigualdades_matriciais_lineares (LMIs) para se estimar um conjunto de estados inicias admissíveis
e um atrator na vizinhança da origem do espaço_de_estados, supondo que o controlador e o quantizador são conhecidos. Mais
especificamente, as condições propostas asseguraram que todas as trajetórias dos estados que se iniciam no primeiro conjunto
convergem para o atrator em tempo finito e permanecerão confinadas a esse conjunto. Exemplos numéricos são apresentados para
demonstrar a metodogologia proposta.

Introduction

lization problem via state or output feedback control
for logarithmic quantized feedback systems, Fu and
Xie (2005) have introduced the sector bound approach
in which it has been shown that classical tools of robust control theory can be applied with no conservativeness to deal with quantized systems. Since then,
the sector bound approach has been applied to solve
a variety of problems such as, quantized robust control of linear uncertain systems (Fu and Xie, 2010),
state estimation with quantized measurements (Fu and
de Souza, 2009), and local stability analysis of control systems with a static finite-level quantizer (de
Souza et al., 2010). The majority of these results assumes that the plant and the controller are precisely
described by linear models. To date, few works have
addressed the stability and stabilization problems of
quantized nonlinear feedback systems excepting, for
instance, the works of Liu and Elia (2004), De Persis (2005), Liberzon and Hespanha (2005), Liu et al.
(2012b) and Liu et al. (2012a), which only consider
nonlinear continuous-time systems. To the authors
knowledge, the study of finite-level logarithmic quantized nonlinear discrete-time control systems has not
yet been sufficiently addressed in the literature.

Networked control systems (NCS) have been attracting significant interest of the control community
motivated by the fact that new technologies on sensing, computing and wireless communication are bringing about a new range of emerging control applications (Hespanha et al., 2007 Schenato et al., 2007).
When dealing with a shared communication link, a
common situation is to use quantized information to
limit the channel bandwidth. However, the effects of
quantization errors cannot be neglected at the cost of
an inadequate closed-loop performance and even the
lost of stability. Thus, the study of quantized feedback
systems is a topic of great relevance in the area of networked control systems. For instance, Elia and Mitter (2001) have shown for a quadratically stabilizable
system that a logarithmic quantizer (i.e., the quantization levels are linear in a logarithmic scale) is the optimal solution in terms of coarse quantization density.
In addition, logarithmic quantizers can achieve superior dynamic range for a given number of bits (Rasool
et al., 2012). A major drawback on this approach is
that the optimal solution requires an ideal logarithmic
quantizer (i.e., a quantizer with an infinite number of
levels). To overcome this problem, Fu and Xie (2009)
have proposed a finite-level quantizer combined with
a dynamic scaling factor, but this approach requires
some intelligence of the network communication devices.

A classical solution to overcome the mathematical complexity of dealing with nonlinear dynamics
is to consider a linear approximation of the systems
around an operating point (via Taylor expansion), and
then apply the well-established linear control tools.
When the linear approximation is inadequate to represent the nonlinear dynamics, one may consider high-

order terms of the Taylor expansion such as bilinear
models whose nonlinearities appear only in the input channel (Pardalos and Yatsenko, 2008). A natural expansion of bilinear models is obtained by considering the quadratic terms of the Taylor expansion
giving rise to the class of nonlinear quadratic systems (see, e.g., Amato et al. (2007)). It turns out that
quadratic systems can represent a large number of processes as, for instance, induction machines and DCDC converts (Figalli et al., 1984 Fuad et al., 2004),
distillation columns (Espana and Landau, 1978), and
bioprocesses (Kulkarni et al., 2010). For these reasons, the control design for nonlinear quadratic systems (including bilinear models) has attracted recurring interest of control practitioners see, e.g., Amato
et al. (2007), Coutinho and de Souza (2012), and the
references therein.
In this paper, the stability analysis problem of
a quantized state feedback control law for quadratic
nonlinear discrete-time systems considering a static
finite-level logarithmic quantizer on the plant input.
Firstly, we present the notion of wide quadratic stability introduced in de Souza et al. (2010) in the context
of quantized linear systems. Then, we propose an LMI
approach to derive a set of admissible initial states and
an associate attractor set in the vicinity of the system
origin such that all state trajectories starting in the former set will be attracted to the attractor in finite time
and remain inside the latter set. Numerical examples
are presented to demonstrate the potentials of the proposed stability analysis.
Notation Rn denotes the n-dimensional Euclidian space, Rnm is the set of n  m real matrices, In is
the n  n identity matrix, 0n and 0nm are the n  n and
n  m matrices of zeros, respectively. For a real matrix M, M  denotes its transpose, He(M)  M + M  ,
and M > 0 (M  0) means that M is symmetric and
positive-definite (positive semi-definite). For a symmetric block matrix, the symbol  stands for the transpose of the block outside the main diagonal block. Finally, the argument k of x(k) is often omitted.

It is assumed that the pair (A0 , B0 ) is stabilizable and
the unforced system of (1) is allowed to be unstable.
The system in (1) is locally stabilized by a state
feedback controller as follows

In this section, we extend a result derived in Fu

to the stability analysis of quantized state feedback
linear systems with ideal logarithmic quantizers. To
this end, let the feedback system in (1) with (7) under
the assumption that Q() is an ideal static logarithmic

Finally, notice that (14) coincides with the condition for local quadratic stability in X of the uncertain
nonlinear quadratic system (12) with the control law
  K(x)x, which concludes the proof.

Theorem 1 provides a sufficient condition for local quadratic stabilization of a nonlinear quadratic system with a logarithmically quantized quadratic state
feedback control law in which the quantizer has an infinite number of levels. Moreover, the latter stabilization problem is cast in terms of the robust stabilization
problem for a quadratic system with an uncertain parameter in the control input.
4 Local Stability Analysis

  (1)

The result stated in Section 3 is not applicable
to quantized state feedback systems with a (practical)
finite-level logarithmic quantizer. A finite-level quantizer as defined in (9) is a truncated version of the ideal
quantizer with a saturation (largest quantization level)
and a dead-zone (smallest quantization level). Hence,
the asymptotic convergence of the state trajectory towards the system origin (the equilibrium point under
analysis) cannot be in general guaranteed. Nevertheless, we propose in the following LMI based conditions to ensure the convergence in finite time of the
state trajectory (starting in a region of admissible initial conditions) to a small invariant region in the vicinity of the state-space origin.
Firstly, let the closed-loop system of (1) and (7)


x(k+1)  A(x)x(k) + B(x)u(k)




w(k)  K(x)x(k)
(15)





u(k)  Q(w(k)).

Figure 2 Ideal logarithmic quantizer.
Theorem 1 The quantized closed-loop system of (1),
(3) and (7), with Q()  Q(), is locally quadratically
stable in X if the following auxiliary uncertain system
x(k + 1)  A(x)x(k) + B(x)(1 + )(k) ,

(14)

(12)

with (k)  K(x)x(k) is locally quadratically stable in
X for all  satisfying   , where  is as in (10).

Associated to the system (15) and the quantizer
(9), let the following sets

Proof The proof is along the lines of that of Theorem 1 in Fu and Xie (2005). First, note that as for w
given in (3) and the ideal quantizer Q() we have

B  x  Rn  K(x)x  (1),

(16)

C  x  Rn  K(x)x  ,   N1 (1 + ). (17)

u  w  Q(w)  w  f (w)w,

The sets B and C are related to respectively the largest
and smallest quantization levels of the quantizer.
Note that whenever the state x of system (15) lies
in C, one has Q(v(k))  0 and thus the control signal
u applied to the system (15) is zero. Hence, in general, the trajectory of x will not converge to the origin
and thus quadratic stability will not hold. To take this
behavior into account, we introduce in the sequel a
notion of stability which is inspired by the concept of
practical stability proposed by Elia and Mitter (2001).
To this end, let the quadratic functions

where f (w) is unknown and such that  f (w)  , then
the quantized closed-loop system can be written as
(
x(k + 1)  A(x)x(k) + B(x)(1+ f (w))w(k),
(13)
w(k)  K(k)x(k) .
Next, system (13) is locally quadratically stable
in X if there exists a Lyapunov function V(x)  x Px,
with P > 0 such that
DV(x)  V(x(k+1))  V(x(k))

 V A(x)x + B(x)(1+ f (K(x)x))K(x)x  V(x)

Notice that since (x) is affine in x, there exists

this section) such that (x)(x)  0. Replacing (30)
in (28) and applying a version of the Finslers lemma
as in Coutinho et al. (2008), we obtain the following

The above stability notion ensures for any x(0) 
D that the trajectory of x(k) will converge to the set A
in finite time and x(k)  A,  k  k, for some finite integer k > 0. Hence, A is said to be an attractor of D,
and D will be referred to as the set of admissible initial
states. Further, conditions (24) and (25) ensure that C p
is bounded and C p  A, otherwise x(k) could eventually leave A. In addition, observe that Definition 1 is
similar to the notion of practical stability proposed in
(Elia and Mitter, 2001) by setting Pa  P for some
positive  larger than one. Thus, the condition D  X
ensures that D is a positively invariant set.
In order to obtain LMI based conditions to ensure
the wide quadratic stability of the closed-loop system
in (15), firstly observe that the condition DV(x) < 0
can be cast as follows

Next, the set of inequalities in (42) ensures the

In the sequel, it will be shown that (44) and (45)
guarantee that (25) holds. To this end, assume that

In light of the definition of the set C p in (21), notice that if the LMIs in (34) and (36) hold for all x  X
together with (22), then the conditions (23) and (24)
are satisfied.
Now, we are ready to state the following stability
result

 (Pa  (1+3 )A(x) Pa A(x)+4  2 K(x) K(x))  0.

In general, we may desire to obtain a maximized
set D (in the sense of its volume), or a minimized
set A. As the set D is an ellipsoid, a way to approximately maximize its size is to minimize trace(P).
The reason for this is that for P  Rnn we have
n(trace(P))1  trace(P1 ) and trace(P1 ) is the sum
of the squared semi-axis lengths of the ellipsoid D.
Specifically, the size of D in Theorem 2 can be approximately maximized by means of following optimization problem

In order to obtain a stabilizing state feedback control law, the approach proposed in (Coutinho et al.,
2010) assuming an ideal logarithmic quantizer is applied to the linear approximation of system (61) which
has led the following result

Very often, it is desired to jointly optimize the
size of D and A, which is generally difficult to be
achieved. A possible solution to approximately jointly
maximize D and minimize A is obtained by minimizing the scalar   1 2 , where 1 and 2 are as in (49)
and (50), respectively. More specifically, this optimization problem can be formulated as follows. First,
defining

for a minimum quantization density inf  0.333.
Thus, a quantized control law u  Q(w) having a sufficient number of levels (i.e.,  > inf ) stabilizes the
closed-loop system in the sense of Definition 1. Then,
a suitable quantizer can be designed by adapting the

Fig. 3 shows the sets D, A and X. To evaluate the
method conservativeness, it is also plotted in Fig. 3
three state trajectories (two stable and one unstable)
starting very close to the boundary of D. The first stable trajectory starts at x(0)   0 1.7  (inside D) and
the second one at x(0)   0 1.75  which is outside
D. The unstable trajectory starts at x(0)   0 1.8 
which also does not belong to D. A zoomed view of
the starting point of the three state trajectories and the
set D are given on the top of Fig. 3. In addition, a
detailed view of the set A and the terminal part of the
stable trajectories are shown in Fig. 4.

5 Examples
In the following, two numerical examples are considered to illustrate the approach. The first one is
based on the Example 3.1 of Fu and Xie (2005) which
is a non-minimum phase open-loop unstable system
with additional nonlinear terms. The second example is a quadratic system taken from de Souza and
Coutinho (2011) in which the control signal is quantized with a finite-number of quantization levels.

Concluding Remarks

This paper has addressed the local stability analysis problem of single input nonlinear quadratic
discrete-time systems with a quantized state feedback
law. Based on a relaxed stability notion, an LMI based
approach has been derived to estimate a set of admissible initial states and an associated invariant attractor
in a neighborhood of the state-space origin such that
all state trajectories starting in the former set will converge to the attractor in finite time. Numerical examples have demonstrated the potentials of the proposed
approach.

To ascertain the conservatism of the achieved results, Fig. 5 displays the sets D, A and X along with
a stable trajectory (starting at x(0)  1.3  0.8 )
and an unstable one (starting at x(0)  1.3  0.9 ),
which clearly demonstrates the potentials of the proposed local stability analysis method.
