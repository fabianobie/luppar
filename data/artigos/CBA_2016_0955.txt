Abstract In this paper, some results concerned with the control of uncertain switched linear systems using
Lyapunov-Metzler inequalities and properties of Strictly Positive Real (SPR) systems are presented. A practical
implementation is realized with the design of a robust controller, proposed in this paper, based on switched static
state feedback and using Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs), in an active suspension system manufactured by the
Quanser . For the implementation, it is supposed that the active suspension system is subject to uncertainties
in the model. Performance indices such as decay rate and restriction in the norm of controller gains are considered
in the design. The results show an adequate performance and an efficient solution for this control problem.

Introduction

Switched systems are dynamical systems composed of several subsystems switching among
themselves according to a decision rule. This kind
of dynamical systems exist in a variety of engineering applications. An important stability problem
concerning switched systems, that has been studied, is the problem of finding conditions for the existence of a stabilizing switching signal for a given
switched system (DeCarlo et al., 2000). The main
idea of this paper is the design of Variable Structure Controller (VSC) based on the LyapunovMetzler (LM) inequalities proposed by Geromel
and Colaneri (Geromel and Colaneri, 2006) and
the stability properties of the Strictly Positive
Real (SPR) systems. It is known that a linear
time-invariant system is SPR if it satisfies the
following properties. It is a passive system, is
asymptotically stable, and all its transmission zeros have negative real parts. The SPR synthesis
has been studied for various purposes, in the specialized literature is possible to find works that
report its use in Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems such as the design of VSC systems (Teixeira
et al., 2002 Hung et al., 1993), and in the output feedback tracking of uncertain systems (Hsu
et al., 2001).
A sufficient condition to apply the SPR syn-

ISSN 2525-8311

thesis is that, given a LTI plant A, B, C,which
is controllable and observable, find constant matrices F and K0 such that the controlled system
A  BK0 C, B, F C is SPR. For plants with the
number of inputs m equal to the number of outputs p, this problem has solution if and only if all
transmission zeros of the plant have negative real
parts and det(CB)  0 (Owens et al., 1987). The
procedure to solve this problem using Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) can be easily solved with
available software. Moreover, using this tool, we
can consider other design specifications like plant
uncertainties, decay rate (related to the setting
time), and output and input constraints (Teixeira
et al., 2002 Bernussou et al., 1999).
In (Geromel and Colaneri, 2006), a stability
analysis and control design is proposed for the
continuous-time switched linear system given by
x  A(t) x(t), x(0)  x0 , where x(t)  Rn is the
state vector, (t) is the switching control rule, and
x0 is the initial condition. The design of this control law was described as the solution of LM inequalities. This method was applied in the design
of a switching control law of a comfort-oriented
semiactive suspension in road vehicles and a better
performance was obtained when compared with
other available methods (Geromel et al., 2008). In
(Deaecto et al., 2010), it is studied a novel procedure for switched affine systems control design es-

pecially developed to deal with switched converters where the main goal is to attain a set of equilibrium points. More recent researches in this context can be found in (Duan and Wu, 2012 Contzen and Raisch, 2014 Hsu et al., 2015).
This work aims mainly to confirm the good
performance of the proposed methodology in
(Cardim et al., 2016). Thus, a practical implementation was realized in an active suspension
system manufactured by the Quanser , for that,
failures and uncertainties in the plant model were
considered. The computer simulations were carried out by using the software package YALMIP
(Lofberg, 2004), with the solver LMIlab (Gahinet
et al., 1995).

A solution for Problem 1 is proposed in the
next theorem which is an extension of the results
presented for linear time invariant and known systems in (Cardim et al., 2008 Cardim et al., 2011),
now for uncertain switched systems. Furthermore
let us consider an important performance index,
called decay rate. In (Boyd et al., 1994), the decay rate is defined as the largest real constant ,
 > 0 such that
lim et x(t)  0.

LM-SPR Synthesis for Uncertain Switched
Linear Plants

Based in the control synthesis for switched linear systems through the so-called LM-SPR in
(Cardim et al., 2008), let us consider the Problem
1 to describe the proposed synthesis for uncertain
switched linear plants in (Cardim et al., 2016).

The Theorem 1 solves Problem 1 and is a generalization of the method proposed in (Cardim
et al., 2011) for known linear time-invariant
plants. Thus, this result can be useful in the design of switched static state feedback controllers
for uncertain switched plants, based on SPR synthesis. Another performance index that can be
added in the LM-SPR synthesis method, that allows the specification of an upper bound for the
norm of the controller gains, as described later.

The following conditions are sufficient for the solution of Problem 1, with decay rate specification

where Pi  PiT > 0 and the Lyapunov function is
equal to v(x)  xT P x. The idea of the second
stage is the minimization of the time derivative
of the Lyapunov function, through the selection
of the controller gain, which belongs to the set of
gains Kk , k  Kr  where  was obtained in the
first stage. This stage uses auxiliary symmetric
matrices Qik , i  KN , k  Kr and selects an index

Active Suspension System

Consider the active suspension system of a vehicle,
with the schematic model given in Figure 2. This
system is manufactured by Quanser (Figure 3)
(Quanser, 2009). The system consists of a set of
two masses, calls of Ms () and Mus . The Ms
mass represents 14 of the total vehicle body and
is supported by the spring ks and by the damper
bs . The Mus mass corresponds the mass of the
tire set and is supported by the spring kus and
by the damper bus . The vibrations caused by irregularities in the street can be attenuated by the
vehicles active suspension system, represented by
a motor (actuator) connected between the masses
Ms and Mus , and controlled by the force Fc .
The dynamic model can be represented by the
uncertain linear system given in (1), considering

The respective values for the system parameters are shown in Table 1. In the physical model
of the active suspension system there is a payload
mass (brass) removable. It consists of two identical weight units, resulting in the mass Ms ().
Each unit has the weight of 0.4975kg, such that,
the total mass corresponds to the 2.45kg, reported
in the Table 1. Therefore, the Ms mass may assume values between 1.455kg (without the two
weight units) and 2.45kg (with the two weight
units). Thus, the Ms mass may be uncertain and
belongs to the interval 1.455  Ms  2.45(kg).

Conclusions

6

A control design method for continuous-time uncertain switched linear systems using a state feedback switching strategy was proposed in this paper, based on (Cardim et al., 2016). New conditions were obtained and the theory developed is
illustrated through of simulation and implementation in the active suspension control system.
The results obtained with the proposed method
showed adequate performance.

It is important to mention that the presence
of the offset, showed in Figure 7, in spite of the
adequate behavior of the response signal, is due to
the nonlinearities that occur in the real model of
the active suspension system, such as friction and
dead band. In this case, the possibility of improving the calibration and study the nonlinearities of
the system can be considered. This subject is suggested for a future research.
