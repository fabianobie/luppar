Abstract Harvesting management is often affected by uncertainties such as those regarding the assessment
of stock levels and the growth dynamics of commercially exploited fisheries. Previous works have pointed this out
and developed management techniques aimed at minimizing the effects uncertainties have on fisheries management. In this paper we propose to use the CVIU  Control Variation Increases the Uncertainties  approach,
developed to control uncertain stochastic systems, to the harvesting problem. Numerical simulations show the
proposed CVIU approach performs better than the LQG approach in scenarios with large uncertainties.

Introduction

According to reports from the Fisheries Department of the Food and Agriculture Organization of
the United Nations FAO (2014) and nature conservation groups such as WWF, the fraction of
world fisheries harvested at an unsustainable rate
has increased in the last decades. An all time
high of 32.5 overfished commercial stocks was
observed in 2008, followed by a slight decrease to
28.8 in 2011. In the same year about 61.3 of
the stocks were fully fished while the underfished
stocks accounted for 9.9. Meanwhile the world
per capita apparent fish consumption increased
from an average of 9.9kg in the 1960s to 18.9kg
in 2010.
These numbers highlight the importance of
studying optimal fisheries management techniques
which take the conservation of fish stocks into account, as studied in Clark and Kirkwood (1996),
Roughgarden and Smith (1996) and Sethi et al.
(2005) as a few samples. As a matter of fact,
many governments around the world actively seek
to maintain the fisheries harvest within a sustainable range, usually through the use of seasonal
harvesting quotas. However, as previously pointed
out in Roughgarden and Smith (1996), uncertainties regarding the modeling and monitoring of fisheries dynamics may make the use of such harvest

ISSN 2525-8311

quotas ineffective. As an example, Roughgarden
cites the case of Newfoundlands cod fishery collapse Walters and Maguire (1996). Even though
the harvesting quotas set by Canadas fishery authorities were obeyed by Newfoundlands fishers,
the fishery still collapsed  as of 2015, the cod
stocks in the area have not yet rebounded. In
Brazil, according to a study published by the Ministry of Environment MMA (2006), in the early
2000s 80 of the main fisheries were fully exploited, overfished or in recovery process. A loose
inspection of the harvest of fisheries in the Brazilian coast and a lack of coordination between distinct government agencies responsible for the implementation of fishing policies1 has aggravated
the overfishing of Brazilian stocks.
As stressed in the works of Roughgarden and
Smith (1996) and of Sethi et al. (2005), environmental variability, inadequate estimation of
stock sizes and managerial uncertainty Sethi et al.
(2005) are possible causes of the collapse of the
canadian cod and other fisheries. These au1 As reported in Azevedo and Pierri (2014), in 2011 the
Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture issued new sardine
fishing licences even though a previous decree by IBAMA,
the Brazilian Institue of Environment and Renewable Resources, forbade the admittance of new sardine fishing
boats. Within the 2010 mullet fishing season, despite
IBAMA advocating the licensing of 60 fishing boats, the
Ministry authorized 89 licences.

thors propose therefore harvest management techniques which aim to deal with such uncertainties. Sethi et al. (2005) design a model comprising the three sources of uncertainties mentioned
before, whereas Roughgarden and Smith (1996)
argue for a shift of the optimal harvesting point,
as follows. Using the logistic function as a model
for the growth of the fish biomass, Z(t), we have
dZ(t)  (r (1  Z(t)K) Z(t)  h(t)) dt, where K
is the environment carrying capacity. The maximum sustainable yield (MSY) then corresponds
to Z(t)  K2, however, this is an unstable equilibrium point and, as shown in Roughgarden and
Smith (1996), unexpected shocks to the environment or demand may cause the fishery to collapse.
Hence the paper proposes fisheries to be exploited
at Z(t)  3K4, which provides lower immediate
financial return but increases the stability of fish
stocks.
We can therefore conclude that a sustainable fisheries management plan should include the
analysis of uncertainties affecting the model chosen to portray the fish stock dynamics as well
as the difficulties in implementing the desired actions. In this sense, the problem of fishery management with uncertain model is seen here as the
problem of managing a renewable resource with
poorly known growth dynamics, subject to an also
badly known consumption rate. We assume the
growth is (roughly) described by a logistic model
with poorly known characteristic parameters. A
control technique that fits in the scenario is the
CVIU  acronym for Control Variations Increase
the Uncertainties  approach, developed in Souto
et al. (2013) and aimed at dealing with uncertain
stochastic systems.
The paper is organized as follows. In section
2 we present an overview of growth models used
in harvesting theory and, in section 3, a summary
of the CVIU model. These concepts are applied
to an optimal harvesting problem in 4, followed
by numerical examples in 5 and a summary of the
main findings in section 6.

Growth modelling

The growth of a single species population, as observed in nature, often presents an exponential
trait, which has led to the modeling of growth
of biological populations as an exponential process. The rate at which the population grows,
however, is not constant Murray (2002). Due to
a limited availability of supplies in the environment, the population dynamics resembles a selflimiting process as the population size approaches
the so called environmental carrying capacity and
the growth rate slows down as the population size
increases. Based on these observations, the logistic, Richards and Gompertz functions are often
used to approximate the dynamic evolution of a

ISSN 2525-8311

single species population.
Denote the biomass amount at a time instant
by Z(t) and suppose the population at the same
time is harvested at a rate h(t) and the fishery
manager estimation of the current stock size is
affected by a random disturbance. We have, according to the logistic function,


 
Z(t)
Z(t)  h(t) dt + dW (t)
dZ(t)  r 1 
K
(1)
in which K  0 is the carrying capacity of the
environment, usually determined by the available
resources Murray (2002), and r  0, the slope of
the curve at Z  0, is the intrinsic growth rate. In
a similar fashion, the Gompertz equation is given
by




K
Z(t)  h(t) dt + dW (t)
dZ(t)   log
Z(t)
(2)
Both Gompertz and logistic functions exhibit
a dependence of the growth rate on the population
size, as previously noted. The Gompertz equation,
however, does not display the symmetry in growth
seen in the logistic function.

Dealing with stochastic uncertainties
the CVIU approach

In du Pin et al. (2009), Souto et al. (2013), and
Souto (2015), a strategy for controlling uncertain
stochastic systems based on the idea that the Control Variation Increases the Uncertainties is analysed. According to these ideas, for a class of systems with highly uncertain nonlinear dynamics, it
is reasonable to assume that, due to the limited
knowledge about the system dynamics, a control
action may lead the system to a region in the state
space in which the uncertainty regarding the real
state of the system may be even higher. Moreover, for some systems, specially in biology and
economics, such as the one studied here or in economic dynamics Brock et al. (2007), it is not
possible or reasonable to carry out experiments
in order to attain a more accurate description of
the system dynamics.
Within this framework the authors introduce
the idea of a random disturbance term modulated
by the intensity of the control variation Souto
et al. (2013), which was later generalized to include disturbances modulated by deviations of the
system state from the equilibrium point Souto and
do Val (n.d.).
In this sense, we assume that the dynamics
of the system we wish to control is described by
a stochastic differential equation, as in Souto and
do Val (n.d.)
dZ(t)  G(t, Z, v)dt + (t)dW (t)

(3)

3301

for which W  W (t) is a Brownian motion defined over the probability space (, F, Ft , P ),
G(t, Z, v) a nonlinear function and the control
strategy v  v(t)t0 a Ft -adapted stochastic
process taking its value in a compact set U  R.
Moreover, supposing the system operates around
an equilibrium point (Ze , ve ), G is differentiable at
(Ze , ve ) and substituting for the variations x(t) 
Z(t)Ze and u(t)  v(t)ve , we can approximate
the system dynamics by a local linear model
dZ(t)  dX(t)  (Ax(t) + Bu(t))dt + (t)dW (t)
Now suppose we deal with an uncertain system from which only a rough model is available.
Souto and do Val (n.d.) model the uncertainties regarding the operational model through extra noise terms dependending on the state and
control action. In the scalar case, this leads to
dX(t)  (Ax(t) + Bu(t))dt + dW (t) + ( x +
 x x(t))dW x (t) + ( u +  u u(t))dW u (t) (4)
where A and B are scalars and W x (t), W u (t) are
one-dimensional Brownian motions.
As shown in Souto and do Val (n.d.), the performance of the controller on an interval 0  s <
T , with T fixed, is measured by the expected value
of a criterion of Bolza type

Consider the optimal control problem over an
infinite time horizon, a discounted quadratic running cost and assume the system matrices A, B as
well as the drift coefficients , u ,  u , x ,  x are
time invariant. The linearized stochastic control
problem can be formulated as

where

(7)

Moreover we consider x  0. Dynamic programming leads to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
equation

The Hamiltonian function depends on the absolute values of the control u(t) and state x(t). It
is therefore not differentiable, however, as shown
in Souto et al. (2013) and Souto and do Val (n.d.),
the optimal control sign can be determined. This
leads to the division of the state space into three
distinct regions R+ (t), R (t) and R0 (t) in which
the optimal control variation is greater, less than
or equal to 0. The region R0 (t), in which the optimal control strategy is to keep the current control
action unchanged, brings up the idea of a precautionary control and is known as the inaction
region.
Inside the inaction region, the optimal control
action in the linearized model is equal to 0 and the
optimal cost function V  (x) is given by

where X is the solution of the modified Lyapunov

In the scalar case, we assume the cost function

Optimal Harvesting

As shown in section 3, to use the strategy presented in Souto et al. (2013) we need a linearized
model of the system to be controlled. Linearize
the equations (1) and (2) around an equilibrium
point (Ze , he ), substitute for the variations x(t) 
Z(t)  Ze and u(t)  h(t)  he and add the random terms of the CVIU approach. For the logistic
function this leads to

(19)
Adopt for the controller performance a
quadratic discounted cost  suppose the operator
wishes to minimize the control effort while striving to maintain the system around the equilibrium
point  over an infinite time horizon. The optimal stochastic control problem can be stated as
Z 

min E
et Qx(t)2 + Hu(t)2 dt
(20)

s.t. dX(t)  F (x(t), u(t))dt + (t)dW (t) (21)
where F (x(t), u(t)) is replaced by (18) or (19) according to the chosen growth model.
With the corresponding CVIU models we can
calculate a control strategy as presented in Section 3. In the scalar case, the optimal CVIU
cost function is symmetric with respect to the origin. For the right half plane we have u  0 and
V0 (x)  s0 x2 + p0 x + l0 in the inaction region,
which extends from x  0 to the boundary point
x  xb . In a similar fashion, from a large enough
x onward the asymptotic solution for the cost
function (15) is valid and the optimal control action w.r.t. the CVIU problem is given by (17).

ISSN 2525-8311

Between these two points the optimal cost function is the solution of the nonlinear differential
equation (8). An exact solution to this equation
has not been found, therefore an approximation
to the second derivative of the cost function and
an order reduction are employed to solve equation (8) numerically in this interval. This procedure, as shown in Souto and do Val (n.d.), leads
to residual values of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
equation with relative error magnitude of 1015 .

Numerical Computation

In this section we present numerical examples related to uncertainties such as those discussed in
Section 1 and apply the CVIU controller to verify how it performs in harvest scenarios with large
uncertainties. The performance of the proposed
control strategy is then compared to the optimal
LQG controller tuned to the estimated system dynamics. The actual system, as described by (1), is
simulated through Monte Carlo evaluations with
50 repetitions and a time horizon of 200 seconds.
The stochastic differential equation (1) is numerically computed by the Euler-Maruyama method
as presented in Higham (2001). The harvested
population is assumed to have a logistic (1) growth
with parameters K  100 and r  0.3 operating
around an equilibrium point xe  3 K
4 as proposed
in Roughgarden and Smith (1996).
We analyze how the system behaves when the
parameters available to the controller differ from
the ones of the actual system and in the presence
of a stochastic disturbance given by a Brownian
motion with diffusion coefficient . For that we,
as proposed in Souto et al. (2013), evaluate the
performance of the controller as the mismatch  
A0  A between the original system parameter A0
and the estimated value A increases. The relative
gain of the CVIU control cost w.r.t. the LQG
controller is shown in Figure 1 as the parameters
 x and u  uu vary. Here a maximum gain of
13.75 is observed after the simulations.
We also simulate how fluctuations in the stock
levels, modulated by the diffusion coefficient ,
impact on the controllers performance. For that
we assume there is a 20 difference between the
parameter A of the local linearized system and
the estimate available to the controller. Results
are shown in Figure 2. In both cases,   1 or
  2, a maximum gain of about 14 of the CVIU
controller is observed.
Following the arguments of Roughgarden and
Smith (1996) and Sethi et al. (2005), we next
evaluate how measurement errors affect the controlled harvest. The stock level assessment error
was modeled as a random variable with uniform
distribution 1, 1+ which is multiplied by the
actual stock level. In Table 1 the relative gains of
the CVIU approach when compared to the LQG

As presented in the works Sethi et al. (2005)
and Roughgarden and Smith (1996), another uncertainty source consists of harvest implementation errors. Moreover, examples such as those of
the Canadian cod collapse and the disagreements
between different government agencies Azevedo
and Pierri (2014) reinforce the perception that an
evaluation of a possible mismatch between the attempted and the actual harvest is needed. Hence
we simulate how the controlled system reacts to
such disturbances. Similarly to the previous simulation, the attempted control action is multiplied
bu a random variable with uniform distribution
1  , 1 + . Simulation results are shown in Table 2.
The numerical results presented in Tables 1
and 2 show the CVIU controller, when calibrated
by the parameters  x and u , performs better
than the traditional LQG controller in the aforementioned scenarios, which were thought so as to
mirror the uncertainties in the fisheries management literature.

Conclusion

In this paper we study how to manage renewable
resources when there is limited knowledge about
their dynamics. This is a topic of growing concern
worldwide and, specially in the case of fisheries,
uncertainties arise often in this class of problems,
as pointed out by Roughgarden and Smith (1996),
Sethi et al. (2005) and others.
The numerical results presented in Section
5 show that the CVIU approach yields better
performance than the traditional LQG controller
when large uncertainties affect the simulated system. Therefore we believe the CVIU approach can
contribute to the study of fisheries management.
Moreover, numerical computation presented in
Souto and do Val (n.d.) show that the CVIU approach performs better than the LQG controller
also in multidimensional systems. This let us speculate that the approach presented here can be extended to the harvesting problem of multi-species
ecosystems.
In the harvest literature, a topic of concern
is the evaluation of extinction risks of the har-

such as that of the Canadian cod Roughgarden
and Smith (1996),Walters and Maguire (1996).
Possible lines of future work include therefore the
simulation of collapse risks when fisheries are under a CVIU controller and comparison with methods from the fisheries management literature.
