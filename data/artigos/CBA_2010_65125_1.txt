Introduction

Nowadays, automobile companies are involved in
the design of more efficacious vehicles to improve
the energetic efficiency. To this end and in order
to improve the traffic in the cities, the design of
smaller vehicles with a better weightload ratio is
widely reported, see for instance (Achmore, 2006),
(Johannsen and et al., 2003), (Gehre et al., 2001),
(Brink and Kroonen, 2004), (Gohl et al., 2006).
This is the subject of a project in course in the
Universidade Federal de de Santa Catarina(Brazil). Specifically the aim of the project is the design of a three wheeled narrow vehicle for two passengers (Vieira et al., 2009).Due to the narrowness, such vehicles have stability problems that
uses to be avoided allowing the vehicle to lean in
curves, as a motorcycle. This strategy has been
used in several concept vehicles, for instance Mercedes Benz - F 300 Life-Jet, General Motors
- Lean Machine, BMW Clever and Simpleand
one production vehicle, Carver by VanderBrink.

2.1

The three wheels tiltable vehicle
The model

This work starts from the tilting tricycle model
of six degrees of freedom reported by Vieira, Roqueiro and Nicolazzi (Vieira et al., 2009). Three extra degrees of freedom were added to allow modelling independent vertical movements of
each wheel. In addition, two perturbations, lateral wind and road roughness, were taken into
account.
The vehicle consists of a central mass (body 2)
and three wheels, two located in the front (bodies
3 and 4) and one in the rear (body 1). The origin of the coordinate system is the contact point
of the rear wheel with the road and the clockwise
convention is assumed (Figure 1).The three wheels are assumed to be always in contact with the
ground.
In this frame, the velocity of each of the masses is worked out. It results in a model of nine
degrees of freedom with positions and velocities
described as

The purpose of the authors is to design a controller able to tilt the vehicle through the steering angle manipulation. The controller must act
transparently to the driver and ensure the optimum angle to improve safety and performance.
An appropriate tracking controller is synthesized in the framework of Sliding Mode Control
(Utkin, 1978). In this first approach the switch

 Rotation of the body 2 with respect to an axis
parallel to Y axis (). This is due to a movement of body 2 (not punctual) with respect
to its own rotation center which will be considered to be placed in its mass center. The
rotation around its transverse axis causes a
movement that interferes in the behaviour of
the front and rear suspensions. As for bodies 1, 3 and 4, the angular movements with
respect its own axis will not be considered because they do not interfere in the movement
of other bodies.

Velocities formulation

Using the variables, the sign convention and the
coordinate system described in the former subsection, the velocity of each of the bodies can be formulated.
From the velocities depicted in Figure 2, the
equation of the linear and angular velocities of
body 1 can be written as,

For better analyzing the controller performance, it

velocity. They result in limits on the vehicle tilting. The relation between velocities and turn radii where stated following the Departamento Nacional de Estradas de Rodagem norm, that defines
the pattern for building roads in Brazil.

Minimum curvature radii for different velocities and track superelevation (SE) values are
shown in table 1. The limit values considered in
this work are those referred to 4, because the
computational model does not reflect track superelevation. Curve radius can be mapped into
the vehicle front wheels turning angle through
equation (19),

Lagrange equation in matrix form

As in (Leal et al., 2008) using the Lagrangian formulation a second order vector dynamics can be
written as

Statement of the control problem
Vehicle maximum speed is set to 110 kmh.

In four wheeled vehicles, the rotation with respect
axis X (angle , also called rolling) is not desired
because this vehicles does not allow a dynamic
camber adjustment. On the contrary, two wheels
vehicles (i.e. bikes and motorcycles) take benefit
of rolling angle to compensate fictitious inertial
force effects when cornering, improving the stability and the performance. The bearing angle  of
the three wheeled vehicle can be dynamically adjusted (controlled) through a tilting mechanism.
The aim of this work is to carry out a controller such that, acting on the wheels steering,
corrects the tilting angle  in such a way that forces to the wheels plane are canceled. Still, there
is a second control objective to track the forward
velocity.

Sliding mode control

In (Moreira et al., 2009) single input controllers
were designed for the tricycle. The selected system input was the front wheels steering angle,
and the selected output was the bodywork tilting
angle. Two controllers were considered, namely
Linear dynamics with a nonlinear gain depending
on the velocity and energy-shaping based nonlinear control. A sliding mode controller based in
the model described in section 2 is presented here.
The input variables are the front wheels steering
angle  and the motor torque Tm . The output
variables are the vehicle tilting angle  and the

1599

vehicle speed u. It is worth to remark that this is
a tracking control problem.
Using the formulation given in (16) and assuming an invertible inertia matrix M , the vehicle
model can be written as

4.2

The system outputs to be regulated to zero are the
errors in the output variables. Given the specifications (zero tilting error and zero speed error in
the X axis) and their relative degree (two and one,
respectively), the following sliding functions

q(t)  M1 Cq(t)  M1 Kq(t) + M1 F(t) (20)

d
(d  ) + (d  )
S1   dt
S2  u d  u

Tacking as state variables x1  q, x2  q, the
system can be modeled by a first order differential
equation,

(21)

In order to reflect the input and the perturbation signals, the term M1 F(t) can also be written as
M1 F(t)  M1 FE (t) + M1 B.ent(t) + M1 P.p(t)
(22)

where

yields (S1 , S2 )  (0, 0), provided that ueq,1  < k1
and ueq,2  < k2 . Hence, the system fulfill u 
d
ud and  dt
(d  )  (d  ) in the subset of
x  S1  0  S2  0 defined by the preceding
inequalities. In order to obtain a sliding domain
large enough1 k1 and k2 are obtained estimating
the extreme values the equivalent controls take.
Both control inputs have been simulated by means
of a relay with hysteresis. Hysteresis width values
are 0.001 for the tilting control and 0.01 for the
speed control. It is known (Moreira et al., 2009)
that the vehicle dynamics is hardly dependent of
the velocity and that all the parameters can be
optimized with respect to this state variable.

(23)

Fbr is the braking force, Fpi is the force due
to road roughness in the ith -wheel and Vvent is the
lateral wind velocity.
Finally, system (21) can be written as
x(t)  f + g.ent(t) + h.pert(t)

Tilting error

First the model is simulated in extreme conditions without perturbations in order to observe
the ideal sliding dynamics. The selected velocities are 4ms, 8.3ms and 30ms to reflect maximum and minimum velocities and an intermediate cruising speed in town. The maximum tilting angles are 0.3rad, 0.07rad and 0.003rad respectively. The simulation consists in turning the
steering wheel to a maximum angle in both directions, and then go back to rest position, for the
three selected velocities.
Figures 5 and 6 show good performance of
both the tilting and the velocity control systems

The tilting error is defined by the force balance
in the direction orthogonal to the wheel plane
(Rajamani, 2006). The fictitious inertial force
mu2
R and the gravity force mg, acting in a orthogonal projection to the plane of the wheel, must be
canceled so that the vehicle is in balance. Hence,

Simulation results show that it is possible to control a vehicle accurately modeled using sliding
modes. The model is a two-input two-output,
eighteen order dynamical system plus actuators
dynamics. In a first and simple design, a set
of parameters that achieve an acceptable system
performance under perturbations can be selected.
An interesting characteristic of this solution is
the input-output decoupling. As it was expected,
the lateral wind perturbation can be compensated
better than road roughness perturbation. The
main conclusion is that it is possible to implement
a really simple (hence cheap) multivariable controller in a nonlinear modeled vehicle using sliding
mode control.
