Abstract This paper presents an alternative approach for improving the stationary fine self-alignment of
strapdown inertial navigation systems (SINS). This approach is based on an expansion on the measurement vector
of the linearised augmented state Kalman filter, which allows us to estimate the observable uncompensated inertial
sensor biases more quickly and more accurately, contributing, thus, to increase the system performance during
the navigation stage.

Introduction

gation system (INS) and its corresponding propagation error dynamic model, linearised around a
nominal operating condition, considered stationary for purposes of the self-alignment, to estimate
and compensate the initial platform misalignment
and the sensor biases. A linearised augmented
state Kalman filter is employed.

In general, the self-alignment procedure of a strapdown inertial navigation system consists of two
steps the coarse self-alignment and the fine selfalignment (Jekeli, 2000). The first is an analytical procedure that consists of measuring the
gravity and the Earth angular velocity vectors
using accelerometers and rate-gyros, respectively
(Britting, 1971). Such a procedure, however, does
not account for the uncompensated inertial sensor
errors, specially the uncompensated biases, resulting in approximate, but incorrect, values for the
estimated platform initial orientation.
The fine self-alignment, however, is a stochastic filtering and optimal estimation based procedure, implemented immediately after the coarse
self-alignment, which intends to improve the estimates of the platform initial orientation, by
also estimating the uncompensated sensor biases
(Rogers, 2007 Grewal et al., 2013).
Among various fine self-alignment methods
proposed in the literature, most of them are based
on the approach originally proposed by (BarItzhack and Berman, 1988). This method, summarized in Section 2, uses the own inertial navi-

As measurement vector, this method uses the
Earth-referenced velocity error vector, which is defined as the difference between the velocities calculated by the INS, and the true velocities, assumed
to be zero. As a result, one obtains a linear system
with degree of observability smaller than the order
of the system, reflecting the consequent inability
of the filter in properly estimating all states (Wu
et al., 2012).
In order to determine which are the unobservable states, different authors have studied this
stationary fine self-alignment approach from the
control theoretic point of view (Bar-Itzhack and
Berman, 1988 Jiang and Lin, 1992), and the conclusions are not in agreement. Here, as in (Fang
and Wang, 1996), it will be assumed that the unobservable states are the uncompensated north
and east accelerometer biases and the east rategyro bias.

The objective of this paper is to propose an
alternative approach for the stationary fine selfalignment of strapdown inertial navigation systems, through an expansion on the measurement
vector of the linearised augmented state Kalman
filter. This approach, introduced in Section 3, includes, in addition to the Earth-referenced velocity errors, the specific force and angular velocity
errors, measured directly by the inertial sensors,
which are directly coupled to the uncompensated
sensor biases.
In Section 4, some results are presented using the traditional and the proposed stationary
fine self-alignment approaches, for the simulated
case of inertial sensor readings only corrupted by
Gaussian white noise and uncompensated biases,
with inertial platform frame perfectly aligned to
the navigation frame. Finally, conclusions are presented in Section 5.

Thus, the computed vales (  ) for the platform position, velocity and attitude become, also,
equally corrupted by a term of error caused by
inertial sensor errors, namely

As mentioned in Section 1, one of the strategies
most widely used in stationary fine self-alignment
of strapdown inertial navigation systems is the one
originally proposed by (Bar-Itzhack and Berman,
1988). In order to better understand this strategy,
let us consider a generic INS. From (Savage, 2007),
it is known that the primary function of a terrestrial inertial navigator consists in integrating,
computationally, the following differential equations

where I is the identity matrix 3  3 and  and
 represent rotation vectors from computed platform attitude and position to true platform attitude and position, respectively.
Substituting (7), (9) and (10) in (1) to (3), the
following set of non-linear differential equations
related to the INS errors are obtained (Rogers,
2007),

the indexes i, e, n and b, represent the inertial
frame (ECI), geographic frame (ECEF), navigation frame (UEN) and platform frame, respectively. In a more specific way,  nen is called transport rate vector, and  bib is the angular velocity
vector measured by the rate-gyros.
By using the linear perturbation technique
(Rogers, 2007), one considers that, in practice, the
specific force vector and the angular velocity vector measured by inertial sensors () are corrupted
by error vectors f and  ib , respectively, that is

In this paper, as in (Bar-Itzhack and Berman,

INS is resting at a location whose geographic coordinates (latitude L) are known almost perfectly.
For this reason, (16) can be eliminated from the
analysis.

where g and  represent the local gravity and
the Earth angular velocity, respectively, and RL
and R are the meridian and transverse radii of
curvature at the platform position (Farrel and
Barth, 1999).
Once obtained the linearised INS error dynamic matrix, one expects to use a Kalman filter
in order to estimate such errors and to provide
corrections to the computed INS attitude.
As explained by (Bar-Itzhack and Berman,
1988) however, (17) is not suitable for use in
Kalman filter since the accelerometer and rategyro errors are not white noise processes as required for proper use in a Kalman filter. Such
an obstacle, however, may be overcome since the
statistical characteristics of realistic accelerometer
and rate-gyro errors data can be represented quite
accurately by the outputs of linear models driven
by white noise process.
Thus, as suggested by (Jekeli, 2000), a suitable inertial sensor error model can be seen as the
sum of an uncompensated bias b, which, in this
paper was assumed to be a random constant, plus
a Gaussian white noise w, that is

The objective of this paper, as mentioned in Section 1, is to propose an alternative approach for
the stationary fine self-alignment of strapdown
inertial navigation systems. Such an approach,
adapted from (Farrel and Barth, 1999), is based
on an expansion on the measurement vector of the
linearised augmented state Kalman filter.

As can be seen, the expansion of the Kalman
filter measurement vector did not improve the system degree of observability. However, as will be
shown in Section 4, the proposed measurement
vector allows the observable states bf x , bx and
bz (up accelerometer bias, and up and north
rate-gyro biases) to be more quickly and more accurately estimated than by using the traditional
measurement vector.

In order to demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed stationary fine self-alignment approach
upon the traditional one, some results are presented for the simulated case of inertial sensor
readings only corrupted by Gaussian white noise
and uncompensated biases, with inertial platform
frame perfectly aligned to the navigation frame.
In the computer simulation one assumed L 
23 120 4600  sampling rate of 100Hz, accelerometer readings corrupted by 0.001g biases and rategyro readings corrupted by 0.3 h biases. Figures
1 to 3 illustrate the observable bias bf x , bx and
bz estimated by using each approach. As can
be seen, although the proposed approach did not
increase the system degree of observability, it improves the estimation convergence rate of the observable biases, which are estimated in few minutes, in contrast to few hours required by the traditional approach.
Despite the effectiveness of the proposed approach, it could not improve the convergence rate
of platform misalignment vector , since this depends directly on the unobservable uncompensated biases bf y , bf z and by , which the Kalman
filter is unable to estimate. Recent works, however, have overcame this deficiency by proposing alternative procedures (Shuanbin et al., 2004),
which may be combined to the approach proposed
in this paper, in order to form a more robust and
accurate stationary fine self-alignment algorithm
for inertial navigation systems.
