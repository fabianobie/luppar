Abstract This paper presents a PID controller design using multiple root locus approach applied to a case of nonminimumphase system a rocket plant with rigid and flexible modes. The plant consists of a simplified dynamic_system of the Brazilian
Satellite Launcher Vehicle (VLS). Initially, the PID parameters are adjusted using multiple root locus to the rigid body of the vehicle. After that, flexible modes, Notch and Butterworth filters are included in the feedback path and the performance is checked.
New root locus are then obtained and a fine adjust to the PID parameters using the multiple root locus is performed and discussed. The time-domain response and requirements are investigated in both cases. The design of PID considers the plant as a
frozen-time system during a finite time interval. In this way the design can be extended along the overall time-varying parameters
of the plant.
Keywords PID controller, multiple root locus, control, flexible modes, Launcher vehicle.
Resumo Este trabalho apresenta o projeto de um controlador PID utilizando a abordagem do lugar_geométrico_das_raízes
(LGR) múltiplo para um sistema de fase_não-mínima planta de um foguete com modos rígidos e flexíveis. A planta consiste de
um sistema dinâmico simplificado do Veículo Lançador de Satélites (VLS). Inicialmente os parâmetros do controlador PID são
ajustados utilizando o LGR múltiplo para o modo de corpo rígido do veículo e em seguida os modos_flexíveis, filtros Butterworth
e Notch são incluídos no sistema_de_controle e o desempenho é então verificado. Novos LGRs são então obtidos e um ajuste fino
dos parâmetros é realizado e discutido. A resposta no domínio_do_tempo e os requisitos são investigados. O projeto do controlador PID considera a planta como um sistema de parâmetros congelados durante um intervalo de tempo finito. Nesse sentido o
projeto pode ser estendido para todos os intervalos onde os parâmetros da planta variam no tempo.

Introduction
2 The Plant and Controller

The design of PID controllers can be performed
according to (Astrm 1988) using Ziegler-Nichols
methods, Cohen-Conn, pole placement and others
approaches. The best choice of values to the parameters is obtained under time-domain specification or
frequency-domain specification, but it is always
subjected to a Hardware-in-the-Loop simulations. So,
in control design, the process of trial and error is
necessary same as using modern techniques. The PID
controller is designed to the feedback control system
of the Brazilian Satellite Launcher Vehicle. This
work presents the multiple root locus approach to the
PID design, because is possible to see the migration and location of all closed loop poles due to rigid,
bending_modes, Notch and Butterworth filters and
mainly the PID zeros and poles. The tendency of
migration of the overall poles is observed using specific programs developed on Matlab. The performance of VLS feedback control using PID is discussed along this work using parameters designed
firstly to only rigid mode and then applied to the
presence of flexible modes and filters.

2.1 The Brazilian VLS Launcher Vehicle
The Brazilian Satellite Launcher Vehicle (VLS) is
shown in Fig. 1. The plant consists of the VLS models (Moreira, 1993 and Oliva, 2000), with rigid body
mode, flexible modes, filters and amplifiers. According to Ramos (Ramos, 2010) the open-loop transfer
function to the VLS considering the reduced set of
coefficients during the maximum dynamic pressure
become,

The parameter   is associated to aerodynamics
effects (dynamic pressure and static margin) and  
to vehicle characteristics (Inertia and Thrust), mentioned in Cornelisse (Cornelisse, 1979) and Greensite
(Greensite, 1970). The worst case to the controller
design occurs during the maximum dynamic pressure, about 39 seconds of flight. In this time the parameters assume   4.35 and    - 7.01.

2.2 The PID Controller
The VLS control system consists of an internal
feedback via angular velocity signal from gyros and
an external feedback via angular displacement signal
from sensor unit. The controller has basically a PID
structure, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3.

Now it is applied the multiple root locus approach. The multiple root locus permits to visualize
the migration of closed-loop poles through the lefthalf plane (LHP) to the left-half plane (RHP), varying the PID parameters from zero to others values.
Thus, the parameters of the PID controller are chosen. It is defined as time-domain specifications, the
overshoot M p  40 and rise time tr  1s , so it
leads on a target region in the s-Laplace plane.

The multiple root locus approach (Franklin,

4 Rigid and Bending Modes and Filters

Initially in Fig. 6 is chosen k d  1, e. g. k d 1.2,
just because the internal loop will present poles near
the imaginary axis. After that, using the root-locus
shown in Fig. 8 it can be choose k i  3.5, e.g. k i 
4. The root locus shown in Fig. 10 presents the root
locus using k i 4 and k d 1.2. These choices can be
done quickly and the simulation results demonstrate
the validity and efficiency of our design.

The main response of the launcher is due to rigid
body and first bending mode. It can be implemented
a Notch filter to the rate gyro output just to minimize
the influence of bending_modes on the controller. On
the other hand, the Notch filter also can minimize the
excitation of the bending_modes by the controller
output. The Butterworth filter is a low-pass filter to
be used in the digital control system for antialiasing.
The Fig. 12 shows the complete block diagram of
VLS control system treated here.
4.1 Bending mode, Notch and Butterworth Filter
transfer functions
The first bending mode is implemented as a second
order dynamic_system, according to Inman (Inman,
1988 and Inman, 1989) and Geradin (Geradin, 1994),
as follows. The first bending mode parameters are
FE 12e5N, k f 1 -2.4e-5,  f 1 0.002 and  f 1 35
rads.

5 Conclusions

The main conclusion of this work is that the
multiple root locus associated to the golden rule can
be applied, with good results, to the PID design controlling a nonminimum-phase system, e.g., the Brazilian VLS Launcher. It can be verified that the
closed loop poles stays at the LHP (s-Laplace domain), in the previous target-region, just collecting
the multiple root locus in an interesting direct and
ordered manner. The multiple root locus permits to
observe the tendency of poles migration through the
root locus and so to choose the limits on the parameters. So the choice of parameters values is clearly
aided by multiple root locus. The spillover effect
(migration of flexible poles from left to right-half
plane) does not happen because de poles are chosen
so far as possible from the imaginary axis. The Notch
and filter is preliminary tuned on the first frequency
of bending mode. It can be observed in Fig 17 that
values to k d parameter upper than 2 tends the closed
