Abstract This paper presents a new Fuzzy tracking control technique for nonlinear SISO plants. The Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy
model-based control technique is integrated with a type-II internal model controller. This type-II controller is designed for tracking step and ramp reference, the rejection of step or ramp perturbations and it has robustness against parameter variations, when
the plant is a linear systems. In this paper, the structure of the type-II internal model controller is used to define the local controllers used in parallel distributed control. Thus, it is possible to design a robust Fuzzy controller for different operation points.
Linear matrix inequalities are used to guarantee closed-loop stability and set the dynamic behaviour of the closed-loop plant.
Experimental results using a DC-DC boost converter demonstrate that the proposed Fuzzy controller is robust and can track step,
ramp and even for sinusoidal references.
Keywords Internal model controller, linear matrix inequalities, nonlinear plants, Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy systems, tracking.
Resumo Este artigo apresenta um novo controlador Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy para sistemas_não_lineares. A técnica de modelagem_e_controle Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy é integrada a um controlador_de_modelagem_interna tipo-II. Este controlador tipo-II é projetado para rastrear referências tipo degrau ou rampa, para rejeitar perturbações tipo degrau e rampa, e também fornece um controle_robusto a variações nos parâmetros da planta, quando a plante é um sistema linear. Neste artigo, a estrutura do controlador de
modelagem interna tipo-II é usado para definir os controladores locais usados no controle paralelo distribuído. Assim, é possível
projetar um controlador Fuzzy robusto para diferentes pontos de operação. Desigualdades lineares matriciais são usadas para garantir a estabilidade em malha_fechada e para definir a dinâmica da planta em malha_fechada. Resultados experimentais usando
um conversor CC-CC boost demonstram que o controlador Fuzzy proposto é robusto e permite o rastreamento quando a referência é um degrau, rampa ou até uma onda senoidal.

Introduction

Many important applications require the tracking
of time-varying references CNC machines, robotics,
nanotechnology, hard disk servo systems, and others.
The system references of these systems include steps
and ramps (Cheng et al., 2007), (Stephens et al.,
2013), (Ratliff and Pagillac, 2006). Furthermore, the
involved plants have nonlinear dynamics, making
more difficult their tracking control.
Nowadays, Takagi-Sugeno (TS) Fuzzy modeling
approach becomes a powerful tool in the analysis and
control of nonlinear_systems (Zhang et al., 2012),
(Fadali and Jafarzadeh, 2014) since we can use it to
model a nonlinear system as a Fuzzy average of linear local subsystems. In many applications, parallel
distributed compensation (PDC) and linear matrix
inequalities (LMI) are used to design Fuzzy controllers based on TS models, in order to guarantee asymptotic stability, robustness against perturbations
and parameter variations. Furthermore, other control
strategies such as model predictive control (MPC)
(Zhang et al., 2007) and internal model controller
(IMC) (Xie and Rad, 2000), (Boukezzoula et al.,
2003) can be used together with the TS Fuzzy modelISSN 2525-8311

ing approach. IMCs have good performance for
tracking tasks and are robust against perturbations.
For that reason, we focus on the use of IMCs in the
development of Fuzzy controllers.
Most Fuzzy controllers based on IMC require the
determination of the inverse of the model plant (Xie
and Rad, 2000). Analytical and iterative algorithms
were proposed to estimate the model (Boukezzoula et
al., 2003). However, the convergence conditions of
these techniques cannot be ensured.
A different approach consists in the addition of an
integrator to the controller. In (El Beid and Doubabi,
2014), triangular membership functions are used. On
the other hand, the Fuzzy controller in (Cordero et
al., 2013) makes use of the exact modeling technique
in (Taniguchi et al., 2001) to get the membership
functions. This approach integrates a type-I internal
model controller (IMC) with the Takagi-Sugeno
Fuzzy model based controller, in order to guarantee a
robust tracking of step references. However, these
techniques were not designed for tracking ramps or
other time-varying references.
In order to create a simple and robust tracking controller for non-linear systems, this paper presents the
integration of a type-II IMC (IMC-II) described in
(Dorf and Bishop, 1998) with a TS Fuzzy model-

based technique in order for a nonlinear SISO plant
to track step, ramp and even sinusoidal references.
The IMC-II is composed by two integrators and a
state feedback, allowing the tracking of step and
ramp references and the rejection of disturbances.
The Fuzzy controller is defined through PDC, where
the local controllers are composed by local IMC-II
controllers. The stability and dynamics of the closedloop plant are set through linear matrix inequalities
(LMIs). In this paper, this new Fuzzy strategy is
called as IMC-II-TS Fuzzy controller.
The main contribution of this paper is the integration
of a type-II tracking IMC with a Takagi-Sugeno
Fuzzy system. Besides, this research opens the possibility of using other IMCs in Fuzzy systems.
This paper is organized as follows Section II describes the characteristics of a type-II IMC and the
Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy modeling-based technique.
Section III defines the IMC-II-TS Fuzzy controller
and the setting of its parameters through LMIs. Section IV shows experimental results from a boost converter that validates the accuracy and robustness of
the proposed IMC-II-TS Fuzzy controller. Finally,
conclusions are presented.

2.2 Type-II Internal Model Controller
Lemma 1 (Internal model principle, Dorf and Bishop, 1998) Let R(s), G(s), GC(s) represent the reference, plant and the controller, respectively. If
G(s)GC(s) contains R(s), then the output of the plant
will track the reference asymptotically, i.e. the
steady-state tracking error (et) will be zero.

2.1 Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Model-Based Controller
Consider the following nonlinear SISO model of
a plant

x  f (x)  g(u )
y  q ( x)

(1)

where x is the state vector, y is the system output, w
is a disturbance, while f(.), g(.) and q(.) are nonlinear
functions. This plant can be expressed through the
following Fuzzy system (Teixeira et al., 2003)

where M(s) is a transfer function that cancel neither
the poles nor the zeros of R(s).
Fig. 1 shows an IMC designed for the output y to
track the ramp reference r, as described in (Dorf and
Bishop, 1998). This controller can also reject step
perturbations. Observe that the controller has two
integrators, i.e. it is a type II system. Hence, this controller is called type-II IMC (IMC-II). The integrators
define two new state variables, z1 and z2

According to (8), if the system in (10) becomes asymptotically stable, then e, z1 and e tend to zero.
Hence, the closed loop system will track the reference. It is possible to use different linear control
techniques in order to get Ke.

Note the similarity between (10) and (18). Hence, if
the local gains Kej guarantee the asymptotic stability
of (17), then the tracking error tends to zero when the
reference is a step or ramp functions. This approach
is based on the fact that if the tracking error in each
local model tends to zero (according to Lemma 1),
then the tracking error of the whole system will also
tend to zero. The controller defined in (14) is called
as IMC-II-TS Fuzzy controller.

Applying the properties in (4), and considering
C  Ci (i  1, , n), then (8) and (9) can be expressed as in (12) and (13), respectively

The design of the local feedback matrices Kej, in
order to guarantee the stability of (18) and the location of the closed-loop poles in the area indicated in
Fig. 2, can be achieved through the following linear
matrix inequalities (LMI) (Olalla et al., 2010),

Numerical softwares such as MATLAB can be used
to solve the LMIs in (19), (20), (21) and (22). Others
LMIs used to define other regions where the closedloop poles are located can be found in (Olalla et al.,

The Fuzzy controller was implemented in the DSP
DS1104. The switching frequency was set in 50 kHz.
Figs. 4 and 5 show the results for the tests 1 and 2.
The settling time is less than 0.09s. The average
steady-state tracking error is zero, even for ramp references.
Figs. 6 and 7 indicate that the tracking error for sinusoidal references is also very small. This result is
expected due to sinusoidal waveforms can be approximated as linear functions in some operations point,
according to Taylor series, especially when the signal
is near to zero.

In the model described in (24), the input voltage vdc is
considered as a perturbation, while P is the perturbation matrix. It is considered that the perturbation will
be rejected by the controller (assumption based on
Lemma 1). Thus, the effect of P is not considered in
the design of the IMC-II-TS Fuzzy controller.
The boost converter has the following parameters vdc
 9V, L  680H, C  150F and R  270 (nominal). However, it also allows the use of a load of 220
 in order to test the robustness of the Fuzzy controller against parameter variations. As a result, four tests
were done to test the accuracy and robustness of the
controller

This paper presented a new tracking Fuzzy controller
based on the integration of TS Fuzzy model-based
technique and type-II internal model controller (IMCII). Experimental tests show that the tracking error is
small, even for sinusoidal references and considering
parameter variations. Furthermore, the Fuzzy controller rejects the disturbance in the plant (in the experimental test, the input voltage was considered as a
disturbance in the plant model). In general, any reference can be approximated by a linear function in a
specific operation point. The dynamics of the closedloop plant can be adjusted by modifying the parameters of the area in Fig. 2, or setting other conditions
through other LMI statements, e.g. an area delimited
by a circumference or a maximum angle of the poles.
Other techniques as H2 or Hinf norm can be used to
improve the performance of the proposed IMC-II-TS
Fuzzy controller. As future work, other nonlinear
plants and LMIs will be used in order to test the robustness and accuracy of the proposed IMC-II-TS
Fuzzy controller.
