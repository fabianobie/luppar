Abstract In this paper, two different synchronization schemes for a new modified Chua oscillator are presented. The synchronization schemes are designed by using active control and Lyapunov stability theories. In
the first scheme, the slave requires three signals from the master for synchronization. In the second scheme, only
one signal from the master is required for synchronization. The difference between both schemes is, besides the
number of required signals, the synchronization time. A Poincare map is provided as a proof of chaoticity of the
modified oscillator. Numerical simulations are performed in order to verify the results.

In this paper, we present two synchronization
schemes for a modified Chua oscillator. This oscillator is the physical realization of a circuit developed by Leon Chua (Chua et al., 1986) and
it is well known for its simplicity and because it
shows chaotic dynamics when the appropriate devices are selected. There are several works on the
Chua oscillator and different modifications have
been proposed. For instance, Hartley (1989) proposed a modification of the characteristic function
f (x1 ) of the oscillator. The piecewise nonlinearity of the system was replaced by a cubic nonlinearity. This nonlinearity has a shape similar
to that of the original function while remaining
smooth. This modification was done in order to
avoid the analysis difficulties due to the discontinuities of the original function. Some works in
which this variation of the Chua circuit is considered are (Salarieh and Alasty, 2008), (Wu and
Chen, 2002) and (Yassen, 2003). Wu and Chen
(2002) designed a backstepping controller for suppressing the chaotic motion of the modified Chua
circuit. Yassen (2003) addressed the adaptive_control and synchronization of the modified Chua
circuit with unknown parameters. Salarieh and
Alasty (2008) investigated the drive-response synchronization problem between two Chua oscillators with stochastically time varying different parameters. On the other hand, a new version of
the Chua circuit was investigated by (Kilic, 2006).
The objective of the work was to perform an experimental study about the impulsive synchronization of the the modified Chua circuits. The
author modified the circuit connections and in-

Introduction

The synchronization of chaotic systems is a topic
that has raised the interest of scents in the last 30
years approximately. Pecora and Carroll (1990)
were among the first to work on this idea. The
objective is to use the output of the driving (or
master) system to control the response (or slave)
system in such a way that they both oscillate in
a synchronized manner. It is possible to find in
the literature a wide variety of synchronization
schemes. For instance, Agiza and Yassen (2001)
demonstrated that two chaotic systems can be
synchronized by means of active control. The authors worked with two systems one of them composed of two identical Rossler oscillators and the
other one composed of two identical Chen oscillators. Huang (2008), investigates the chaos synchronization of two different hyperchaotic oscillators with fully unknown parameters. In this work,
he explores synchronization of the Lorenz-Stenflo
(LS) system with a novel dynamical system called
CYQY, as well as the synchronization between an
LS system and a hyper chaotic system. In order
to achieve this goal, adaptive_control techniques
are employed. Park (2006) investigates the chaos
synchronization between two different chaotic systems by means of nonlinear control laws. The
author demonstrates that the two different systems could be controlled using nonlinear control
techniques and proved the closed-loop stability by
means of linear control theory. Other examples
can be found in the works by Benitez and Acho
(2007), Chua et al. (1993), Chuang et al. (2012),
Feki (2003), Koofigar et al. (2011) and Zhang et al.

serted passive elements. The resulting circuit was
a higher dimensional system that exhibits the original dynamics of the Chua circuit.
The proposed modification in this paper is a
new characteristic function f (x) that is bounded.
This can facilitate the analysis and synchronization and could be useful in applications such as secure communications. The objective of this work
is the synchronization of two modified Chua oscillators using active control and Lyapunov stability
theories. The paper is organized as follows. In
Section 2, we explain the new modification of the
Chua oscillator and demonstrate that it is indeed
chaotic. In Section 3, a three-signal synchronization scheme is develop. In Section 4, a one-signal
synchronization scheme is presented. The performance of both synchronization schemes are presented in Section 5 and the conclusions are outlined in Section 6.

A proof of chaoticity of the new system is provided by means of a Poincare map. This is a useful graphical tool that helps determining if a system is periodic, non-periodic, chaotic or random
(Thomsen, 2003). It can be created by observing
where the trajectories of the system intersect a
particular plane at discrete time tk , k  0, 1, 2....
If the Poincare map consists neither of a finite
number of points nor of points filling up a closed
curve but nevertheless appear ordered, then it is
a strong indicator of chaos (Thomsen, 2003).

where the overdot denotes differentiation with respect to time t  > 0,  > 0, m0 and m1 are
parameters that must be chosen appropriately for
obtaining chaotic behavior. The function f (x1 ) is
the canonical piecewise-linear function describing
an odd-symmeric three-segment piecewise-linear
curve having a breakpoint at x  1 and x  1,
a slope equal to m0  a + 1 < 0 at the inner segment and m1  b + 1 > 0 at the outer segments,
respectively.
The chaotic oscillator that we are using in this
work is a modified Chua oscillator. In this work,
we modified the original system by choosing the
following characteristic function f (x1 )
f (x1 )   sin x1  e0.1x1  .

The Chua oscillator is the physical realization of
an oscillator developed by Leon Chua during his
visit to Waseda University (Tokyo, Japan) in 1983
- 1984. The circuit is well known for its simplicity
but most importantly for its chaoticity when the
appropriate devices are selected. Hence the interest it has raised since it was published and that is
patent in several works found in literature. The
equations of the dimensionless system are (Chua
et al., 1986)

Figure 3 is the Poincare map of our modified Chua oscillator generated when the trajectories intersect the plane x + y + z + 1  0 as
it is depicted in Figure 2. The map of Figure 3
shows the points where the trajectories intersect
the plane. The two different markers show if the
trajectory goes in one direction or another as it
intersects the plane. The map is seen in the XY
plane perspective.

The system of Equations 1-3 and 5 shows a chaotic

Theorem 1 Consider the modified Chua oscillator given by Equations 1 - 3 and 5 with  and
 having appropriate positive values that guarantee the chaoticity of the system. Then the slave

Now consider the following Lyapunov function
candidate and its derivative

In this section we develop a synchronization
scheme for the modified Chua oscillator. The design is done using active control and Lypaunov
stability theories. The resulting slave requires
three signals from the master for synchronization.
The following theorem is the base of the synchronization scheme that uses three signals for synchronization.

Recall that the functions f (x1 ) and f (x2 ) are

Proof Consider the system of Equations 1 - 3 and
5 as the master system. The objective is to find a
new system, the slave, that synchronizes with the
master. Hence, let the slave be
x2  (y2  f (x2 )) + u1 ,

z2  y2 + u3 ,

(25)

with k1 > 0, k2 > 0 and k3 > 0. Substitution of
Equations 23 - 25 into 22 yields
V  k1 e21  k2 e22  k3 e23  0.

(26)

Since V > 0 and V  0, and according to Lyapunovs stability theory, the error variables will
converge to zero and thus

1160

Proof Let the system of Equations 1 - 3 be the
master and the system of Equations 27 - 29 be
the slave. The function f (x1 ) in 5 is such that
f (x1 )  1, t  0. Since the system 1 - 3 is
chaotic, the signal y1 (t) is bounded and thus, there
exists a constant  > 0 such that y1 (t)   t 
0. In fact,  depends on the initial conditions.
However, assuming that y1 (0) lays inside the attractor then  can be obtained independently of
the initial conditions. The proof begins by defining the following error variable and its derivative

i) lim e1  lim x2 (t)  x1 (t)  0  x2

ii) lim e2  lim y2 (t)  y1 (t)  0  y2

iii) lim e3  lim z2 (t)  z1 (t)  0  z2 
t

z1 .
Thus, the master and slave systems synchronize globally and asymptotically. Finally, substitute Equations 23 - 25 into Equations 10 - 12. This
yields

e1  x1  x2 , e1  x1  x2 .

x2   f (x2 )  2sgn(x2  x1 )

Consider the terms x1 and x2 from Equations
1 and 27, respectively. Substitution of these terms
into Equation 30 yields

 k1 (x2  x1 ) + y1 ,
y2 x1  y1  k2 (y2  y1 ) + z1 ,
z2   y1  k3 (z2  z1 ),

e1  (y1  f (x1 ))k  sgn(x1  x2 ).

f (x2 )   0.1 sin x2 e0.1x2  ,
and the proof is complete.

One-signal synchronization

The synchronization scheme developed in Section
3 requires three signals x1 , y1 z1 for synchronizing
the master and the slave. This may not be appropriate in some applications like communications
where the transmission channels are limited and
thus, the least amount of signals for transmission
is required. In this section we present a different
synchronization scheme that requires only one signal for synchronizing the master and the slave. It
consists of a dynamic_system that takes the signal x1 generates the signals x2 , y2 and z2 that are
estimations of the oscillator signals x1 , y1 and z1 ,
respectively. The following theorem is the base of
the synchronization system.

 ke1  + y1 e1 + f (x1 )e1 
 ke1  + y1 e1 +   1  e1 
 ke1  + y1 e1 + e1 .

Recall that  > 0 and y1 (t) < . Thus we
can write
V 1  ke1  + e1  + e1 
 e1  (k  ( + 1)) .
V 1 will decrease and converge in finite time if
and only if k > ( + 1). Under this condition,
there exists a settling time t  Ts such that

Theorem 2 Consider the modified Chua oscillator given by Equations 1 - 3 and 5 with  and

the chaoticity of the system. Consider also a constant  > 0 such that x2 (t) < . Then the system

and thus x1 (t)  x2 (t), t  Ts . After t  Ts ,
the synchronization system is completed with the
subsystem of Equations 28 and 29. Define two new
error variables e2 and e3 and their derivatives, as

e3  z1  z2 , e3  z1  z2 .

from the slaves. In this case there is notorious difference in the time the slave takes to synchronize
the signals. In the case of the three-signal slave, it
synchronizes both signals in less than 0.5 seconds
while the one-signal slave takes approximately 5.5
seconds to synchronize. Recall from Section 4 that
the convergence of all the signals area achieved in
two steps first, the signal x1 converges and after
that, the system is completed and the remaining
signals converge.

Numerical results

The synchronizations schemes developed in Sections 3 and 4 were implemented in MatlabSimulink in order to study its performance.
The modified Chua system is that of Equations
1 - 3 and 5 with   9.35 and   14.35. The
three-signal slave is that of Equations 6 - 8 with
k1  k2  k3  5. The one-signal slave of Equations 27 - 29 with k  1000. The initial conditions
of the master oscillator are x1 (0)  15, x2 (0)  0
and x3 (0)  15. The initial conditions of the
slave oscillators are, in both cases, y1 (0)  10,
y2 (0)  1 and y3 (0)  15.
Figure 4 compares the signals x1 from the
master and the y1 from both slaves. The legend 1s refers to the one-signal slave synchronizer
while 3s refers to the three-signal slave synchronizer. In both cases, the signals synchronize in
less than 0.2 seconds. The one-signal slave synchronizes the signal x1 faster than the other. This
can be better seen in Figure 5.
Figures 6 and 7 compare the signals x2 and
x3 from the master with the signals y2 and y3

Conclusion

In this paper presented two synchronization
schemes for a new modified Chua oscillator. The
modified Chua chaotic oscillator proposed here
has a different characteristic function f (x). The
new characteristic function has the property that
it is bounded. The oscillator was proven to be
chaotic by means of a Poincare Map. The synchronization schemes differ in the number of signals required to synchronize. In the first one, three
signals are required while in the second one only
one signal does the job. The synchronization time
of the first scheme is much faster than the sec-
