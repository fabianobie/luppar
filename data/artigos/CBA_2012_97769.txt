Abstract This paper aims to present an approach for design of dynamic output feedback compensators for
linear discrete-time descriptor systems subject to state and control constraints. To this end, output feedback
controlled invariant polyhedra are constructed by taking a pair of polyhedral sets a controlled invariant set
and a conditioned invariant set. By defining an augmented system composed by the original system plus the
dynamic compensator, a control action can be computed online, which optimizes the contraction rate of the
augmented state trajectory and enforces the constraints. The results are illustrated through a numerical example
which shows that the proposed dynamic compensators outperform static feedback controllers under the same
conditions.

Resumo O presente trabalho apresenta uma metodologia de projeto de compensadores dinamicos por
realimentacao_de_sada, em sistemas_descritores lineares sujeitos a restricoes no estado e no controle. Para isto,
poliedros invariantes controlados por realimentacao_de_sada sao construdos a partir de um par de conjuntos
poliedricos um invariante controlado e o outro invariante condicionado. A partir da definicao de um sistema
aumentado, composto pelo sistema original e pelo compensador dinamico, uma acao de controle pode ser calculada
online, que otimiza a taxa de contracao do trajetoria do estado deste sistema aumentado e assegura o respeito as
restricoes. Os resultados sao ilustrados atraves de um exemplo numerico, que demonstram que o compensador
dinamico proposto supera o desempenho_de_controladores estaticos sob as mesmas condicoes.

Introduction

The development of control techniques that take
into account constraints on system variables had
outstanding contributions in the last decades.
In particular, the approaches based on positive
invariance (Vassilaki et al., 1988 Vassilaki and
Bitsoris, 1989 Mesquine et al., 2006 Baddou
et al., 2006), and controlled invariance of sets
(Blanchini, 1994 Dorea and Hennet, 1999b Dorea
and Hennet, 1999a), have shown a great potential
for control applications. On the other hand,
only few works dealt with constrained control of
descriptor systems (Georgiou and Krikelis, 1991
Tarbouriech and Castelan, 1993 Tarbouriech
and Castelan, 1995 Castelan and Tarbouriech,
2003). Descriptor systems have great relevance in
theoretical and practical aspects of control field,
for descriptor models give a richer representation
of robotic systems, electrical circuits, chemical
processes, among other examples (Luenberger and
Arbel, 1977 Luenberger, 1978 Verghese et al.,
1981 Lewis, 1986 Dai, 1989 Rehm, 2004 Duan,
2010). Recently, the set invariance approach has
been successfully extended to descriptor systems

in the context of both constrained control by
means of controlled invariant polyhedra (Araujo
and Dorea, 2010 Araujo, Barroso, Barros and
Dorea, 2012), and state estimation with error
limitation by means of conditioned invariant
polyhedra (Araujo et al., 2010 Araujo, Barros
and Dorea, 2012). In (Araujo, Barroso, Barros
and Dorea, 2012), the concept of output feedback
controlled invariant polyhedra (Dorea, 2009) was
extended to descriptor models, and static output
feedback controllers that guarantee constraints
satisfaction were computed in an online scheme
for liquid level control. However, conditions for
existence of static output feedback controllers
are very hard to be met in the general case.
In this paper we show that a pair formed
by a controlled invariant and a conditioned
invariant polyhedron can be used to construct
another polyhedron which is controlled-invariant
under dynamic output feedback compensation.
A numerical example show the merit of the
methodology and its potential use in real world
problems.

Preliminaries

Descriptor Models

Consider the following discrete-time descriptor
model
Ex(k + 1)  Ax(k) + B2 u(k) + B1 d(k), (1)
y(k)  Cx(k) + (k),

(2)

where x  Rn is the state vector, u  Rm is
the control input, d(k)  Rp is an exogenous,
disturbance channel, y  Rl is a measurement
output and (k)  Rl is a measurement noise.
Without loss of generality, the state vector and
the matrices in the descriptor equation have the
following standard form


x1 (k + 1)
x(k + 1)

x2 (k + 1)

The system is assumed to be causal, i.e.,
det(A22 ) 6 0. Under this assumption, the
following augmented, equivalent standard state
space model was derived in (Araujo and Dorea,
2010). By taking the static substate equation of
the systems, x2 (k + 1) can be written as
x2 (k + 1)  A1

By replacing x1 (k + 1) in (3) , and aggregating
x1 (k + 1) back plus u(k + 1)  u(k) + u(k + 1),
the following equation comes

Invariant Polyhedra

A polyhedral set is a natural way of describing
constraints on the variables of a system, since
such constraints can be naturally written as
linear inequalities. Hence,

 a polyhedron on the
x
augmented state  
is given by
u
    G  

(5)

where G  Rg(n+m) and   Rg .
The unknown disturbance acting in the system
(4) is assumed to be bounded in a compact
polyhedron as
d(k)  D  d  V d  
sp

(6)

s

with V  R
and   R .
In a natural manner, one can incorporate in the
design of constrained regulators a rate constraint
in the form
u(k)  V  u Lu  

(7)

in which L  Rqm and   Rq .
The definition of controlled invariance for
such polyhedron is now given.

In this standard, augmented form, the one step
ahead increment of the control input is taken as
the new control action, while the control input
is treated as a state variable. By using this

If full state information is available, the
control action u(k + 1) can be computed as
a function of the state. But, this information
frequently is not accessible, and only a partial
information given by a measurement, sometimes
noisy output given by (2), is available. Then,
consider the augmented output for the system (4)

of controlled and conditioned invariant polyhedra
for standard linear state-space systems, can

Main Result

As pointed out in the previous section, a simultaneously controlled and conditioned invariant
polyhedron is a candidate to be o.f.c.i., and if
one can constructs such a polyhedron, o.f.c.i.
can be checked using the necessary and sufficient
condition seen in (Dorea, 2009) and (Araujo,
Barroso, Barros and Dorea, 2012). This approach
can be justified by the absence, to the date,
of a method for the computation of an o.f.c.i.
polyhedron starting from the polyhedron of the
constraints. Henceforth, the main result for this
paper is described.
Consider then the augmented system (4) and
the output equation (8), and also a n-th order
dynamic compensator in the form

  .
Now, the definition of conditioned invariant
polyhedra is given.
Definition 2.2 The polyhedron  
  G   is conditioned invariant contractive with respect to the system (4) if,
y(k)  Y(), v(y, k) such that

Let now the only information available for
feedback be the output y(k). One can define a
polyhedron as o.f.c.i. (Dorea, 2009) according to
Definition 2.3 The polyhedron  
  G   is output-feedback controlled
invariant (o.f.c.i.) -contractive with respect to
the system (4) if, y(k)  Y(), u(y(k), k +

It is easy to check that for a given polyhedron
to be o.f.c.i., a necessary condition is that
it is simultaneously controlled and conditioned
invariant. These preliminary concepts will be
explored in the next section, where the main result
of this paper is presented.

Consider now the partition of the controlled

one has the relation at the top of the next page.
It shows that  is controlled invariant. Now, the

Remark 3.1 For the computation of controlled invariant polyhedron, the chosen approach
is that seen in (Dorea and Hennet, 1999a), and
for the construction of the conditioned invariant
polyhedron, the algorithms in (Araujo, Barros and
Dorea, 2012) were used here. As a consequence for
the later, the dynamic compensator state zx is an
estimative of the system state, as will be seen in
the next sections.

contraction rate c  0.98 was computed using
the approach of (Dorea and Hennet, 1999b). The
o.f.c.i. condition presented in (Dorea, 2009) was
checked, and the polyhedron fails to satisfy it
then, the computed polyhedron is not o.f.c.i. by
static output feedback.
Taking a dynamic compensator, a polyhedron, candidate to be o.f.c.i. with respect to
the augmented system plus compensator was
constructed. To this end, a conditioned invariant
polyhedron with contraction rate o  0.8 was
computed by the techniques of (Araujo, Barros

from a confidence polyhedron

the polyhedron was checked to be o.f.c.i. with
contraction rate of 0.98, confirming the efficacy
for the approach. Figure 1 shows the controlled
invariant polyhedron and a state trajectory for the
augmented system.
The control action u(k + 1) was computed
online as in (Araujo, Barroso, Barros and Dorea,
2012). One can verify that the open loop system
is unstable thus, the computed control action
stabilizes the system and enforce the constraints.
As an important consequence, the Figure 2 brings
the conditioned invariant polyhedron used in the
construction of the o.f.c.i. polyhedron, together
with the initial confidence polyhedron and the
error trajectory x(k)  zx (k). It confirms that
the dynamic compensator is also an observer for
the system state.

Concluding Remarks

An approach for constrained control of descriptor
systems by means of dynamic output feedback
compensator design was presented. The approach
is based on the concept of o.f.c.i. polyhedral
sets and unifies the concepts of controlled and
conditioned invariant polyhedra in the same
design. The polyhedra obtained in this manner
result in better control performance than static
output feedback in the presented example. Both
the methodology employed, and the application
can be considered novel contributions for the field
