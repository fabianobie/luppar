Abstract This paper considers the trajectory tracking control of a wheeled mobile robot (WMR) with
slipping in the wheels, i.e., when the kinematic constraints are not satisfied. The proposed controller guarantees
that the tracking error converges to small ball of the origin such that the radius of this ball can be adjusted by
selecting appropriate parameters. To this end, the controller is designed in two parts the kinematic controller
based in curvilinear coordinates and the dynamic controller based in a nonlinear state feedback. The dynamic
model of the WMR considered in this paper is the given in formalism with the aid of the singular perturbations
theory. The singular perturbations theory allows to manipulate the flexibility through of a small factor in
the dynamic model (normally, known as ) at the same time that scales the dissatisfaction of the kinematics
constraints. Thus, we will observe the behavior of the tracking resultant when the controller is applied to such
model.
Keywords Nonholonomic wheeled mobile robot, slipping, curvilinear coordinates, trajectory tracking control, singular perturbations.
Resumo Este artigo aborda o problema de controle_de_seguimento_de_trajetoria de um robo_movel (RMR)
com deslizamento nas rodas, ou seja, com insatisfacao das restricoes cinematicas. O controlador proposto garante
com que o erro de seguimento convirja a uma vizinhanca da origem representada por uma bola cujo raio pode
ser ajustado pela escolha de parametros apropriados. Para tal fim, o controlador e projetado em duas partes
o controlador cinematico baseado em coordenadas_curvilneas e o controlador dinamico baseado em uma realimentacao nao-linear de estados. O modelo_dinamico do RMR considerado neste artigo e formalizado pelo uso da
teoria de perturbacoes_singulares. A teoria de perturbacoes_singulares nao so permite manipular a flexibilidade
dentro do modelo_dinamico atraves de um pequeno fator (usualmente conhecido como ), mas tambem pondera a
insatisfacao das restricoes cinematicas. Dessa forma, neste artigo sera observado o comportamento do controlador
de seguimento_de_trajetoria proposto quando este seja aplicado no modelo_dinamico.

control laws, and hybrid control laws (For more
details, see (Bloch et al., 2000 Kolmanovsky and
McClamroch, 1995)).
The tracking problem of WMRs has also been
studied. The techniques for trajectory control
has been based in linearization techniques for local controlling (Walsh et al., 1994) in techniques of nonlinear state feedback with singular
parameters (DAndrea-Novel et al., 1995 Leroquais and DAndrea-Novel, 1996 Motte and Campion, 2000) or also in techniques based in backstepping (Jiang, 2000 Jiang and Nijmeijer, 1999).
In this paper, we consider the tracking control problem of WMRs which are subjected to
slipping effects, i.e., when the nonholonomic kinematic constraint of pure rolling is transgressed during the motion. In principle, this is due
to various effects such as deformability or flexibility of the wheels (Leroquais and DAndrea-Novel,
1996 Fernandez et al., 2012 Fernandez and Cer-

Introduction

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the design of feedback-control laws for
mechanical systems subjected to nonholonomic
constraints. This is the case of the stabilization
and tracking problems of wheeled mobile robots
(WMRs). The stabilization has been an extensive
research area in past decades due to its challenging theoretical nature, i.e., an intrinsic nonlinear
control problem, and its practical importance . It
is well-known that there does not exist a smooth pure state feedback control law1 such that
the state of a wheeled mobile robot converges to
the origin (Dong and Kuhnert, 2005 Fernandez
et al., 2013). In order to mitigate this difficulty,
several types of controllers have been proposed,
such as time-varying control laws, discontinuous

By considering these effects, we will study the trajectory tracking control of the WMRs with slipping in the dynamic and aim at designing a robust
controller based in a nonlinear state feedback. To
this end, the kinematics of the WMR is derived by
considering the slipping and small deformations of
the wheels. Such consideration allows to use the
singular perturbations theory due to its powerful
utility to insert small parameters which can be
used to represent the flexibility (or wheels deformation) (DAndrea-Novel et al., 1995). Thus, the
dynamic of the WMR is given in formalism with
the aid of Lagrange approach, like in (Fernandez
et al., 2013). Complementary, the singular perturbations theory is used to add a small scale factor that represents the flexibility (or deformation).
However, some assumptions are made about the
kinematic constraints and the scale factor so that
the kinematic controller and the dynamic controller can be designed.
This paper is organized as follow In Section
2 is showed the mathematical model and the preliminaries foundations associated with the singular perturbation theory. In Section 3 is presented
the project of the controller divided in two parts,
the kinematic controller based in curvilinear coordinates and the dynamic controller based in a
nonlinear state feedback. In order to verify effectiveness of the proposed controller, in Section 4 a
simulation is done. Finally, conclusions and final
remarks are made in Section 5.

Given a differentiable simple curve C defined by
one of its point, the unitary tangent vector at the
point, and its curvature curv(s) where s is the
curvilinear coordinate along the curve, the following assumptions will be considered in order to
make the controller design easy (Dong and Kuhnert, 2005).

The Tikhonovs theorem states the relation

Like in (DAndrea-Novel et al., 1995), assuming
that the control input u is a smooth function of

a combination of the existing results in singular
techniques when the slipping is included into the
dynamic model (DAndrea-Novel et al., 1995 Leroquais and DAndrea-Novel, 1996). Unlike contributions using manifolds of  in order to linearize

Evaluating the controller
Let considered the following transformation on 
for a better numerical manipulation

In the kinematic controller, the transformation
q2
e2  2R
 tan 2R guarantees that q2  < R if e2
is bounded. In other hand, if the one wants to
make q2  < d0 < R (where d0 is a positive
constant that represents the initial displacement
of the point p) during the control, then one can
2
set e2  2d0 tan q
2d0 . It should be noted that
the initial value of q2 should be less than d0 too.
Otherwise, an open-loop control can be first applied to the system such that q2 < d0 .
In order to verify effectiveness of the proposed controller, simulations were done by using the
kinematic control defined by (32) and the robust
nonlinear state feedback based controller defined
by (30). However, we must first know the appropriate value for  due that Theorem 1 imposes the
limit  .

being n  Z+ and N  0, 1  IR+ . Assuming
that the coefficients D and G are the same for all
wheels and by using of (9) and the Assumption 2,
we chosen D0  G0  1 N.
We assume that the desired trajectory is a
rhombus with the diagonals equal to 6.28 m. Each
simulation represent a duration of 4.5 s. The numerical values used in the simulations are are the
same so (Leroquais and DAndrea-Novel, 1996)

L  1 m, b  1 m and r  0.35 m. In the kinematic controller we choose k1  k2  1, 1  0.01
and R  105 m due that the rhombus has four
corners (i.e., curv(s)  ), thus R  105 m simulates a quasi-infinite curvature.

Remark 3 Phenomenologically, the value of  is
associated with the flexibility and deformation of
the wheels, we can say that when the value of  increases then the computational cost of the control
law (30) also increases. This is a direct consequence of the friction coefficient, which also increases when the deformation of the wheels increases
and it is a significant cause of the dead zone in
the actuator. So, the computational effort is associated with an attempt of the control law (30)
to overcome the dead zone (Fernandez and Cerqueira, 2009b).

In Fig. 3(b) is shown the computational cost
(measured in seconds) for the interval 1016 , 9 
1011  in the domain of . It can be seen that
the evolution of the computational cost increases
when  increases. Particularly, when   91011
(N  0.8 and n  11) the system is unstable for
the tracking, as shown in Fig. 3(a). Thus, it is
defined   9  1011 in the Theorem 1. Values
greater than  unstabilize the system.

Trajectory tracking

deviations associated with both cases (  0 and
 6 0) is presented in Table 1. All these deviations
were measured by taking the maximum distance
with respect to the first corner of the rhombus.
It can be noted that when the speed vn increases the deviations are also larger (see the second
column in the Table 1). This is because the increased curvature at corners of the rhombus, i.e.,
when R is sufficiently larger the contribution of
slipping is greater. Then, a higher speed incurs a
greater slipping. Theoretically, a model that argues such rate of increase is the model of pseudoslipping. For more details see (DAndrea-Novel
et al., 1995).

To observe the behavior of the control law (30)
when it is applied in the model defined by (5)(7), we can study the cases in which the model is
totally rigid (  0) and flexible ( 6 0), according
to the Remark 1.
In Fig. 4(a) is shown the tracking made by
the control law (30) when   4  1011 such that
the condition  <  (9  1011 ) in the Theorem
1 is satisfied. In Fig. 5 is shown the evolution of
the vector  and demonstrated that   0 guarantee the Condition 2. Thus, it is possible to
assert that the dynamic model defined by (5)-(7)
satisfies the approximations (26) and (27). The
Fig. 4(a) presents the tracking of the trajectory
for four different velocities 2.34 cms, 4.68 cms,
7.02 cms and 9.36 cms. For each speed were measured deviations d. A better detailing about the

By setting   0 the dynamic model becomes
rigid. In Fig. 4(b) is shown the behavior of the
tracking. However, this behavior presents a greater deviation than the case  6 0 (compare the
deviations in Table 1).

Final remarks

In this paper, the path tracking control problem of
a WMR with slipping has been considered. A robust controller based in a nonlinear state feedback
for the dynamic model of the WMR also has been
proposed. The dynamic model was considered by
using the singular perturbations theory (see equations (5)-(7)). The controller was designed in two
parts on the one hand, the kinematic controller
was projected by using the curvilinear coordinates
and the other hand the dynamic controller essentially based in inverse dynamic (compare (29) and
(30)). The control law (30) was used in the dynamic model for the cases when   0 (totally rigid)
and when  6 0 (flexible). The results observed
in the Subsection 4.2 indicates that the consideration of the flexible system is better than the rigid
system. However, the deviations observed in the
Table 1 can be improved by choosing a minor value of 1 or by choosing larger values of k2 and
k3 .
