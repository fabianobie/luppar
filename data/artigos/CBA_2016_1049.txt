Abstract This work presents a controller design to an electrohydraulic actuator applied to movable nozzles on microsatellites
launchers vehicle and sounding rockets using models obtained from closed loop identification, to improve requirements to stepunit response as rise time (bandwidth) and overshot. The plant identification or dynamic_system identification to the Electro hydraulic actuator was obtained preliminarily using subspace methods. The actuator is being developed to TVC system applied to
Brazilian nozzles to attitude_control, at the Aeronautic Technician Center (DCTA). The design criteria is to obtain rise time lower
than 60 mili-seconds and 20 percent of overshot. The open loop transfer functions were identified from tests using simple proportional controllers and the controller designed is performed using the multiple rootlocus approach. The digital controller is implemented and validated using a real-time system. Others control extrategies are discussed using analog and digital controllers to the
electrohydraulic actuator. Unit-step response are compared using closed loop data from test for validation.
Keywords Electrohydraulic actuator, controller design, system identification.

Introduction

The thrust vector control system applied to attitude_control consists of a movable nozzle operated by
an electro-hydraulic actuator (EHA) and a flexible
joint, as shown in the Figure (1). This system is applied to controlled vehicles, e. g. the Brazilian Microsatellite Launcher Vehicle VLM-1, described in
details in (Loures da Costa et al., 2012), and to sounding rockets purposes. Actually new extrategies are
being considered concerning the development of new
technologies to the EHA to support such vehicles. The
EHA is one of them, where the Institute of Aeronautics and Space (IAE) has projects focused on Pressure Fed Systems (PFS) using different hydraulic
pressure, new materials, gas, new cylinders, new
controllers and electro hydraulic servo valves
(EHSV).
The EHA is a device that has an important function in TVCs systems (Cornelisse et al., 1979), and so
its complete dynamics behavior must be known in
details. The IAE facilities permits the characterizing
and to test several types of EHA, presented in the Fig
2. It consists of a workbench with a mass-spring-

dump load attached to the rod of the EHA. A real-time
system is available to digital control design validation,
as well as to open-loop and closed-loop identification.

The EHA can operate in open-loop or closed-loop
manner detailed in (Merrit, 1991) and (Jelali and
Kroll, 2003). In the first case some EHA needs an
external feedback because its integration action. In the
second case the external feedback can be used to
improve dynamic response like time-domain specifications as well as to reduce or eliminate the steadystate error. So it is mandatory the identification of its
linear or nonlinear dynamics, to control designs and
validation. This work presents the results obtained
from PID control design based on models from
closed-loop identification using subspace approach
and the multiple root-locus technique to control design and validation to a specific EHA.
In (Barbosa et al., 2013) is discussed a nonlinear
dynamic behavior to a TVC system using this EHA.

The identification processes detailed in (Ljung,
1999) and the subspace identification methods refers
to an algorithms class of parametric identification
where model form is on discrete state space, according to (Katayama, 2005) and (Machado, 2013). SIM
methods (subspace identification methods) have a
main character recover the system matrix from a vector projection from observed input-output data (Moor
et al., 1996). The classical application of identification
techniques consists in tests with system operating in
open-loop operation and the noise is uncorrelated with
input data. In this case, the SIM methods seems work
well. However, in some cases it is not possible to
identify the system in open-loop, due to its instability
behavior (unstable in open-loop, integrator behavior

3615

or security condition), the closed-loop identification is
necessary.
The main difficulty with closed-loop identification is the correlation with noise and the input data
caused by feedback. In this sense, SIM methods
seems produce results more favorable than classical
methods. In this work the SIM method known as
DSRe (combined deterministic and stochastic system
identification and realization), proposed by Ruscio
(2008), can be applied in both cases open and closedloop. The linear model obtained from the subspace
method was chosen as a third order, so we have
x k 1  Ax k  Bu k  K k
y k  Cx k   k

which xk is the system states vector, uk is the input
vector, yk is the output vector and "k is the innovation
method. The identification problem consists in determine the model matrices A,B and C and the Kalman
gain K. The matrix D is assumed to be null. The
DSRe algorithm proposed by (Ruscio, 2008) is a
SIM method composed of basically two steps. In the
first step the experimental data are separed in two
components, a signal named yd J1 and a innovation
sequence, "J1. In the second step, a state space
model is obtained from deterministic identification
deterministic, described in (Ruscio, 2008).
The algorithm DSRe proposed by (Ruscio,
2008) was implemented in (Machado, 2013) and applied for system identification.
In (Machado, 2013) the first step is according to
the original version, however opted to use the deterministic subspace algorithm N4SID (numerical algorithms for subspace state space system identification)
to solve the determination the order and system matrices. The Figure 8 presents the block diagram of algorithm DSRe. The identification parameters are the
past horizons J and future horizons L used to construct
the data matrices.
The SIM method apply LQ factorization (transpose of QR factorization) and SVD decomposition
(singular value decomposition), in (Aguirre, 2007), to
obtain, respectively, the observability matrix, and
model of order n. Then finally, a state sequence estimated, we can obtain the matrices A, B e K solving
the LS (least squares) regression problem.

The PID controller, described in widely literature

1991), improves the dynamic response as well as to
reduce or eliminate the steady-state error. The actually

The closed-loop model identification is the solution to some EHA identification just because the integrator characteristic of such devices in open-loop
operation.
The multiple root locus associated to the golden
rule can be applied, with good results, to the PID
design control and it can be verified that the closed
loop poles stays at the LHP (s-Laplace domain), just
collecting the multiple root locus in an interesting
direct and ordered manner. The multiple root locus
permits to observe the tendency of poles migration
through the root locus and so to choose the limits on
its parameters.
This approach considers only simplified linear
model and any nonlinearity effect must be verified
with nonlinear techniques analysis.

6 Conclusions
The main conclusion of this work is that the
closed loop EHA design presented performance according to EHAs applied to TVCs systems. The success on PID design using identified model from subspace approach was discussed in details, as well as the
design toll known as multiple root-locus technique.
The PID controller was validated using a real-time
platform.
The PID controller and the EHA presented a rise
time and overshot of 35ms and 28 respectively,
attending the preliminary design requirements. Some
results from simulations presented undershot due to
zeros in the identified plant.
This work is a guideline for next controllers design applied to Brazilian EHA projects, as well as to
electro hydraulic servo-valve preliminary projects.
