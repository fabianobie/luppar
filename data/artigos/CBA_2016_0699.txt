Abstract This work describes the modeling and control of a tilt-rotor UAV with tail controlled surfaces
for path tracking with improved forward velocity. The dynamic model is obtained using the Euler-Lagrange
formulation. Mixed H2 H controllers are designed for different operation points, whose feedback gains are
interpolated by a neural network for online gain-scheduling, performing a smooth transition between them.
Simulation results show the control strategy efficiency when the UAV is designated to have a forward acceleration
and do a circular trajectory, subject to wind perturbation.

Introduction

A tilt-rotor is a kind of aircraft that can perform vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) like
rotary-wing airplanes, and at the same time, by
tilting the rotors, can perform like a fixed-wing
aircraft in forward flush, which substantially improves both performance and power consumption.
Examples of tilt-rotors are the XV-15 (Nasa, 1975)
and V-22 Osprey (Norton, 2004). These vehicles
are ideal for some situations, since they do not
need a wide area for take-off and landing. In
small scale this UAV configuration can be used
to perform, for example, bridge inspection looking for structural cracks, and search and rescue
(Ryan and Hedrick, 2005). Moreover, due to its
reduced number of rotors, these vehicles performing VTOL have the advantage, when compared to
quad rotor UAVs, of lower energy consumption.
There are many works that propose control strategies for this class of UAV based on
helicopter flight-mode model to solve the path
tracking problem PID (Papachristos, Alexis and
Tzes, 2011), backstepping technique (Kendoul
et al., 2005), linear model predictive controller
(LMPC) (Papachristos, Alexis, Nikolakopoulos
and Tzes, 2011), H with D  stability (Almeida,
2014), feedback linearization with PID (Almeida
and Raffo, 2015) and robust linear mixed H2 H
optimal controller (Donadel et al., 2014). However, all these works neglected aerodynamic forces.
To improve the flight performance, tail sur-

ISSN 2525-8311

faces are added to the UAV, since when it is in
helicopter flight-mode (low velocity) the deflection
of rudder or elevator do not produce significant effects, as opposed to in forward flights, where low
deflection in these surfaces can make great difference in forces that act on the vehicle. Although
the flight performance improvement is achieved
with vertical tail plane (VTP) and horizontal tail
plane (HTP), the control design becomes challenging. In this work we present an approach for dealing with this problem, by designing an adaptive
controller based on online gain-scheduling using
neural network (NN).

Modeling

This section develops the tilt-rotor UAV dynamic model using the Euler-Lagrange formulation.
2.1

Forward kinematics

The tilt-rotor UAV considered in this work
is formed by three bodies. The main body is
composed by the fuselage, horizontal and vertical stabilizer. The reminder two bodies are each
of the two thrusters groups (servomotors with rotors) interconnected to the main body by revolute
joints. In order to obtain the forward kinematics, seven frames are defined, as shown in Figure
1 the inertial frame I the body frame, B the
main body center of mass C1  the two thrusters
group center of mass, C2 and C3 , correspondent to

Generalized forces

The vector of generalized forces   R81 in

  PR + PL + sR + sL + f + h + v , (2)

where PR and PL are generalized forces generated by propellers, sR and sL are applied by
servomotors, and f , h and v are generated by
the fuselage and the horizontal and vertical stabilizers, respectively.
The forces and torques contributions are
added using the maps f  (Jp )0 f I and  
(WF )0  I (Kane and Levinson, 1985), where Jp is
the linear velocity jacobian associated to the force
application point, and WF is the angular velocity
jacobian of the body with attached frame F, to
which the torque is applied. The terms f I and
 I are the applied force and torque, represented
in the inertial frame.

Control Strategy

Since the aerodynamic forces are proportional
to the square of the aerodynamic velocity, during hover flight, the horizontal and vertical stabilizer do not produce significant forces, and both
the longitudinal and directional control need to
be performed with the thrusters groups. This
changes during forward flight, where both longitudinal and directional control is conducted using
both the horizontal and vertical stabilizer rather
than using the rotors. This posses a challenge regarding the nonlinearity of control selection that
is hard to deal using a simple linear controller.
In this work we propose an adaptive_controller
based on gain-scheduling to solve the path tracking problem.
Robust mixed H2 H controllers are developed to stabilize the altitude and attitude for different operation points, providing also disturbance
rejection with an improved transient response. In
addition, based on the current state of the system, a neural network is used to schedule the synthesized controllers, by interpolating their gains,
considering the neural network learn and generalized factor (Haykin, 2001), providing an online
smooth transition between controllers. Furthermore, a kinematic controller is designed to the
translational control. The control structure is illustrated in Figure 2.

an improved transient response of the system. The

problem, maintaining H constraints providing
the advantage of a small H norm and a better
transient response.
To solve the mixed H2 H control problem,
the following optimization problem must be considered for   .

Robust Control Design

The inner-loop controllers, for the chosen
operation points, are designed using the mixed
H2 H control law technique based on the following system (Donadel et al., 2014)

where Cz , Duz and Dwz are constant matrices
that must be adjusted.
The optimal H controller asymptotically
stabilizes the linear system and minimizes the
H norm, Hwz (s)  sup(Hwz (jw)), where
Hwz (s) is the transfer function between the external disturbance w(t) and the cost variables
z(t). Applying the Parseval theorem results in
z(t)2  Hwz (s) w(t)2 , in which clearly
minimizing the H norm minimizes the disturbance effect on the system. In this work, differences between the linear model used for designing
the controller and the real one is treated as perturbations. To solve the H problem, the following
optimization problem subject to LMIs is considered

Gain-scheduling using neural network

A neural network called multilayer perceptron
(MLP) with one hidden layer and one output layer
is used to interpolate the controllers. To train the
neural network some considerations are used i)
if the hidden layer has many neurons, the interpolation can perform curves between gains, which
is not desired ii) if the number of neurons in the
hidden layer is not enough, the interpolation is
not sufficiently adjusted to solve the problem and
iii) the more operating points are considered more
controllers are tuned, which leads to an improvement of the neural network adjustment.

as shown in (13), (14) and (15) for the three linear systems. An optimal   was obtained and a

problem. The obtained controller feedback gains
K1 , K2 , K3  R618 are transformed in vectors k1 , k2 and k3  R1081 and used to train
the neural network. The neural network inputs
are the forward velocity operation-points values
uop1  0 ms, uop2  6 ms and uop3  12 ms.
A neural network MLP was configured with 4 neurons in the hidden layer with hyperbolic tangent
activation function, and 108 neurons in the output
layer with linear activation function. The neural
network was trained using the Bayesian regularization backpropagation with 100 epochs, which
produces an interpolation MSE (Mean Square Error) 3.57.108 . The kinematic controller (12) was
adjusted with ku  0.1, kv  0.04, and kw  0.1.
By using the adaptive_controller proposed and
starting with initial conditions over the trajectory, the tilt-rotor UAV was designated to perform a forward acceleration along the path xr (t) 
0.25t2 , yr  0, zr  10 and r  0 during the
first twenty seconds, then do a circular trajectory given by xr  rt cos((2(t + 40)80)) + 100,
yr  rt sin((2(t + 40)80)) + 127.5, zr  10 and
r  (2(t  20)80), with radius rt  127.5m.
A perturbation with respect to inertial axis x was
added at time 10s, as shown in Figure 6.
The results in Figures 3 and 4 show that the
tilt-rotor UAV tracks the trajectory x, y, z, 
maintaining the other states with a small error,
even under a time-varying disturbance. The control signals, shown in Figure 5, were maintained
bounded.

Conclusions and future works

This works presented the modeling and control of a tilt-rotor UAV with tail control surfaces.
Linear state feedback mixed H2 H controllers
were designed for different operation points, and
a gain-scheduling scheme, using neural network,
was applied in order to solve the nonlinear control problem. Under numerical simulation it was
shown the controller efficiency, when the UAV was
designated to perform a forward acceleration followed by a circular trajectory, with a time wind
varying perturbation.
Future works include test the controller under real flight experiments to validate the mod-

eling and control efficiency. Furthermore, to improve the energy consumption and, consequently,
increase the autonomy, the next step is to design
the tilt-rotor UAV with wings and design a controller using a similar approach to solve the problem.
